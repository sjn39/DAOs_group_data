                    "content": "As you may remember (link to a respective forum post), the FATF is expected to issue its amended guidelines on crypto very soon. This document may become the cornerstone of the global AML framework for DeFi and, as such, may be very relevant for Maker. Let\u2019s wait for the final document before discussing this specific topic further. However, it\u2019s a good occasion to start mapping out general policy challenges and opportunities for Maker. Why is this relevant? Significant policy and regulatory developments are often game changers in terms of projects\u2019 competitive (dis)advantages. On the one hand, restrictive guidelines may stifle Maker\u2019s growth. On the other hand, it may turn out that what will be a bump in the road for Maker may be game over for stablecoin newcomers. I want to underline the last point. Monitoring, analysing and responding to policy developments is not only about trying to survive in an adverse regulatory environment. A good understanding of policy trends and an ability to influence them and adapt to changing circumstances is a great opportunity for Maker to excel\u2014especially with all plans to onboard RWAs and scale up beyond the crypto bubble. To put it simply, it is not enough to survive and avoid regulatory scrutiny. To grow and outcompete traditional finance, Maker will need sophisticated regulatory thinking embedded in its overall strategy. Notably, the release of FATF guidelines will be a significant, yet just one of many developments that have taken place over years. I want to kick off the discussion over what is and what is not relevant and see the community\u2019s thinking about some of the emerging trends. These are some of the most notable trends of relevance for Maker:  Regulation of stablecoins  Obviously, Dai is the core product of MakerDAO. It has already been a few years since stablecoins became one of the main topics of interest for policymakers, financial regulators and central banks. Initially, the work was focused at the international level; it culminated in October 2020, when the Financial Stability Board has issued their recommendations in terms of regulation of global stablecoins, among the work conducted by the FATF, BIS, IOSCO, OECD, etc. Currently, we have entered a phase of building national regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, including MiCAR in the EU, plans in the UK, some attempts in the US, etc. The results of these ongoing processes will decide the fate of Dai, especially as a widely available and freely tradable asset (in particular for retail holders and use in incumbent finance). Of course, developments in terms of central bank digital currencies are also going to be very relevant.  Regulatory scrutiny on DeFi  Since Maker is a major player and pillar of DeFi, any significant regulatory scrutiny of the space may have a huge impact on Maker, including its ability to grow and make an impact beyond core crypto. It is the DAO\u2019s homework to think about potential vector attacks in terms of the entire DeFi space and those relevant and/or specific to Maker. The list includes securities law and banking law. Even if scrutiny is not directly applied to MakerDAO, it may harm the DAO and its ability to grow.  New approaches to regulating DeFi  Similar to the one above, this trend is also about how policymakers approach DeFi. However, the difference is that beyond the enforcement of the current rule, I there is a lot of actual interest in policymaking and regulatory circles in terms of understanding what DeFi is all about and how it could be regulated. This discussion is, to some extent, still happening behind closed doors, but the recently published WEF DeFi Policy-Making Toolkit may give you a feeling of what the discussion topics are. While it is not about direct enforcement, the long-term impact may be a big challenge\u2014as part of the discussion, there is a trend of looking for so-called regulatory access points beyond traditional financial intermediaries, which is directly relevant for Maker (e.g. because of the structure based on core units).  AML/KYC and sanctions regimes  Because of the aforementioned new FATF guidance (but also steps already considered by individual countries\u2014remember the US FinCEN\u2019s proposal?), this is one of the most urgent and important areas for Maker (and all DeFi). Some of the proposed approaches may hit the very core of DeFi, as they may petrify the role of traditional intermediaries in financial services, overburden individuals, DAOs, etc. with regulatory obligations and liability, impose unrealistic requirements on decentralized structures and create huge tensions between the overall anonymity of DeFi and the forced transparency of financial transactions. This is far from a complete list of challenges, opportunities and trends and naturally provides a very basic outlook. Let\u2019s start discussing these topics though. Please help expand the list and provide your own thoughts, which could lead Maker towards determining its strategy and action items. ",

Your post highlights some of the significant challenges and opportunities Maker as a DAO will potentially face. I want to add one which is a Marketing-related challenge:  Marketing of Maker Given the uncertainties mentioned in the original post, how we market the Maker protocol and DAI will need to be carefully examined for various jurisdictions. While the Strategic Marcomms unit I am proposing has a legal budget to ensure the marketing campaigns we run and the content we provide is legally sound, it is unclear to me whether all units or future CUs are aware of such regulatory risks and have a plan in place.      jacek:  To put it simply, it is not enough to survive and avoid regulatory scrutiny. To grow and outcompete traditional finance, Maker will need sophisticated regulatory thinking embedded in its overall strategy.   Jacek, how do you think we can foster more sophisticated regulatory thinking in the community? One idea I have is to increase awareness by hosting a monthly conversation where the community can get regular updates related to regulation. These policy challenges, opportunities, and trends are longer-term, and we need to be vigilant and stay a step ahead even if possible in risk management. ",

                    "content": "Hi, long-time lurker to this forum, but concerned Maker holder.  It seems to me that the uncertainty around regulation, and whether or not MakerDAO is willing and able to deal with it, will continue to create a downward pressure on the price of the MKR token, and will cause potential DAI-minters to look towards less complicated, more \u201cunderstandable\u201d forms of stablecoins until the space is appropriately regulated.  There is no more pressing issue that the DAO should be concerned with than how it will survive regulation.  I continue to not see this question answered across the forums, and as a person with great interest in Maker I am writing this reply full of concern about where we are headed. True DeFi-hards can moan about their concerns about the USDC consortium, and note DAI\u2019s strength as a decentralized currency, but at the end of the day USDC is regulation ready.  They have a group of people who are paid to prepare the books, ensure due diligence can be done by TradFI folks investigating potential trades, and when regulators inevitably come calling, they\u2019re ready to explain their product, what they do, and how it is backed.  Is MakerDAO ready for this? This is not an academic discussion; the regulation train is coming, and we need to be prepared.  It\u2019s not just the potential legal ramification that comes from MARCOMMS, it\u2019s everything.  It\u2019s the whole MakerDAO ecosystem.  Can we explain it easily?  Can we show it is auditable?  Can we prove it is resilient? Have we tested it in anything other than the real world?  While I think the answer to all of these questions is yes, I worry that the decentralized nature of the DAO will work against us when traditional regulators come calling. I work in government; I make policy for a living.  I have never felt more strongly that the MakerDAO Foundation should be re-established specifically to deal with this problem.  When regulation emerges, it is going to take teams of people to implement it, ensure it meets the legal ramifications of the regulators in question, and then prove it to those regulators.  As policy changes roll out, that same team will need to make revisions to ensure compliance.  If Maker aspires to be the Central Bank (or a bank; or something else entirely that even looks like a bank to regulators) then it needs to come to terms with this. The 80 or so million that the DAI is projected to make this year will be wasted if it is not put, in some small way, towards ensuring that the DAI remains a viable stablecoin through the roiling sea of regulations that are about to hit it. If this means hiring lawyers, hire them; if this means bringing back the Foundation to set and maintain a long-term strategic vision, then bring it back. Pulling in real-world assets and pushing DAI across new platforms is all interesting work that will boost profits in the near to mid-term.  However, the potential for regulators to establish criteria that we cannot manage is a potential game-ender for the DAO. Someone is going to reply to this and tell me that this is already being done; that the MakerDAO is all over this.  But who is responsible for this specifically?  Are they full or part-time?  Again, rooms and rooms of people perform regulatory compliance for major banks; what is our equivalent?  We have almost 5 billion dollars in our coffers, and we\u2019re going to post a profit this year of 100mil.  What is the equivalently sized bank\u2019s compliance division size? My proposal is fairly straightforward.  We need to 1) establish full-time positions associated with legal compliance and, 2) establish a more understandable legal framework for the MakerDAO organization.  The DAO, which currently only exists as a legal entity in a few States, should consider whether or not it is an appropriate organization to continue running Maker when regulation is announced.  We should have a team working now on getting us ready for that eventuality. I\u2019m not one of those people that contributes a lot on these boards; I know you are all working very hard to make Maker the best product it can be, however I see the bow wave of this thing approaching and it makes me fearful that all your work will be for naught if we don\u2019t deal with it proactively.  Thanks again for letting me be involved and say my piece, and thanks again for everyone\u2019s great work thus far! ",

Note that the Fed said yes when we asked it to dance for tomorrow. Hopefully we can get to know one another better from here. There is also a proposal for a new CU that has the goal of Maker owning $1 trillion in US Treasury debt in the next five years. Playing by the rules and building relations with government is the next stage of Maker\u2019s growth. We definitely need a more comprehensive plan, but there\u2019s more support than you think for Maker dressing in a three-piece suit and being the adult in the DeFi space.

A good case in point was how industry reacted to Treasury\u2019s midnight rule-making last December. I personally think a change in tenor at the OCC or FinCEN could have a significant impact on DeFi in total but, to date, those two agencies have been refreshingly forward thinking in regards to guidance/rule making.

In my view, there is a need for action in three streams:   Monitoring. At a minimum, we need to be aware of what\u2019s going on. The idea behind this forum post was to start the discussion, but also to provide a basic overview on what are the current policy and regulatory trends of relevance for Maker.  Advocacy. We\u2019ve been the first DeFi project with such an active advocacy agenda. At the Maker Foundation we\u2019ve run policy projects all around the globe, involving policymakers and regulators in many countries and international organizations. MakerDAO will need to undertake such activities too, for the reasons which I outlined in the first post in this thread.  Product strategy and design. Lastly, Maker has to embed regulatory thinking into its product strategy and design of particular features. There is a lot to win by doing this right, and a lot to lose by making mistakes.  It seems to me that these streams will require a dedicated workforce which should go much deeper than these high-level thoughts which we are exchanging here. I am not sure yet what\u2019s the most appropriate form. It seems to me, however, that the community should figure that out at the latest by this year\u2019s end. ",

I would say that at this point at least researching and considering a \u201cpermissioned\u201d approach is a necessity for market and business reasons, as pointed out by @MarianoDP :     MarianoDP:  All big institutions were asking about KYC in some form or another, not only circle.   For me the main question is how and where exactly the \u201cpermissioned\u201d aspects should be implemented. Ideally it is an option for those who need it, which does not negate the overall \u201cpermissionless\u201d approach and the open nature of the Maker Protocol. This is where Aave Pro seems to be going. Also, \u201cpermissioned\u201d approach may apply at various levels, and probably the farther from the core protocol and the closer to user interfaces, the better. However, we cannot just directly replicate the currently popular approach of parallel development of \u201cpermissioned\u201d and open versions of products. Except vaults, which as already discussed many times may be more or less permissionless in various ways, we also have Dai. Personally I would not want to see a \u201cpermissioned\u201d version of Dai, and yet this is exactly where some of regulatory developments in various countries are going (by adopting strict regulatory frameworks on stablecoin schemes). That\u2019s why we need to strategize and see what could be a potential adjustment, and what goes too far. ",

In a way this is not entirely different from entire portions of existing banking software e.g. used for InfoSec. The underlying protocol (e.g. UDP, RSA, Linux kernel\u2026) is opensource and maintained by open communities. But it\u2019s used within the systems of a \u201cpermissioned\u201d entity, behind firewalls etc. The entity may either utilise the opensource software directly and maintain integral its libraries/bin/versions/dependencies or contract a 3rd party intermediary that does that maintenance on its behalf (e.g. many companies like IBM etc do this).

These entities would be the go-between for institutional users who want access to the Maker suite of smart contracts.

At a minimum, we need to be aware of what\u2019s going on.    Second, we want to look for solutions which would not negate the core value propositions of the open and permissionless Maker Protocol. There seems to be rough consensus that while \u201cvault intermediaries\u201d which plug into the Protocol on pre-negotiated terms may act as regulated gateways with KYC measures (a.k.a. walled gardens), Dai should remain permissionless and fungible:     jacek:    Product strategy and design. Lastly, Maker has to embed regulatory thinking into its product strategy and design of particular features.    In order to make sure that this is a viable strategy, we need a bit of the third ingredient here:     jacek:    Advocacy. We\u2019ve been the first DeFi project with such an active advocacy agenda. At the Maker Foundation we\u2019ve run policy projects all around the globe, involving policymakers and regulators in many countries and international organizations. MakerDAO will need to undertake such activities too, for the reasons which I outlined in the first post in this thread.    Of course, this specific discussion is primarily driven by the fact that we see some segments of the market demanding some features (in this case KYC), and Growth et al. have already looked into it. One thing to underline is that in the future we may see cases in which commercially viable projects will bear some regulatory risks, which just have to be taken into account and overall assessment. Let me provide two examples of regulatory challenges which are more sophisticated (less obvious) than the permissioned vaults / permissionless Dai discussion:   We can see a regulatory trend that the mere fact that a given stablecoin refers to a fiat currency (even if via a soft peg like Dai) is a reason for a much more strict regulatory framework. While a soft peg to USD is a good idea for market adoption purposes, over time it may accrue a hidden regulatory cost when even soft-pegged stablecoins are subject to more rigid regulation (not to mention that \u201chardening\u201d the peg e.g. via introducing direct redeemability of Dai as proposed on forums some time ago would make things even more complicated).   Another trend that can be identified is the approach among some of the policymakers who even understand Bitcoin, decentralization, etc., but are having hard time understanding why the mere fact that there are multiple and anonymous governors of a system like Maker (as opposed to e.g. having just 1 MKR holder\u2014an interesting thought experiment) would be enough for not applying the entire regulatory framework. They understand the transparency, non-custodial nature, etc. and even have no problem with no-governance or almost-no-governance systems, but they are wondering why a system which is actively governed by a somehow decentralized crowd would be treated differently than the same system with just a single operator.   Just to make clear: in my view the above challenges, and many other ones, are solvable, and I am simply advocating for (1) discussions on these and similar topics, (2) making sure that MakerDAO can act in all three policy and regulatory streams: Monitoring, Advocacy, Product Strategy, in an efficient manner.

Looking at the latest report from the FATF, it becomes clear that the standard setters want to apply the same set of rules that currently apply to traditional finance. These legacy rules still require a legal entity or some person that can be held accountable. In DeFi, this person does not necessarily exist. The MakerDAO is one of the best examples. That being said, I am not convinced that DeFi should play according to the playbook of global standard setters. Instead, the industry should take a more proactive approach and develop new solutions that are acceptable to the international standard setters. The MakerDAO advocacy efforts and the WEF DeFi Policy-Making Toolkit you mentioned in your post are a very good starting point. Based on some ideas from the DeFi Policy-Making Toolkit, I am currently working on a new regulatory approach, and I would be more than happy to share some thoughts with you. I am not sure whether this is the right place to discuss it as it does not specifically deal with Maker. For DeFi, the way to mass adoption is not compliance with legacy rules but with a new set of rules that cater to the specifics of the DeFi space. Complying with legacy rules inevitably means more centralization. ",

                    "content": "I have been doing legal research in the crypto space for more than four years now and got increasingly unhappy with the overall direction. I don\u2019t think that regulation is necessarily bad. In fact, it is good if applied properly. At the same time, I don\u2019t think it is necessary to regulate everything as this inevitably stifles innovation and results in suboptimal outcomes. What I suggest is an opt-in approach \u2013 not only for the DeFi space but for crypto overall. To ensure that investors and consumers are sufficiently protected, this scheme would be combined with a certification scheme that allows investors and consumers to identify the regulated projects easily. I have written the following summary over the last few weeks and would appreciate your input. Please note that the summary only deals with the opt-in approach. It does not mention any details on the regulation of DeFi and should therefore only be considered a starting point for further discussions. I chose Japan as an example because Japan, as one of the first countries, introduced crypto regulations in 2017. I am also based in Japan and work for a Japanese law firm specializing in crypto. The following summary is my personal opinion and is not necessarily in line with my firm\u2019s opinion. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing your input and hope that together we can expand our research and efforts on it.   A New Regulatory Approach for the Crypto Industry  The crypto industry has come under increasing regulatory pressure. Whether it is the mining ban in China, the new crypto regulations in the EU, or the updated FATF guidance on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, the direction is clear \u2013 more rather than less regulation. Regulation is not necessarily bad as it allows institutional players to enter the space more easily. Yet, it inevitably increases compliance costs for projects in the crypto space and, in some cases, prevents companies from entering the space altogether. What is needed is a more balanced approach. An approach that sufficiently considers the benefits but also the costs of regulation \u2013 in other words, a new regulatory approach, an opt-in approach. Before taking a closer look at the opt-in approach, it is worth looking at the objectives of capital and financial markets regulation, the current regulatory approach and its shortcomings.  1. Objectives of Capital and Financial Markets Regulation  Capital and financial markets regulations aim to protect the integrity and efficiency of capital and financial markets, consumers and investors, and financial stability. A new regulatory approach that does not sufficiently consider these objectives is condemned to fail.  2. Current Regulatory Approach  At a very basic level, capital and financial markets regulation generally involves a three-step approach:   Analysis of whether an activity is a regulated activity.   Assessment of which person provides the regulated activity.   License and registration requirements with ongoing compliance.   In the past, the second step has not played a crucial role in the analysis. This has changed, however, with the emergence of DeFi. Today, much of the analysis is concerned with the question of whether there is a person engaging in regulated activities or not.  3. Shortcomings of the Current Regulatory Approach  The current regulatory approach has various shortcomings, both in design and execution. These shortcomings do not only negatively affect projects in the crypto space but also national regulators, investors and consumers, as well as the overall market.  3.1 Regulator From a design perspective, the current approach provides a one size fits all solution. As a result, entities engaging in regulated activities must comply with the same regulations irrespective of their size. This is meant to level the playing field and to ensure that only entities with sufficient resources provide regulated services. As regulators do not only deal with registered or licensed entities but also with entities providing regulated services without being authorized to do so, the current approach means that they must deal with a rapidly increasing number of new market participants. While FinTech has already posed a challenge to regulators, it is fully integrated into the existing infrastructure and run by profit-seeking companies. Crypto, on the other hand, does not necessarily have these ties with traditional finance and is typically run by open-source software on the blockchain. As anyone can fork the code and integrate it into their own projects, the number of regulated services provided via smart contracts is likely to grow exponentially. At the same time, the resources of financial regulators are only expected to grow modestly \u2013 if at all. Similar findings were made by the Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN) and presented to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2021.  According to data from Dune Analytics, the number of newly deployed smart contracts on Ethereum reached 2,702,142 in June 2021 alone. Assuming that most of these contracts can be used to provide regulated services, the supervision of the crypto space would bind a tremendous amount of resources. These resources would then be missing elsewhere, for example, the supervision of regulated entities. If this happens, regulators can no longer fulfill their mission to protect the integrity and efficiency of markets, consumers and investors, and financial stability, and the system becomes dysfunctional. The increasing scope and increasing decentralization add further complexity to the one size fit all approach. As can be seen from the communication of various regulators, already today, they act increasingly helpless. Without being able to enforce regulations outside their jurisdiction, they follow a name and shame policy and issue warnings. Even in the US, DeFi projects have not been the target of a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) so far. The regulators\u2019 problems at a glance:  exponential growth of crypto space international scope increasing decentralization   3.2 Projects and Companies Despite the problems outlined in the previous section, teams without sufficient resources may still decide not to proceed with their project because they do not have sufficient resources to comply with the regulations. Compared with international projects targeting their home market, they are at a disadvantage as enforcement against them is easily possible.  3.3 Investors and Consumers Investors and consumers are not necessarily the winners of regulation. While they are protected against certain failures, they are also likely to get access to less products and services. A good example is the Japanese market. As one of the first countries, Japan introduced crypto regulations in 2017. The regulations were updated in 2020 and provide market participants a clear picture of what activities are regulated. Because of the strict regulations and a lack of resources on the regulator\u2019s side, the Japanese market has not seen any innovation over the last few years. Only 24 tokens are currently listed on the 31 registered exchanges. None of them is a DeFi token. Staking services do not exist except for very few projects. Other forms of passive income are not available.  image800\u00d7450 27.7 KB  Investors seeking yield or access to certain products and services are therefore forced to go offshore. The strict regulatory environment therefore achieves exactly the opposite of what it aimed to achieve \u2013 less protection for Japanese investors.  3.4 Market At the moment, regulations benefit those who can afford to comply with them. These are not necessarily the best, but the best-funded projects. Innovation, however, in particular in the crypto space, does not necessarily happen within these projects. More happens outside. If the primary concern of all projects in the space would have been regulation, the crypto industry would not be where it is today. This applies even more if one considers that the regulations in all 195 countries vary to a certain degree.  4. New Regulatory Approach  Because of the shortcomings outlined in the previous section, a new regulatory approach is urgently needed. Ideally, the approach should not only overcome the outlined shortcomings but also promote innovation and the free flow of capital. Stated differently, what we need is a fundamentally new regulatory approach \u2013 an opt-in approach. Under the opt-in approach, crypto projects would not be regulated unless they explicitly opt in. A certification scheme would ensure that consumers and investors can easily identify regulated projects and are sufficiently protected. While the approach sounds rather disruptive, it is not as radical as one might first think. In fact, the situation is similar to today, where consumers and investors can opt out from the protection granted under their national laws. If a consumer, for example, wants to use an offshore exchange, he might simply open an account with the exchange, well-knowing that he is not protected under the laws of his home country. The opt-in approach on the other side, would require a user actively look for certified projects.  5. Benefits of the New Approach  The opt-in approach has benefits for regulators, consumers and investors, market participants, and the market overall.  5.1 Regulators Currently, regulators do not have sufficient resources to police the crypto space properly. Overall, this makes approval procedures slow and enforcement actions random. The opt-in approach would allow regulators to focus on the projects that have decided to opt in. The number of regulated entities would there-fore be much smaller than it is at the moment. Being able to allocate their resources more efficiently would also mean better services and stricter law enforcement, and as such, more products and a higher level of protection across regulated projects.  5.2 Projects and Companies The opt-in approach would further allow projects to decide freely whether they want to be regulated or whether they want to innovate freely. In many cases, projects might start in the unregulated space and migrate to the regulated space once they have sufficient traction and resources to comply with the regulations. The opt-in might also be considered as a good way to signal quality to the market and attract investments from entities that cannot interact with unregulated projects.  5.3 Investors and Consumers Having both regulated and unregulated products and services at the same time allows investors and consumers to choose freely from a large variety of products and services. For those who prefer to remain in the regulated space, it is possible to identify and verify regulated projects through the certification scheme easily. Investors who want to earn higher yields can easily access unregulated services without necessarily leaving their home jurisdiction. This is important, as it allows them to sue the teams behind those projects more easily. Just because a project is not regulated, this does not mean that investors and consumers are unprotected. In case of negligence or willful misconduct, the teams can still be held liable. Criminal sanctions in cases of fraud and other financial crimes also apply and offer a minimum level of protection. This disciplines the market and ensures a better quality of projects in the mid to long term. Despite being unregulated, the level of protection would, therefore, naturally increase. To prevent consumers from being exposed to unregulated projects, it should be considered to restrict financial intermediaries from promoting unregulated products and services to consumers. 5.4 Market The market would significantly benefit from the rapid innovation driven by unregulated projects. As indicated further above, much of the innovation would not have happened \u2013 or at least not at the same pace \u2013 if projects were primarily concerned about regulation from the very beginning. What is built in the DeFi space today can be used in a different context tomorrow. The unregulated space should be considered an excellent opportunity and driver for further innovation in the financial markets and elsewhere. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or programmable money, as they are sometimes called, may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of free innovation.  6. Conclusion  Much of today\u2019s research focuses on AML/CFT regulations only. Yet, a more holistic approach is needed to ensure that the funds can flow freely from the traditional regulated space into the crypto space. Proper risk weights, liquidity requirements and other measures must be implemented for financial institutions to ensure financial stability in stress scenarios. The requirements may be different for regulated and unregulated projects. More research is needed here. The same applies to market efficiency and integrity considerations. The approach outlined here should also ensure that projects and funds can move freely between the regulated and unregulated space. Finally, the opt-in approach should not be misunderstood as an approach where existing regulations are applied blindly to regulated projects. In fact, many of the regulations are still unclear and require further updates. Clarity by case law must be avoided at all costs. ",

Thanks a lot for your feedback @flipflopflapdelegate. I don\u2019t expect government agencies to inspect every single smart contract. This would be unreasonable. The number shown here is for illustrative purposes only as each of these contracts might be deployed for the provision of financial services - globally. Even if the number is much smaller, dealing with all the projects that utilize these smart contracts would bind a lot of resources. Composability adds another layer of complexity.     flipflopflapdelegate:  It\u2019s extremely difficult for current government agencies to keep up\u2014it\u2019s hard enough for someone like me to keep up\u2014but I do admire the effort of trying to provide guidance by Japanese regulators.

From my experience I can tell, however, that the regulations are not necessarily benefiting retail investors and consumers, and as far as I can tell, institutional investment in Japan is lagging behind other markets as well. Tax laws are another reason. ",
