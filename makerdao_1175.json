Core Values   Decentralization maximalist My votes will favor proposals that increase DAO participation by retail users, improve transparency of info between Core Units & retail users, and eliminate any unnecessarily centralized chokepoints that may exist within the DAO.   Trust minimalist My votes will favor proposals that reduce, not increase, the amount of trust that retail DAI users need to have in Maker Core Units and collateral agents.   Adversarial thinker My votes will favor proposals for economic & technical solutions that are immune to manipulation, exploit and/or attack by network participants, state actors, or any other party that may wish to disrupt the continuity of DAI.   Delegate Statement I was first introduced to MakerDAO in early 2019 when I discovered the burgeoning world of DeFi. I was thrilled to learn about the innovation of a decentralized stablecoin managed by a DAO. I worked with the Community team to develop explainer video content and participated in MKR governance throughout that year. I introduced many new DeFi users to the idea of a decentralized stablecoin through my video explainers.   Here\u2019s a video on DAI governance that I created 3 years ago that some of you may find entertaining! In 2020, I came to the realization that much of DeFi wasn\u2019t nearly as decentralized as it was advertising itself. At that point, I began to focus more on educating DeFi users about the importance of decentralization & trustlessness to our future economic freedom. Since that time, I\u2019ve watched MakerDAO mature into a truly unique organization, redefining the term \u201cDAO\u201d in the process. I believe that MakerDAO is now one of the most important initiatives - not just in DeFi - but in the entire world of global finance today. I want to help shape the next era for MakerDAO. Now more than ever, MakerDAO needs diversity in its governance input. I will provide that. While I tend to be a \u201cdecentralization maximalist\u201d, I also recognize that the problems that MakerDAO is trying to solve are far from binary in nature. Many of them require complex and thoughtful solutions that require trade-offs in both decentralization and trustlessness. I am not here to be an extremist or shut down conversations that aren\u2019t completely aligned with my point of view. I\u2019m not here to try to revert MakerDAO back to 2019. Rather, I am here to provide a strong (and sometimes contrarian) voice of support for the principles in which I believe, in the context of thoughtful and meaningful conversations. I\u2019m here to act as a voice for MKR holders who understand that trade-offs have to happen in the course of MakerDAO governance, but only when they are fruitful, secure and necessary. I\u2019m not coming into this as someone who has a firm position on every issue that the DAO is currently facing. I am coming into this as someone with a solid & proven set of principles that I will apply to Maker governance issues as they arise. I will participate in governance discussions and clearly explain my votes to you. I do not currently own any MKR. My goal and reason for being here is to help MakerDAO get to a place where I would feel comfortable owning MKR. Thank you for trusting me to vote on your behalf. Conflicts of Interest I have no conflicts of interest. I will disclose any that may arise in the future. Delegates Code of Conduct I have read the Code of Conduct and make best efforts to adhere to it. Waiver of Liability By delegating to Chris Blec, you acknowledge and agree that Chris Blec will participate in MakerDAO governance on a best-effort basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.

Admittedly I need to learn more about the plan to implement RWA. Again, I understand the allure, but I\u2019m not yet clear on how they can be implemented in a way that doesn\u2019t unbearably increase centralization. Long story short, we should avoid any centralized chokepoints unless they are temporary fixes with a desire to eliminate them long-term. Both centralized stables and RWA seem to fall into that category. ",

Governance benefits from having a diversity of viewpoints. If MKR holders choose to delegate to someone who doesn\u2019t own MKR currently but would like to if a specific benchmark is reached, and they want to support that delegate on their quest because they feel that it will benefit the entire MKR ecosystem if those goals are achieved, then\u2026 let\u2019s do it.

Neither my votes or my opinions in this post should be construed as investment, technical or any other form of advice. The opinions below are solely intended to inform readers about the rationale behind my recent MakerDAO votes, which I am casting voluntarily in an effort to add my unique voice to this open organization. I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation - June 13, 2022 YES: It\u2019s time to restart efforts to reward MKR holders for good decision making. Prior efforts required significant trust in a few humans. Presented here is a solution that allows the protocol to swap assets without any human ever taking custody of them and is clearly the direction the DAO should head for max trustlessness.   Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT - June 13, 2022 YES: While Velodrome is not a truly decentralized application and Optimism is not a truly decentralized layer2 network, there is still value for the DAO in incentivizing liquidity in AMMs that may attract significant amounts of attention. I am wary of the resources being spent by the humans of the DAO on side-projects like this and will be keeping an eye on the effectiveness of this one to inform future votes.   Add rETH as a new Vault Type - June 13, 2022 YES: rETH is an asset that epitomizes decentralization and trustlessness in the ETH staking arena. With the recent stETH failure, rETH liquidity has been able to grow to a level that will make it a very interesting & viable option for DAI collateral. It will be important to monitor the health of the rETH ecosystem because, as mentioned in the risk profile, there is a strong likelihood that it will be used for tight leveraging against ETH if added to lending products like Aave.   Community Greenlight Poll - KREDIKA (Kredika LTD) - June 6, 2022 NO: This is a complex proposal from a 3rd party company to essentially run an RWA operation on MakerDAO\u2019s behalf. The amount of trust that the DAO would have to put in this organization far surpasses anything that we should feel comfortable with. I do not plan to support any proposals, RWA or otherwise, that are incapable of offering total, complete and real-time transparency to the DAO.   Community Greenlight Poll - XSGD (StraitsX) - June 6, 2022 NO: This is a proposal for a centralized stablecoin backed by the Singapore Dollar. Centralized stablecoins should be added to MakerDAO as a last resort, and if they are added, they need to have significantly higher DeFi usage & liquidity. At this stage of development, this novel collateral type does not seem like a wise addition to the DAI ecosystem.   ",

Temporarily Disable the Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - June 15, 2022 YES: The current situation concerning Aave, Celsius & stETH is a concerning one. There seems to be a low likelihood of it affecting MakerDAO, however, when combined with Aave\u2019s single point of failure reliance on Chainlink, the D3M risk outweighs any potential reward. This executive is the right move to protect the interest of MKR holders. The D3M should only be reconsidered once Celsius is no longer a newsworthy risk and Aave implements a sanity check on its Chainlink price feeds.  ",

The opinions below are solely intended to inform readers about the rationale behind my recent MakerDAO votes, which I am casting voluntarily in an effort to add my unique voice to this open organization. I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) - June 13, 2022 REJECT: The concept of \u201cTask Forces\u201d does not align with my vision of a more transparent, less complex, maximally decentralized DAO. This is a proposal for a new Task Force therefore I am voting in opposition to its formation.   Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to IS-001 - psychonaut (MIP41c4-SP34) - June 13, 2022 NO: This boils down to an organizational issue. It is not apparent why ImmuneFi should be a CU at all. It should be contracted with the DAO and should have stricter obligations, metrics and general oversight than CUs have. For this reason, I am not in favor of expanding this CU.   Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to DIN-001 - tadeo (MIP41c4-SP35) - June 13, 2022 YES: Data Insights is a critical initiative for the DAO. I do not know tadeo but I have received positive feedback from trusted sources who are familiar with his work. I am voting in favor of this onboarding.   Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) - June 13, 2022 NO: First, as stated in my platform, I do not believe that the DAO should be engaging in activities that require large amounts of trust in isolated groups of individuals, have little to no real-time transparency, or that are not driving us toward a decentralized future. Second, every CU is incentivized to find ways to justify its own existence, and I feel that the proposed scope of LOVE would allow far too much subjectivity in that regard. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to measure whether LOVE was achieving satisfactory performance once it\u2019s created. For these reasons, I am voting against the formation of LOVE.   Ratification Poll for Task Forces (MIP75) - June 13, 2022 NO: MIP75 proposes creating small groups of individuals who will have vested power to engage in high-level decision-making about the DAO and its business.  This is an attempt to centralize power within the DAO and stands in direct opposition to my platform of maximizing decentralization and minimizing trust requirements. This is a DAO. Not a corporation. I stand against the concept of Task Forces as proposed.   Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) - June 13, 2022 NO: We owe it to MKR holders to keep their best interests at heart. The Surplus Buffer is an insurance fund. We should not be gambling it on experimental DeFi applications in an attempt to generate a return. DeFi is still a very risky world and this proposal presents far too much risk to the MKR ecosystem.   Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) - June 13, 2022 YES: I support these changes to the Executive Vote cadence. I see no downside to this schedule modification.   Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022 YES: DssKiln is an improvement upon the current flapper system. It is also the decentralized mechanism that the DAO needs to efficiently buy and sell tokens without needing to trust a human-run operation. The alternative is to entrust this role to humans within the DAO, which runs counter to the principles of decentralization and trustlessness that Maker was founded upon. I support the implementation of this new tech.   Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) - June 13, 2022 Approve existing budget only: I will maintain a generally \u201clean startup\u201d attitude toward CUs and based on the info I have at this point I see the current SF budget as adequate. In the future, I will be looking for ways to reduce CU budgets wherever possible to maximize efficiency within the DAO.   Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) - June 13, 2022 ABSTAIN: I am not yet familiar with how this system works or how it fits into MakerDAO ecosystem so I will abstain from this vote.   Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022 Approve existing budget only (BrandlessGrowth): I will maintain a generally \u201clean startup\u201d attitude toward CUs and based on the info I have at this point I see the current GRO budget as adequate. In the future, I will be looking for ways to reduce CU budgets wherever possible to maximize efficiency within the DAO.   ",

The longer term goal of MakerDAO should be to become as censorship-resistant as possible, even if it means sacrificing some stability. The PSM (the bulk of the USDC backing) was a trade-off designed to provide an incredibly stable peg. I believe that it went a step too far and that we may need to trade away some stability in exchange for increased censorship-resistance. ",

EXECUTIVE: Core Unit MKR Transfer and Advancing Collateral Offboardings - June 29, 2022 I was not a delegate yet when the polls resulting in this Executive occurred. I supported this executive to ensure the continuity of the governance ecosystem and to support the hat.   Prioritization Sentiment - Technical Resource Deployment - June 6, 2022 1ST CHOICE: Compound D3M 2ND CHOICE: Maker Teleport 3RD CHOICE: Collateral Onboarding 4TH CHOICE: DssKiln 5TH CHOICE: Target Price Adjustment Module (Vox) 6TH CHOICE: ESM Simulations 7TH CHOICE: Returning \u201cLost\u201d DAI My prioritization focuses on projects that will enhance the decentralization of the protocol along with projects that are critical to address ongoing market demand. Compound D3M is at the top of the list due to the opportunity to replace revenue and supply that was lost by the shutdown of Aave D3M and also due to Compound being a more decentralized alternative to Aave (due to Aave\u2019s total reliance on Chainlink\u2019s multisig). Teleport is critical in continuing Maker\u2019s effort to develop across chains (although I would like to get more info on how L2 multisig risks are being addressed). Collateral onboarding is a perennial priority for Maker and should always be near the top.   Prioritization Sentiment - Collateral Class - June 6, 2022 1ST CHOICE: Core Crypto Collateral 2ND CHOICE: Alternative Ethereum-based Crypto Collateral 3RD CHOICE: Broader Market Demand-Based Solutions 4TH CHOICE: Peg Stability Solutions Core crypto collateral will always be the nucleus of MakerDAO so it makes sense to have it on top of the list. Alternative ERC-20 collateral should be constantly considered - even though we are in a bear market now that\u2019s hurting demand, it will not last forever. Broader Market solutions like other risk-aligned D3M opportunities should continue to be researched, along with Peg Stability opportunities that do not rely wholly on the permission of centralized 3rd parties.

                    "content": "Hello Chris! First off, thank you for the work you and all the other delegates are doing for the MakerDAO ecosystem\u2026 And while I\u2019m writing to you specifically, I also welcome anyone else who feels compelled to reply to anything I have to say here to please do so (especially anyone I tag)\u2026  I do not currently own any MKR. My goal and reason for being here is to help MakerDAO get to a place where I would feel comfortable owning MKR.  So, this strikes a chord with me, because I, like you (as you stated in your video), have been in the crypto space for awhile now (since late 2017 / early 2018) and have been following / quite interested in MakerDAO for much of that time\u2026 And my issue with diving-in, learning more, and investing / getting involved up until now has mainly been that I just haven\u2019t had enough time for it all, and I didn\u2019t want to invest only to then allow my votes languish on the side-lines\u2026 That didn\u2019t seem fair to the ecosystem as a whole\u2026 Now, I\u2019ve only just recently become \u201ccomfortable\u201d with owning some MKR myself, especially in light of the new-ish ability to delegate my votes\u2026 So I picked some up, because I figured A) Maker\u2019s been around long enough now, and they really seem to have this decentralized governance thing pretty well down pat at this point (more on why I emphasize seem in a moment), and B) I can definitely afford to spend a couple/few hours researching delegates and find one that\u2019s right for me\u2026 Also, FWIW, I just never really see any MakerDAO news/discussions/rumblings on the usual channels I watch for crypto happenings, and I figured \u2018no news is good news\u2019\u2026 I presumed Maker was just too boring and steady for most of the \u2018moon bois\u2019 in the wider crypto space, which if I\u2019m being honest also helped boost my continued confidence in it\u2026 Ok, well, anyway, I\u2019m a few hours into researching voting and delegating now and\u2026 You know, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m not that dumb, but I am so, so lost and overwhelmed that I\u2019m starting to rethink whether I\u2019m smart / savvy enough to hold any MKR  For one thing, I initially liked a certain delegate based on their profile, their \u201cDelegate Platform\u201d post, and some other info about them; but then I saw some comments they\u2019d made around these forums, and the replies they got, and just the way they generally communicated with other delegates\u2026 And, unfortunately, it all put me off them a bit, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t feeling so sure anymore about how much I could trust what I read in, say, an \u2018official\u2019 profile/bio/platform-post about any given delegate\u2026 I mean, is there a process or committee to ensure information like this about delegates is accurate (as regards what they say they\u2019re about vs. what their actions say about them\u2026 which I guess may not even be possible\u2026 or perhaps that\u2019s specifically, by design, our job when choosing a delegate, is to weed through it all?) and is properly maintained / kept up-to-date (I\u2019m also noticing that many platform posts include an initial post with outdated data, like out-of-date \u201cCore Values\u201d lists, etc)? And for another (completely different) thing, it would seem that there\u2019s a bit of an upheaval \u2013 some non-insignificant drama at best, a civil-war at worst \u2013 happening within the ranks at MakerDAO at the moment\u2026? I see this, and more:    The Defiant \u2013 30 Jun 22    MakerDAO Jolts its Members with Bold Governance Proposals - The Defiant The great DAO test has begun.\u00a0There were always bound to be challenges running a new kind of business that relies on democratic decision-making. Companies, after all, tend to run optimally when they have clear, hierarchical control from a senior...  Est. reading time: 6 minutes        The quality of human interaction at MakerDAO is devolving. \u2013 ACREinvest via ACREinvest Delegate Platform - #28 by ACREinvest   I have thought long and hard on this, and due to the events of today I am formally announcing that when my contract expires (mid August) I will NOT be renewing my delegate contract or seeking another term. \u2013 @MakerMan via https://forum.makerdao.com/t/announcement-at-end-of-term-makerman-will-be-retiring-as-a-delegate   Sometimes I wonder whether some sort of agreed leadership between different groups is needed to ensure the efficiency and less drama. [followed by the \u2018Community Fire Pizza Meme\u2019] \u2013 @Doo_StableLab via Doo Delegate Platform - #29 by Doo_Nam  So, I obviously can\u2019t ask you (Chris) to speak on behalf of the people above, whom I\u2019ve quoted \u2013 I\u2019ve only provided that article and those quotes because they represent a side of things I hadn\u2019t yet seen or heard about \u2013 but I am interested to hear your thoughts and opinions (and again, those of anyone else who feel they can help provide some insight) on what exactly seems to be happening right now inside MakerDAO\u2026? How healthy would you say things are? And how can I, personally, gauge/assess the state of things on the inside? Because from an outsider\u2019s perspective, I\u2019m literally feeling like that \u201cDr. Steve Brule Meme\u201d right now: https://media.giphy.com/media/6RrNRHfNeyYpi/giphy.gif (it\u2019s the head-spinning gif, and it\u2019s really distracting, so I\u2019m just linking it instead of embedding it) Basically, I feel like I\u2019ve approached my initial research into Maker the way I normally would anything, and I don\u2019t think my efforts have yielded the kinds of firm results I\u2019d usually have by now\u2026 So at this moment in time I\u2019m just not sure how or where to get trustworthy data/insights for myself, as the project feels a little more like a black-box than I was expecting\u2026 Thanks again, especially for reading all of this (assuming anyone does) \u2013 MakerWOW p.s. Arg! Tried to post and was told that, as a new user, I can only mention two people, so now I\u2019ve gotta pick someone to leave out\u2026  ",

                    "content": "Hey there - thanks for reaching out - I took a few days off the celebrate American Independence.     MakerWOW:  I mean, is there a process or committee to ensure information like this about delegates is accurate   Nope. It\u2019s the wild west right now. There isn\u2019t even a process to ensure that each delegate is a unique human being. I\u2019d like to figure out how to implement some level of sybil-resistance for delegates at some point.     MakerWOW:  I am interested to hear your thoughts and opinions (and again, those of anyone else who feel they can help provide some insight) on what exactly seems to be happening right now inside MakerDAO\u2026?   There is a struggle going on inside of MakerDAO right now that can be summed up like this: one side believes that the DAO should operate in a maximally-decentralized, censorship-resistant, transparent, trustless way (I fall on this side). The other side believes that the DAO should maximize efficiency, speed and growth by creating small executive decision-making teams, centralizing power via multisigs, and so on. I believe that a DAO should be maximally-decentralized. Any centralization of power increases regulatory attack surface, and also opens up new avenues for whales/VCs to decrease transparency, run the DAO with their mega-voting power via delegates and shadow delegates, and ultimately create a \u201cdecentralization theatre\u201d situation. I am firmly against this and have been for years. You will find that some of the people who are suggesting more centralization and more \u201cexecutive rulemaking\u201d for the DAO are also people who are suggesting that they should be given those executive roles. Beware of this type of incentive misalignment.     MakerWOW:  I can\u2019t quite tell if you were also saying that you disagree with the entire idea of allocating any of Maker\u2019s funds to any ETFs, Treasuries, and other TradFi instruments\u2026   Historically I have been against real-world finance in general for DAOs for the simple reason that it is absolutely impossible to do this trustlessly. The current proposal for Monetalis to execute Maker\u2019s treasury strategy is also controversial because Monetalis is owned by MKR whales, hence incentive misalignment. There are many, many points of trust required to conduct this type of stuff and I generally believe that we should be minimizing trust. I haven\u2019t completely ruled out RWF because I believe that there is a way to do is in a trust-minimized way unto itself. Giving multisigs control of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars is wrong. Giving a 3rd party control of even more of the DAO\u2019s money (as long as they give us delayed \u201ctransparency reports\u201d) is wrong. The DAO deserves to have its eyes on the money at all times. This is what open blockchain tech is all about. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here. This would be inefficient, but it would reduce attack surface as much as possible. I think this could work. However, I don\u2019t think that anyone involved with RWF right now is interested in giving up control or efficiency. It seems like it\u2019s turning into an all-or-nothing endeavor for the DAO. If that is indeed the case, then I would be on the \u201cnothing\u201d side. Feel free to reach out with any other questions or thoughts, and delegate to me if you think I\u2019m lining up with your philosophy on the DAO. ",

I actually advocated for a slow-down on the move to delegation before it was implemented, to ensure that the DAO used every possible avenue to try to encourage more voting.     Why aren't MKR Holders voting? Governance       I would encourage the community to think of this less as \u201cset it and forget it\u201d delegation to an individual voter (which is really trying to solve #3), and more as \u201cactive participant\u201d unionization (which forces MKR holders to stay involved & informed but still give them a way to make their collective voice heard).     I even helped to test the idea of creating content (i\u2026e \u201cThis Week in Maker\u201d) to distribute to MKR holders to see if it would help. Clearly, it didn\u2019t. Voting languished and whales/VCs were dominating. From my POV, permissionless delegation is a decentralizing step for this DAO as it provides more opportunity for diverse opinions to gain real traction than they were able to before delegation was possible.

Neither my votes or my opinions in this post should be construed as investment, technical or any other form of advice. The opinions below are solely intended to inform readers about the rationale behind my recent MakerDAO votes, which I am casting voluntarily in an effort to add my unique voice to this open organization. I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Add RWA-009 (HVBank) as a new Vault Type - July 4, 2022 No: I\u2019m not anti-RWF. But I am anti-recklessness. I understand the desire to diversify collateral as quickly as possible, but only if all risks are properly addressed first. There are regulatory & political attack vectors that haven\u2019t been properly acknowledged. The current bank proposal seems to do a good job of addressing obvious legal risks. But it is unable to address risks posed by govts that are fine with acting illegally or immorally. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned over the last 2 years, it\u2019s that regulatory bodies are willing to act improperly if it will achieve short-term goals, even knowing that a court will overturn their improper action later. If a govt even hints at attacking Maker\u2019s real-world assets, it could send MKR and DAI into dangerous downward spirals. The attack wouldn\u2019t even have to actually happen for the impact to be felt. Until this is properly war-gamed, this attack surface shouldn\u2019t exist. I am not qualified to speak to the specifics of this proposal, but I don\u2019t need to understand them to understand the above. The abstract risks cannot be ignored, especially when they\u2019re happening in real-time to others in crypto & beyond. Adversarial thinking isn\u2019t optional here. This proposal is for a $100m initial debt ceiling with a goal of $1b in 12 months. The DAO could directly absorb a $100m hit, but not a $1b hit.  If it\u2019s approved, I will likely stand against future attempts to increase the debt ceiling. Keep in mind that even at $100m, the psychological impact of that $100m hit could make it much larger in terms of damage to MKR & DAI value. A compromise could be to limit % of total collateral that RWF comprises. But proponents of RWF have stated that RWF can have no limits. The ultimate goal is for it to comprise the vast majority of Maker collateral. This path is riddled with unvetted risks. Again, I\u2019m not anti-RWF. But I can\u2019t buy into it until these risks are taken seriously. These attempts to stabilize the peg could end up destroying it if things go wrong. Maker needs to account for every possible scenario. Not just the ones that seem likeliest today.   PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - July 4, 2022 Yes: I will defer to the recommendations of the Open Market Committee\u2019s on this proposal and support its decision-making with regard to these parameters.   Select a Target Level of rNPI Profitability to Guide Budget Cuts - July 4, 2022 Positive: The DAO should operate at a positive cashflow to increase the Surplus Buffer which would allow for a larger \u201cinsurance fund\u201d to mitigate impact of some of the risky RWF ventures, L2 experiments, and other projects that have the potential to pose existential & uncontrollable threat to the DAO. Based on my findings thus far, it appears that the DAO has grown too large and that it should be looking for opportunities to cut costs with regard to Core Units.   EXECUTIVE: Core Unit Distributions, Recognized Delegate Compensation, Keeper Network Stream Setup - July 06, 2022 I added my MKR in support of this Executive to provide my support to protocol security. I would like to call attention to the fact that Delegate Pay was bundled into this Executive so I was, along with all other Recognized Delegates, heavily incentivized to support it.   ",

Complementing points from @christiancdpetersen (re: regulatory) with a view on credit exposures. The view on uncapped RWA assets backing DAI is not a commonly shared statement as it not prudent to do so. That type of illiquid exposure will need to be built slowly and in lock-step with more liquid assets. I\u2019ve made a small summary in another thread which I am happy to dig into more detail elsewhere to explain the rationale. ",

I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Add RWA-008 (OFH) as a new Vault Type - July 11, 2022 ABSTAIN: My concerns about future RWA regulation, as mentioned in my previous post, still stand and are extremely relevant in this case. This vault is at serious risk if future action is taken against MakerDAO by regulators - regardless of if it is a legal or illegal action. However, at $30m, the debt ceiling is at a more tolerable level than the previous $100m (up to $1b) debt ceiling. I do believe that RWA vaults can work if they are constrained to a proper percentage of total collateral and if the DAO will not be destroyed if all RWA vaults are frozen by state actors. I would like to use this opportunity to start a conversation about how we can ensure that RWA vaults do not reach existential levels within the DAO. I have outlined some of those concerns here and will be planning next steps. If we can reach an agreement on what % of total assets RWA should comprise, then I will consider voting YES on future related proposals that are able to stay within the agreed upon guidelines. If we cannot, then I won\u2019t be able to support those proposals, no matter how lucrative they may be. RWA must be capped, even if it affects the DAO\u2019s growth in the short-term. In the meantime, I will ABSTAIN on this vote in hopes that we can have a productive conversation on this topic in the coming days and weeks.   Ratification Poll for Governance Facilitator Onboarding GOV-001 (MIP41c4-SP37) - July 11, 2022 YES: @Patrick_J  has been nothing but a pleasure to work with since I became a Recognized Delegate and I am happy to welcome him on board in this role.   EXECUTIVE: MOMC Parameter Changes - July 13, 2022 SUPPORT:  I deferred to the MOMC\u2019s findings in last week\u2019s poll and continue to do so with the executive.   ",

Community Greenlight Poll - bIBTA (Backed Finance Short-Term Bond ETF) - July 18, 2022 NO: Tokenization does not change the fact that multiple 3rd party TradFi institutions would need to be trusted to remain solvent and possibly defend the DAO\u2019s funds against hostile regulators. These are just some of the existential centralization & trust issues present here. Censorship resistance & legal resilience should always be among the DAO\u2019s top priorities, and this concept simply cannot offer it. Regardless of debt ceiling, I will likely be voting against the greenlight of this and other RWA collateral explorations until the DAO can commit to a renewed focus on growing decentralized vaults and capping the total % of DAI collateral that RWA is capable of representing with the goal of eliminating all avoidable existential risks.

PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - August 1, 2022 YES: I will support the findings of the Open Market Committee with these adjustments, although I am not totally convinced that dropping the yield bearing asset WSTETH to 0% SF is a prudent move. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this vault and offering feedback as the experiment happens.   Maker Teleport Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters - August 1, 2022 NO: As was surfaced in the forum thread supporting this proposal, Starknet is secured by  a single EOA that is capable of corrupting the network\u2019s core logic. This means that DAI holders will use Teleport to move genuine DAI to Starknet, but then will be required to trust Starknet\u2019s dev team to adequately secure the admin key. This risk has not been adequately to users to-date and members of MakerDAO continually write it off. I will continue to vote against L2 bridges and using L2s for securing PSM or protocol-owned funds until the DAO recognizes the incredible risks associated. L2s secured by developer teams should be treated just like any other real-world organization where trust is involved - legal agreements that protect the interests of MKR holders should be the standard whenever a counterparty is involved.   Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments - August 1, 2022 NO: I have expressed on calls and in the forum that this proposal treats Recognized Delegates as if they are a \u201cmanagement team\u201d. This forum reply explains why I think this is a bad idea and why I believe that Recognized Delegates should not be expected to reach offline consensus, as this proposal suggests.   MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll - Pando (Pando Investment Grade Climate Assets) - August 1, 2022 NO: This RWA proposal runs the same risks as all of the others. A regulator is fully capable of cracking down and affecting the DAO\u2019s access to critical DAI collateral. This is an unacceptable risk and CUs and Delegates have no right to push the MKR ecosystem into these kind of deals without considering these potential ramifications. RWA can be considered if it is kept to non-existential limits, however the current mentality of the DAO is to have unlimited amounts of RWA collateral, eventually making the majority of the DAO\u2019s activity centralized. This could end up being catastrophic if the regulatory tides turn against DAI. We should be building resiliency, not increasing the DAO\u2019s attack surface.   EXECUTIVE: HVBank Drawdown, Keeper Network Stream Re-Deployment - August 03, 2022 WAITING: I did not support the creation of the HVBank vault so I will not move my MKR to this executive until the vote has gained enough MKR to pass. I will update this post when I do so.  (UPDATE: Added MKR once the proposal passed to secure governance.)   ",

Ratification Poll for Modify Dai Foundation Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP74) - August 8, 2022 BEAR SCENARIO: Dai Foundation has a legitimate function and should continue to be funded by the DAO. The Foundation has made a clear case for the Bear Scenario that they\u2019ve proposed in the forum thread.   Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022 YES: These changes to the way that offboardings are proposed and handled seem sensible. While I do think that the currently proposed offboardings should be strongly considered, I also think that the process to propose them was too flimsy. The additional rigor should lead to better conversations around these proposals.   Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 ABSTAIN: I understand the tenuous situation created by possible budget cuts, but I do not believe that CUs should be sending ultimatums to the DAO in the form of \u201cI\u2019ll cut my budget if you leave me alone for a full year\u201d. Nobody knows what the next 12 months will bring, so this type of promise cannot be made in good faith. Rather than voting in favor of, or rejecting the current budget, I choose to abstain.   Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) - August 8, 2022 NO: A significant problem with any D3M implementation is that the risks presented by 3rd party multisigs or reliance on centralized oracle systems are practically ignored by the DAO. This modification would allow D3M to be used with even more centrally-controlled DeFi apps without any real thought given to the risks. I cannot support expanding the reach of D3Ms until the DAO chooses to acknowledge these untenable risks, which I\u2019ve detailed in other forum posts.   Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022 NO: Deposits on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Avalanche are all subject to the security of each chain\u2019s admin key. None of those admin keys have provable security and require full faith & trust in each core team. This makes those chains/L2s unsuitable for this type of endeavor. The DAO cannot put protocol-owned funds at the mercy of a few unaffiliated developers.   Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 YES: An organization that is burning cash like MakerDAO should not be putting on lavish events with a budget of over $800k/yr. This is not a reflection on the performance of the Events CU, but rather just a logical decision based on the apparent state of the DAO\u2019s finances.   ",

There is no option on this poll that acknowledges this direction so I am abstaining.   Collateral Onboarding Project-based Funding Request (PFR) - August 22, 2022 NO: All RWF activity should be halted until the RWF core unit is able to begin functioning autonomously or be adequately replaced by the DAO.

EXECUTIVE: HVBank (RWA-009) Drawdown - August 24, 2022 I oppose the contents as I believe that RWA is leading MakerDAO toward a path of destruction. But I am participating in this vote to support the security of the governance system.   Community Greenlight Poll - RWA Arranger (BlockTower Credit) - August 15, 2022 NO: This is another RWF proposal that requires complete trust in the integrity and honesty of the real-world 3rd party. This type of collateral proposal is not in the spirit of decentralization, it does not lend itself to DAO autonomy, and it is existentially dangerous to DAI in terms of regulatory uncertainty. A vote in favor of this proposal is a vote for a reckless and existential threat to DAI.   Community Greenlight Poll - Cabot (Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC) - August 15, 2022 NO: In addition to being entirely trust-oriented and dangerous at a regulatory-level, these mining proposals make no sense whatsoever because the DAO has no ability to liquidate the mining assets if the borrower goes underwater. Who at MakerDAO is going to liquidate mining units? Nobody. These proposals are constantly being pushed forward as some kind \u201cadvanced\u201d collateral concept that noobs are too dumb to understand. In reality, they\u2019re just bad, broken, and they represent the TradFi nonsense that Bitcoin was created to escape from.   Community Greenlight Poll - DDC (Detox Digital Coin) - August 15, 2022 NO: More of the same. No, real-world real estate consisting of literal detox medical facilities should not be used as collateral for DAI. Why? All of the reasons I\u2019ve mentioned above and hundreds of times before. I shouldn\u2019t have to read a proposal for DAI collateral that talks about whether or not a building is Coronavirus-proof. Yet, here we are. RWA needs to go. All of it. Before the rug gets pulled by both the TradFi borrowers and the regulating governments.   ",

PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - August 29, 2022 OPTION 2: I support the Open Market Committee\u2019s proposal to decrease stability fees on core crypto collateral in an effort to increase the percentage of total collateral that crypto comprises. DAO needs to take whatever steps are necessary to reduce the existential threat posed by RWA and the reduction of these fees is a key step.   Ratification Poll for Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP6) - August 29, 2022 ABSTAIN: I voted against the original bIBTA proposal and do not support this initiative. However, since the proposal was greenlit, I do not intend to obstruct its funding at this point. For that reason, I will abstain from voting.   EXECUTIVE: HVBank Drawdown, Maker Teleport Launch on Optimism and Arbitrum - August 31, 2022 I do not support the HVBank arrangement or official Maker partnership with Optimism or Arbitrum, however I moved my MKR to this executive after it passed to support the governance mechanism and the will of the whales.

I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Short Ratification Poll for Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund (MIP55c3-SP8) - September 5, 2022 ABSTAIN: I stood opposed to MIP65 because of its centralizing nature. However, this MIP was approved by MKR holders. I continue to oppose what is happening here however I won\u2019t try to stand in the way of MKR holders as they execute their own will.   Short Ratification Poll for MIP65 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP4) - September 5, 2022 NO: This appears to be some kind of workaround due to the ongoing RWF CU drama. It appears at first to be decentralizing in nature, as it opens up these \u201cverifications\u201d to the entire community. However, it then shows its centralized nature when it names 1 community member who is acceptable for this job. This is not the right way to handle this ongoing drama. Either fix RWF or get rid of it altogether.   MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for former RWF-001 Members - September 5, 2022 NO: This proposal asks for special treatment for 2 DAO members due to a broken \u201csocial contract\u201d. Just like with the Hasu situation, I suggest that rather than bending the rules to accommodate specific people, the DAO focus on fixing the broken system that allowed for this broken \u201csocial contract\u201d to occur and fix that. I will vote against any proposal that tries to do favors for specific people without fixing the system.   Updating HVBank (RWA-009) Legal Agreements - September 5, 2022 ABSTAIN: Similar to the MIP65 vote above, I will abstain on this one because, while I oppose the HVBank partnership, I also do not want to block the will of MKR holders as they attempt to execute it.   EXECUTIVE: Core Unit MKR Vesting, Recognized Delegate Compensation, MOMC Parameter Changes - September 07, 2022 Adding MKR this executive to support the will of MKR holders as expressed in the polls. The views that I expressed in the poll votes have not changed. (Also I\u2019d like to get compensated as a delegate therefore I am highly incentivized to support this executive.)   EXECUTIVE: Core Unit Budget Streams, SPF Funding, HVBank Legal Update, MKR Stream Accounting Cleanup - September 14, 2022 Adding MKR this executive to support the will of MKR holders as expressed in the polls. The views that I expressed in the poll votes have not changed.   Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI (Gelato Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI) - September 5, 2022 NO: I will vote against the onboarding of real-world assets or centralized custodial assets until the DAO commits to finding ways to reducing its RWA exposure. BUSD is a centralized custodial stablecoin that is capable of illegitimately freezing or seizing the value of the collateral even after it\u2019s locked in a vault. This disqualifies it from consideration for now.   Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 NO: As above, I am voting against onboarding more centralized custodial assets, even if they are managed as 3rd party liquidity. WBTC is obviously centralized, and renBTC has points of centralization that are capable of being attacked. This asset doesn\u2019t meet criteria for a truly decentralized collateral asset.   Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 YES: To the best of my knowledge, GNO is a decentralized asset on Ethereum that cannot be seized or frozen once it is locked as collateral. I support the DAO exploring adding GNO as a new collateral type.   ",

I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Ratification Poll for Amend Measurement Period For Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP24) - September 12, 2022 YES: This is a commonsense step to take with regard to getting a more accurate measure of the performance of a delegate. I appreciate that this MIP came about as a result of Hasu\u2019s prior situation. We shouldn\u2019t make one-off exceptions for individuals. We should pursue systematic change, such as this.   Ratification Poll for the MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set - September 12, 2022 NO: This MIP seeks to turn Recognized Delegates from a group of passionate governance participants into a highly-paid Board of Directors. I cannot support this. The maximum possible pay from $144k to $600k+ is outrageous and would irreparably corrupt MakerDAO governance by attracting career grifters who are just looking to appease VCs to keep their pay rolling in. Also, asking Recognized Delegates to vote on their own massive pay increase is unethical. Let\u2019s say what nobody wants to say but everybody understands - any RD that is voting in favor of this proposal is acting unethically.   Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022 NO: I am in favor of dramatically cutting DAO costs immediately, so I will not be voting in favor of pay increases. I also still do not understand, organizationally speaking, why this is even a core unit. I know that I\u2019m not alone in questioning the logic of this setup.   Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 YES: This is a modest budget and it\u2019s for a good cause. Raising DAI awareness in places where it can be useful is very important. As a caveat, due to the extreme existential threat posed by the PSM USDC, I would caution the Ambassador Program against evangelizing DAI in sanctioned regions such as Venezuela.   Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 REJECT BUDGET: I am voting against pay increases, especially ones of this magnitude. However, I would have given greater consideration to this poll if it had offered options of less than 100% matching MKR.   Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 YES: As the DAO is looking for costs to cut, this CU is a prime candidate for offboarding. The functions of this DAO should not be autonomous. They should be under a larger Marketing or Growth umbrella. This CU is the victim of poor organization. Also, as we are in cost-cutting mode, swag should not be a priority.   Community Greenlight Poll - RFA (RFA - Canadian Federally Regulated Mortgage Originator) - September 19, 2022 NO: I will not vote in favor of any RWA proposals as long as RWA assets are not limited to a safe and low percentage of total DAI collateral. In combination with PSM risk, RWA will ultimately end up causing a deadly blow to DAI. I\u2019m not in favor of playing chicken with billions of dollars of other peoples\u2019 money, as the majority of the DAO seems to be. As long as this threat exists, I am firmly opposed. DAI should be impenetrably safe for all ecosystem participants and a vote in favor of a proposal like this is a step in the opposite direction.   ",

The opinions below are solely intended to inform readers about the rationale behind my recent MakerDAO votes, which I am casting voluntarily in an effort to add my unique voice to this open organization. I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - October 3, 2022 YES: I am voting in support of the recommendations and forward guidance commitments by the OMC. The DAO should continually seek to lower, not raise, stability fees on crypto vaults.   Approve Multisig for Management of Velodrome NFT - October 3, 2022 NO: The DAO should never create a situation where a small handful of people are responsible for the safety and security of hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars. This multisig will put 6-7 figures of the DAOs money into the hands of just 4 human signers. This concept runs counter to principles of decentralization. I am against this multisig and all others that the DAO utilizes in this fashion.   Monetalis Clydesdale (RWA007-A) Onboarding, Funding Ambassador Program SPF, Core Unit MKR Streams and Transfers - October 5, 2022 Moving my MKR to this Executive does not signal my support of its contents. The views that I expressed during polling have not changed. I am moving my MKR solely to support governance as it executes the will of MKR holders as expressed in those polls.   Whitelist Oasis.app on rETHUSD Oracle (MIP10c9-SP31) - October 10, 2022 ABSTAIN: Abstaining from this vote because I am not fully informed on the issue. I researched the forum and chat for supporting information but could not find enough to yield an adequate decision (by my own standards).   Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters - October 10, 2022 NO: I stand opposed to continued efforts to increase PSM size and usage. The larger DAI\u2019s PSM balance grows, the more reliant the DAO will become on this centralized crutch. The Gemini proposal is clearly designed to grow the PSM balance, and voting Yes here would facilitate the growth of GUSD-PSM, so I am voting No.   End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022 YES: Sourcecred was a worthwhile experiment, but as was stated in the forum post, it has shown no indication of improving Maker\u2019s governance process. The incentives are misaligned when people are only paid to post on the forum rather than meaningfully participate in the holistic governance process (as delegates are). Rather than paying people simply to post on the forum, the DAO should explore ways to increase participation by MKR holders who already have a clear incentive.   MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 and MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 NO/REJECT on both: These proposals are designed to pave the road back to Aave D3M usage. I am firmly opposed to risking funds belonging to MKR holders in Aave while Aave has a single-point of failure in its reliance on Chainlink. Chainlink\u2019s multisig is currently capable, if compromised or used maliciously, of liquidating every loan on Aave. If this were to happen, the D3M funds would be lost and DAI would risk destruction. This is an untenable risk that the DAO has consistently & recklessly chosen to ignore.   ",

Community Greenlight Poll - ANCHORAGE (Anchorage Lending Crypto Mining) - October 3, 2022 NO: I am opposed to RWA proposals which take Maker assets off-chain and put them into the hands of offline entities that cannot offer real-time transparency. I am also opposed to RWA that would result in Maker assets being tied up by regulated entities that would be required to comply with legal requests to steal said assets. For these reasons and many others that I have expressed in the past, I am opposed to this proposal.   Collateral Auction Parameter Changes, MOMC Parameter Adjustments, Recognized Delegate Compensation for September - October 14, 2022 Adding MKR this executive to support the will of MKR holders as expressed in the polls.

The opinions below are solely intended to inform readers about the rationale behind my recent MakerDAO votes, which I am casting voluntarily in an effort to add my unique voice to this open organization. I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Enable DC-IAM for RWA-007-A (Monetalis Clydesdale), GUSD PSM Parameter Changes - October 13 , 2022 NO SUPPORT: I have been a vocal opponent of all aspects of the contents of this executive. I believe that this executive contains existential threats to DAI and I will not be supporting its implementation.   Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set - October 10, 2022 NO: I support some aspects of the Endgame Plan but do not support others. I believe that the elements of this plan should have been voted on individually rather than being pushed through in a \u201cone size fits all\u201d vote. For this reason, I am voting against.   Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Strategic Happiness Core Unit - SH-001 (MIP39c3-SP3) - October 10, 2022 YES: I believe that most Core Units should be offboarded to reduce DAO expenses and to push Maker closer and closer to a state of actual autonomy. Strategic Happiness is not a critical role for the DAO and it makes sense to offboard it at this time. I believe that the separation package is far too large however previous attempts with smaller packages have failed, so I will support this one.   Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Events Core Unit - EVENTS-001 (MIP39c3-SP4) - October 10, 2022 YES: Similarly to the previous vote, I believe that Events CU is not critical to DAI\u2019s decentralized success and should be offboarded at this time. Again, I\u2019m not a huge fan of these \u201cgolden parachutes\u201d but if this is what it takes to get offboarding approved, then let\u2019s get it done.   Ratification Poll for Offboarding the Real-World Finance Core Unit - RWF-001 (MIP39c3-SP5) - October 10, 2022 YES: The RWF core unit has obviously been a political nightmare. I believe that the function of this core unit should be eliminated along with the core unit itself. All RWF deals should be immediately halted until the DAO can figure out how to deal with the existential threat (regulatory and otherwise) that they pose.   Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding - RWF-001 (MIP41c5-SP12) - October 10, 2022 YES: As mentioned above, I am in favor of offboarding RWF Core Unit, its faciliator, and all of its assigned duties. Maker should not be engaging in RWF opportunities.   Ratification Poll for Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards (MIP81) - October 10, 2022 NO: I have been a vocal opponent of this proposal as I believe it allows Coinbase to capture MakerDAO entirely. The passage of this proposal signifies the final nail in the coffin for DAI\u2019s decentralization and censorship-resistance. With this vote, MakerDAO is pushing itself into a new era of centralized compliance.   Ratification Poll for Monetalis-Coinbase Appaloosa (MIP82) - October 10, 2022 NO: I am strongly opposed to all Monetalis/Maker activity. Taking the DAO\u2019s assets off-chain and investing them into regulated 3rd party custodians runs counter to everything that Maker was supposed to stand for. These votes will come back to haunt MakerDAO within the next 1-2 years.   Ratification Poll for Legal And Commercial Risk Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral BlockTower Credit - RWA Arranger SPF (MIP55c3-SP9) - October 10, 2022 NO: I stand opposed to all Maker RWA activity. I do not believe that the DAO should be onboarding organizations like BlockTower to do the work that has been proposed. I do not believe that the work that has been proposed should be done at all.   Ratification Poll for Facilitator Offboarding Process (MIP41c5) adjustments (MIP4c2-SP26) - October 10, 2022 YES: The proposed changes to Faciliator Offboardings seem commonsense. While they will shorten the window for feedback, they will allow for more rapid offboardings and allow necessary changes to occur while mitigating potential damage.   MIP65 Asset Reallocation - October 24, 2022 ABSTAIN: I stand firmly opposed to MIP65 and all Monetalis/Maker activity as I believe that it poses an existential threat to the DAO and to DAI. Since this vote is just on shuffling money around within MIP65, I will abstain from voting.   rETH Technical Onboarding, Enable Starknet DAI Bridge Fees - October 26, 2022 I have moved my MKR to this Executive in support of the decisions made during the polling process and to support the security of MKR governance.   Activate Liquidations for Stablecoin Vaults to Clear Bad Debt - October 31, 2022 YES: We need to get the bad debt off of our books. I do not know why liquidations were not activated when these vaults were launched (I\u2019m sure there was a good reason but I do not know it) but now that we are capable of liquidating these vaults, there\u2019s no reason not to.   One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit - October 31, 2022 NO: We literally just voted to offboard this Core Unit and now it\u2019s asking for just one more month. No, the decision was made for a reason, a massive golden parachute was paid, and this proposal at this point is really quite ridiculous.   PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - October 31, 2022 YES: I am voting in support of the recommendations and forward guidance commitments by the OMC. I continue to oppose Aave D3M due to its total reliance on Chainlink, but Compound D3M sanity checks Chainlink info against Uniswap and this is more acceptable from a decentralization point of view.

I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Add the Compound V2 DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - November 7, 2022 YES: I have opposed Aave D3M in the past due to Aave\u2019s complete reliance on Chainlink\u2019s price feeds. Compound, however, checks Chainlink\u2019s price feed against Uniswap TWAP to ensure that Chainlink is not sending bad data. For this reason, I continue to oppose Aave D3M but have no significant objection to Compound D3M.   Maker Teleport Technical Deployment on StarkNet, Recognized Delegate Compensation Distribution for October, MOMC Parameter Changes - November 9, 2022 I have moved my MKR to this Executive in support of the decisions made during the polling process and to support the security of MKR governance. Please note that I am financially incentivized to support this Executive as it includes delegate compensation.   Urgent Collateral Parameter Changes - November 12, 2022 I moved my MKR to this Executive after it had passed to support the security of Maker\u2019s system of governance. However I am not convinced that this vote needed to happen so urgently and am concerned about the lack of time offered to consider it.   Stablecoin Vault Liquidation Parameters and Auction Activation - November 14, 2022 YES: It is crucial for Maker to use a consistent liquidation mechanism across the board for all collateral types to maintain integrity. Activating liquidations/auctions on these stablecoin vaults to clear bad debt is a must at this point.   Parameter Changes for RWA-007-A (Monetalis Clydesdale), Enable rETH-A DC-IAM, Housekeeping Changes - November 16, 2022 NO SUPPORT: I am not supporting this Executive because I believe that the Monetalis Clydesdale initiative places the entire DAO at existential risk due to its unbreakable connections to the regulated real world. These are the kind of deals that will ultimately destroy the DAO.   ",

Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types (RWA010, RWA011, RWA012, RWA013) - November 21, 2022 NO: RWA deals such as this pose an existential threat to MakerDAO, DAI and MKR.

Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022 REJECT: I never heard of this core unit until this vote came up.

Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022 REJECT: This core unit should not even be a core unit since it\u2019s a separate company and it should be offboarded.   Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022 NO: I am voting to offboard this core unit so I don\u2019t think we need to spend any time adjusting its mandate.   Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 ABSTAIN: I do not have enough information on this issue to offer a meaningful vote.

Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 REDUCED: I support keeping this core unit and moving to the reduced budget.

Change of Ownership of the Ambassador\u2019s Program Multi-Sig - December 12, 2022 ABSTAIN: The forum post initiating this vote was vague, unclear and contained a broken link to supporting info. I do not understand how this multisig is configured, how much value it holds or why it exists. Instead of voting against, I will abstain and leave it to other voters who are more familiar with the situation.   Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll - December 12, 2022 ABSTAIN: I am not familiar with anyone who is running for the Foundation Board and will leave this decision to other voters who have had time to research the candidates.   Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 YES: SAS fulfills an important function within the DAO and the funding request for Q1 seems reasonable.   Governance Communications Core Unit (COM-001) Funding Request - December 12, 2022 YES: GovComms has fulfilled an important role within the DAO and I support this request for additional wind-down time.   Ratification Poll for Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication (MIP55c3-SP11) - December 12, 2022 NO: I\u2019ve read this proposal a couple of times but it remains beyond my comprehension. I don\u2019t think that the DAO should be engaging in things that Delegates cannot understand. Perhaps this concept should be broken down into chunks or better explained in plain English.   ",

The opinions below are solely intended to inform readers about the rationale behind my recent MakerDAO votes, which I am casting voluntarily in an effort to add my unique voice to this open organization. I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Approve One-time MKR Distribution to Correct CES-001 Incentive Program Shortfall - January 9, 2023 NO: Entrusting protocol-owned MKR to multisigs controlled by 1 person or a multisig is irresponsible and not decentralized. This is how we got into this situation in the first place. If we couldn\u2019t trust the last facilitator, then why can we trust the current facilitator? This isn\u2019t intended to be an insult - just a logical & rational question. MakerDAO needs a new system to secure CU funds that doesn\u2019t involve this level of trust, and that system should be used to make these CU members whole.   Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln - January 9, 2023 MAXIMUM MKR BURN: Maker should have restarted the MKR burn a long time ago. We need to make up for lost time. Burn $3m of MKR in the kiln.   PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - January 9, 2023 NO: All funds on Aave are secured by a single multisig held by Chainlink. If that multisig were to become compromised, the D3M would be lost and DAI would become considerably undercollateralized. As unlikely as other delegates believe that this is to happen, the fact that it can happen is too much of a risk for DAI. Aave D3M should remain deactivated until its Chainlink vulnerability is removed.   EXECUTIVE: Core Unit Budget Streams, MKR Vesting, Recognized Delegate Compensation - January 11, 2023 Supporting this Executive as it\u2019s executing the will of the DAO based on past polls, there\u2019s nothing existentially dangerous contained, and also I\u2019d like to get compensated.   Adjust the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling - January 16, 2023 AND Decrease GUSD PSM Fee Out (tout) - January 16, 2023 ZERO DEBT CEILING, TOUT TO ZERO: Gemini is having very well-publicized legal and financial problems. Verbal promises from its executives should take a backseat to protecting the solvency of DAI. Honestly, this PSM should have never existed in the first place since it placed the future of DAI in the hands of yet another CEX. But, here we are. Now is the time to end this PSM liability and re-focus the DAO\u2019s efforts on decentralization and trust minimization. The question is - can we learn from this Gemini situation? Or is the DAO simply doomed to repeat it again and again until disaster strikes?   ",

I am making decisions based on my own limited scope of knowledge and do not guarantee positive outcomes or accuracy.    Ratification Poll for MIP63 Maker Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) - January 9, 2023 ABSTAIN: I do not have enough information about how the Keeper Network works to be able to provide a meaningful vote on this issue.   Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 NO: In the beginning, I was a fan of this idea. However, in the last few months, it\u2019s become apparent to me that delegates and CU members see this type of fund as a way to be able to act with impugnity within their decisions about the DAO. I would favor a legal defense fund for very particular situations - i.e. regulatory actions - however having it cover an unlimited number of legal problems for delegates and CU members is not a good use of DAO resources.   Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) - January 9, 2023 NO: MakerDAO should be working to eliminate its existential reliance on the PSM USDC, not figuring out new ways to profit off it. This idea should be forgotten and we should move on to eliminating all centralized stablecoin PSMs.   Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 NO: RWA poses an existential threat to MakerDAO, DAI and MKR. I stand firmly opposed to any RWA deals and we should not be building more infrastructure to support them.   Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 ABSTAIN: There is not enough information in the proposal about what how this Chainlink Automation actually functions and, specifically, whether it is under the control of the Chainlink multisig. I will abstain rather than vote no since it\u2019s more out of uncertainty than opposition.   Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster (MIP55c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 NO: RWA poses an existential threat to MakerDAO, DAI and MKR. I stand firmly opposed to any RWA deals and we should not be building more infrastructure to support them.   Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023 NO: RWA poses an existential threat to MakerDAO, DAI and MKR. I stand firmly opposed to any RWA deals and we should not be building more infrastructure to support them.   Ratification Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 (MIP14c2-SP2) - January 9, 2023 YES: I\u2019m fine with funding Immunefi on a short-term basis. This shouldn\u2019t be treated as a CU. It should be treated as a contractor.   Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) - January 9, 2023 YES: I have no opposition to this short-term funding proposal for TechOps.   Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding (COM-001) (MIP39c3-SP7) - January 9, 2023 ABSTAIN: I\u2019ve said before that I think MakerDAO severance packages are out of control. $300k plus as a severance package for a CU member is outrageous. With that said, I am abstaining on this vote because I like David and I don\u2019t want to vote \u201cReject\u201d when he\u2019s involved.    Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 NO: The DAO should have a limit on the amount of funds that can be moved using this MIP. Especially in today\u2019s climate, where everyone seems to want a piece of the action. I do not support removing the ceiling.   Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 NO: Many of the earlier MIPs contained language that is important to remember why this DAO was formed in the first place. To avoid erasing history, rather than removing old MIPs entirely, they should be somehow archived and still visible and searchable.   Ratification Poll for MIP14 Repeal (MIP4c4-SP2) - January 9, 2023 NO: I don\u2019t see any reason to get rid of this MIP entirely unless there is a suitable replacement for its functionality.   Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 NO: Getting rid of this MIP will allow people to utilize December as a low-engagement month and a great time to get controversial votes passed. We should continue to keep December as a vote-free month (except in cases of emergency, of course).   Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 BOTH OK: Both of these tweaks are fine. Some delegates have been taking advantage of the Abstain vote and I think that this is a good way to counteract that behavior. Communicating lack of support for an Executive within 72 hours seems reasonable.   Adjust the Debt Floor (dust) - January 23, 2023 BROAD REDUCTION: The analysis in the forum post is very helpful and leads to the obvious conclusion that all proposed debt floors should be reduced in the proposed collateral types.   Offboarding Parameters for USDC-A, USDP-A, and GUSD-A - January 23, 2023 YES: Agreed that these vaults are now redundant with the PSMs taking over, however in reality, the right move is for the DAO to eliminate the PSMs. For now it makes the most sense to eliminate these vault types.   EXECUTIVE: MOMC Parameter Changes, GUSD PSM tout Decrease, CES MKR Transfer, Flash Mint Module Upgrade, Cage Aave D3M - January 27, 2023 I have moved my MKR to this Executive in support of the decisions made during the polling process and to support the security of MKR governance.

Update the Multisig Managing the Velodrome NFT - January 6, 2023 ABSTAIN: I do not support the use of multisigs by the DAO and voted against the creation of this multisig. At this point, I do not want to stand in the way of its management, even though this is a vote to reduce its security.   PPG - Open Market Committee Proposal - February 6, 2023 NO: Typically I support the recommendations of the OMCP, however this one includes the activation of Aave D3M. The Aave D3M poses an existential risk to MakerDAO and DAI due to Aave\u2019s reckless reliance on the security of Chainlink\u2019s multisig for its existence. If Chainlink\u2019s multisig were to be compromised, Aave could be destroyed. If this D3M is activated, then DAI would be destroyed along with it.   Dust Parameter Changes, Chainlink Automation Keeper Network Stream Setup, Recognized Delegate Compensation for January - February 8, 2023 I have moved my MKR to this Executive in support of the decisions made during the polling process and to support the security of MKR governance. Also, I am heavily incentivized to do so because my RD comp is bundled into this executive.   Ratification Poll for Restart a daily $100 Micro-Burn of MKR in Show of Good Faith to MKR Holders (MIP74c1-SP1) - February 13, 2023 YES: The MKR burn has been deactivated for far too long. This amount is way too small, but it\u2019s better than nothing. I personally don\u2019t believe that this is enough to show a good-faith effort by the DAO to restart the burn, but again, it\u2019s better than no burn at all.   ",
