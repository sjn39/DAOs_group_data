Can anyone here connect Jarrad to resources or individuals who are involved in social psychology and related fields, specifically qualitative interpretation of survey results? Context: @jarradhope posted this to the ethereum/governance channel:  @lrettig @jpitts and everyone else here. I would love to start herding the cats to do the interpretation phase of survey results, how we can can distill it down into a document, quantitative analysis is pretty straight forward, our ipynb can be found here https://github.com/status-im/datasets/tree/master/201805_EIP0_shared_values, but how to best go about qualitative interpretation and the process around it alludes me Some ideas are that participants can write separate Google docs as an intermediary layer, we comment on those then try distill those docs into a \u2018master\u2019 doc until it\u2019s revised We could introduce some structure, but we\u2019d have same coordination problems coming up with document structure itself In short, what do we think is the best way to create this shared values document?
