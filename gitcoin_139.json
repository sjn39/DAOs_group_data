By way of example, here is how you could think about the network effects of the Gitcoin entwork:  On average, every funder who joins Gitcoin adds more grant funding to every other grant in the network. On average, every grant who joins Gitcoin generates more value for each funder on the network.   Screen Shot 2022-06-20 at 7.59.29 PM768\u00d7630 66.1 KB  The value flow is rather circular here.    This is really powerful because as network effects are spun through this infinite loop, it enables exponential growth in the utility of the network.  5ae77475d1b2b98154f3467b_GeometricLinearGrowth-12727\u00d71879 37.6 KB   The Gitcoin Grants 2.0 Network Effects These network effects are what enable the Gitcoin Grants 2.0 flywheel  We enable Community/Ecosystem builders to get their JTBD (Build their ecosystem/community) done (and get feedback about which parts their community is worth funding). The way we do that is we enable Grant Owners to get their JTBD (raise $$$) done. (and get feedback about which things their community thinks is worth funding)  The way we do that is we enable Contributors to get their JTBD (find great projects, support them) done. (and give feedback about which things they think is worth funding)     The Gitcoin Passport Network Effects These network effects are what enable the Gitcoin passport are  More users using more dapps creates more utility (stamps). More stamps creates more utility(stamps/sybil resistence) for users/dapps that integrate passport. More dApps create more utility(stamps/sybil resistence) that attracts more users.   Why is this powerful?  Because once market networks start to get their network effects flowing, that creates much much more utility for the network. For the DAO to realize it\u2019s essential intent I advise that it may want to consider bootstrapping these network effects as much as possible.  One the exponential growth of network effects begin to really compound on itself, that is a very strong position for the DAO to be in. ",

If the people on a network produce the majority of value for other users, how do you get the first users to join?

Est. reading time: 7 minutes       A lot of them boil down to \"do things that dont scale to boostrap the network. For example, we could bootstrap the \u201cmore utility\u201d portion of the Gitcoin Passport product by adding more integrations.   We could bootstrap the \u201cmore users\u201d portion of the network by releasing toy use cases with token rewards in them (eg \u201cprove you have at least $100 worth of cost of forgery in Gitcoin Passport and get a 50 DAI reward\u201d).
