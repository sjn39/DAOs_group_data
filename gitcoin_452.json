The purpose of this Forum is not to ask how much everyone have in their wallet, not to ask money, and also not intended to ask for airdrop. (I like Airdrop by the way) A common goal is to get involved around Web3 projects, grants, funding and matching rounds, hacking bounties, sharing knowledge, making new friends: Meet, Learn, Earn, Repeat. I hope this will help you! You can have a look here at the current Hackathons List and register or try to find a team! Have a great day! ",
