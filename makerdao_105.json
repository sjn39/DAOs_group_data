                    "content": "As some of you know by now, I finally got an email from Senator Warren\u2019s office requesting a meeting on Monday. This is expected to be a fairly mid-level meeting with the senator\u2019s advisors on banking issues. It is, however, the first time I\u2019ve managed to get one of our critics to engage with us. Past meetings with senatorial and congressional members/staff have all been those who are at least \u201ccrypto curious.\u201d I do not expect fireworks from this meeting, but since it is such a rare opportunity for the crypto community at large to engage directly with Senator Warren\u2019s office, I did want to solicit (reasonable) questions and comments that may be worth bringing up. Those familiar with Warren\u2019s politics, feel free to chime in with ways that Maker specifically aligns with those. The main goal, however, is to further open the channels of communication. Typically these first conversations are extremely basic in explaining blockchain technology and Maker\u2019s business model. As a frame of reference, in the most recent testimony by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, Senator Warren questioned Chairman Gensler about transaction fees specifically on decentralized exchanges. His answer \u2013 which satisfied her \u2013 was that it was determined by user agreements. Not gas. Not dynamic pricing (I try to use Uber\u2019s \u201csurge pricing\u201d as an analogy many understand). User agreements. We have a long way to travel down the road of basic outreach and education, so please offer comments that are non-technical and succinct, if possible. As an aside, I am actively trying to put MakerDAO at the lead of a more conciliatory outreach effort than the mainstream lobbying groups and individuals \u2013 Coin Center, DeFi Education Fund, Ryan Selkis, Jake Chervinsky, etc. Their positions are worth staking out, but Maker is both better behaved and more responsibly run than the bulk of crypto. And to date, I think our own efforts have clearly borne more fruit as more and more requests from institutions and policymakers come in, wanting to learn more about crypto, now that they know not all of us bite. I would appreciate you sharing this post in other areas of the crypto community \u2013 other DAOs, social media channels like Discord, etc \u2013 so that 1) a broad array of input can be received to help prepare for what I hope will be getting our foot in the door to more meaningful discussions with our sharpest critics, and 2) to demonstrate to the crypto community that dialogue is possible, and Maker will need co-travelers on this less antagonistic path.

DAI is a promise by a borrower to pay back debt, and is fully backed by the borrowers deposited collateral and the system mechanics designed to maintain this  In this sense DAI is a contract between the borrower and the system based on the collateral deposited.    DAI is both a promise to repay debt but also this promise is fully backed up with collateral deposited with a value greater than the debt. DAI at all times is backed by the value of collateral - so even if a borrower never repays their debt the system will eventually auction their collateral and do it for them using their own assets. Should anything fall through MKR itself is the final pledge to DAI that its value is backed by something.  The system is fully liquid at all times.   Maker does not reloan collateral and a borrower can pay back their debt and free their collateral whenever they want Maker does not print DAI - borrowers do The status of the Maker system is fully transparent and on-chain.  AT ALL TIMES! No other stablecoin issuer is as transparent as Maker! Finally by design MKR token holders will never expect a dividend or return and so as far as anyone can tell fails the Howey test.  If there was one question I would ask it would be to see if you can get confirmation of whether in their view MKR does fail the Howey test.  In fact MKR holders know fully well they could be diluted at any time.    The only way a MKR holder gets a return is if they sell their MKR at a later date and there is not one guarantee this price will be higher than when they purchased it. All MKR holders have an opportunity to participate in all governance functions at all times. Beyond this - great job @PaperImperium I hope you at least make some notes of the conversation and brief MakerDAO after the fact. ",

I think all of these are important but go for the bigger issues. Equability - equal access for all.   DAI with a PEG value of 1 USD is bringing the dollar to the third world in unprecedented ways from the individual to the institution. Fairness - equal access means fairness to all. Transparency - there is not one project that is as transparent as Maker Over collateralized - there is not one stablecoin that is fully overcollateralized via collateral classes. Fully liquid at all times - collateral assets are never re-loaned and so fully accessible at all times by borrowers provided debt is repaid. DAI is PEGGED to the USD - giving USD a premier spot with a fully transparent decentralized stablecoin protocol like Maker. RWA and IV are important growth and focus aspects* that we are navigating but Maker is fully committed to the above key points. ",

By now, You probably know MakerDAO more than I do, and can explain it better. But when trying to explain to some friends what MakerDAO is in DeFI I had some success with the following 2 points:   MakerDAO is Pawnbroker, lending you money (at a variable interest rate) taking some collateral. The catch is, however, that here money is DAI, a cryptocurrency minted out of thin air by MakerDAO that is supposed to be at 1:1 with USD.   How does DAI stay 1:1 with USD then? A number of methods but basically as follows: if 1DAI<1USD then people will hurry to pay back their debts, because they can obtain the DAI borrowed at discounted price in the market: this buy pressure eventually push up the price, restoring the peg. If 1DAI>1USD,  people will be happy to make new DAI-loans, sell the DAI for other stablecoins (i.e., USD) and make therefore a profit, as long as 1DAI>1USD. This sell pressure eventually push down the price, restoring the peg.   In my experience, people immediately get the first point, and the smart ones are kind of dubious about the second regarding peg (rightly so). But at least they get what MakerDAO is under the assumption that (2) is indeed a working method for keeping the PEG (as it has historically proved to be, kinda). Plus, add that: MaderDAO, the DAO controlled collectively by MKR holders, controls:  the interest rates, what types of collateral to accept, what kind of platform to operate on (e.g., Ethereum, L2s, etc) etc etc  and that it is sufficient to buy MKR to have a say in MakerDAO.

Here would be my personal recommendations. 1. Don\u2019t get bogged down in technical details. Some commenters have suggested discussing layer 2 solutions like optimistic rollups or zk-rollups. In contract I believe this should be avoided unless your interlocutors specifically request details. Zero knowledge proofs, fraud proofs, time to finality, byzantine fault tolerance, etc: people deep into the crypto ecosystem often forget that these are highly non trivial concepts for non-tech savvy people. You\u2019re meeting with banking advisors, not computer scientists. Of course it might still be useful to explain that distributed ledgers like Ethereum are being made more scalable and environmentally friendly by a diverse, global community of contributors and no central actor, but there\u2019s no need to go into the weeds of it in a first approach. 2. Emphasize that you have a common goal: more transparency, more access, less shadow banking. Regulators have been quite biased so far, equating the entirety of the DeFi ecosystem with actual shadow banks like Tether, or decentralization theaters like DMM. Let them realize beyond any reasonable doubt that this is not representative of the entire ecosystem. Explain how Maker is actually decentralized with transparent governance, transparent system state, transparent execution etc. Give examples of systems like Uniswap that don\u2019t even have governance and that can be accessed by  anyone, and where no single actor, or group of actors that would easily collude are able to change the way these systems work. This should be contrasted with the opacity of the current financial system, including execution flow etc. Consider for example that in the case of on-chain decentralized finance, even if there might be front-running, it is transparent and easily detected; a win-win for users and regulators alike. As Mike Novogratz put it: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had a mortgage crisis in 2007 if we could have just looked on chain and seen Bear  Stearns\u2019s mortgage exposure\u201d. This might not be perfectly accurate, but this conveys a core idea of DeFi. 3. Prepare a short, quick demonstration of the user experience. In my experience discussing decentralized finance with outsiders, it all sounds a bit like mumbo jumbo until you actually show them what the experience is like. I believe S. Warren\u2019s banking advisors would be highly sensitive to a live demonstration of DAI minting, redeeming, and perhaps a simple trade on Uniswap if time permits. At a minimum, I would set up a wallet with enough ETH to be able to mint DAI using one the interfaces that allow to interact with Maker.  Open a CDP and add collateral to it. Mint DAI. Show the transactions on Etherscan to emphazie transparency and accessibility of data by third parties. Show a Dune Analytics dashboard for Maker. Emphasize that similar to Etherscan, Dune Analytics is not affiliated with Maker in any way = transparency and accessibility.  This can all be done under 5 minutes, and this demonstration will serve to demonstrate several concepts that should speak to these banking advisors much more than abstract claims, namely:  The ability to take out an instant collateralized loan without any gatekeeping and the robustness of algorithmic liquidations. The complete transparency of the process from start to finish. The ease of use.  This might also start a good conversation around the supposed risk of misuse by criminals or terrorists. These advisors will see firsthand that this can all be tracked in real time and that as such the idea of criminal misuse doesn\u2019t make much sense. All in all such a quick, live demonstration should be worth a thousand words. Hopefully with these talking points, they might realize that decentralized finance (done properly) is a weapon against the shadow banking Senator Warrent claims to fight rather than yet another shenanigan from scammers. Let me know what you think! ",

Warren,  I want to caution against getting us drawn in with \u201clending\u201d platforms like Compound,  Aave,  etc. Not only is the activity that occurs on the Maker Protocol fundamentally different than those two protocols and other lending/borrowing platforms, Sen. Warren\u2019s close ally,  Gary Gensler, has made clear his intention to pursue the lenders/borrowers of our space. Why paint a bigger target on our back by erroneously describing Maker as a lending platform if we don\u2019t have to?  By doing so, we give credence to the regulatory authorities who may see us as more of a target. To be clear, the DAO presently does not \u201clend\u201d anything and the activity that users engage in with the Maker Protocol (with a non-cuatodial,  user created stablecoin) is not what one traditionally considers \u201clending\u201d. I don\u2019t mean to beat a dead horse here and I apologize if my tone comes across as such but we REALLY need to be careful how we describe the Maker Protocol and the activity it permits. ",

For my two cents, you will need to effectively convey the benefits of a blockchain based system over traditional financial rails and infrastructure. I believe you may be capturing this in the customer experience talking point, but I think it needs to go further as this has easy counterpoints on its own (would the same customer experience be possible on traditional rails with some policy changes? Why not just pursue the policy changes then versus supporting Maker and other DeFi initiatives?). To me, this means highlighting the fundamental opportunities present at an infrastructure level. Improved transparency, improved functionality via smart-contracts, lower costs of access and participation, efficiency gains from an open and interoperable digital platforms, etc. Of course, doing all of this at a high-level without getting bogged down by the technical complexities and without detracting from your other points! No big deal though right\u2026 ",
