As you probably know, V3 is planned to release first on L1, and later to implement L2. So it\u2019s not currently planned to be scalable from day 1. Now the problem is that if V3 is really awesome, and they release it now, Binance will copy it. Users will still be heavily limited by the cost of transaction on Ethereum, and if V3 is great (which I think it will be), users might decide to sacrifice decentralization in order to be able to afford to use it. They\u2019ll end up on the Binance chain using \u201cPancakeswap V3\u201d, and Uniswap V3 could greatly benefit Binance instead of Ethereum (where most won\u2019t be able to afford to use it).

Not only gas fees, but transaction speed is something ETH has never been able to match. There\u2019s already a fully competing suite of DApps on BSC, however BSC does not attempt to compete at all, as they have a built in bridge feature that allows you to seamlessly transfer assets across chains back and forth. While Uniswap should be running on BSC (if this is something that we as a community want to do, I can help. I\u2019ve already migrated a number of DApps to BSC. This would be optimal, as it gives users the choice to use Uniswap on either chain. The thing about BSC is that it makes no claim to be a successor to Ethereum, it is a complement. They went through the trouble to create a very easy to use bridging system to move assets, LP shares, and other tokens between chains almost instantly. If Uniswap has anything in store, I hope it\u2019s launching dual-chain on Ethereum & BSC, because BSC is absolutely not afraid of Uniswap, and why should it be? SUSHI proved that a clone could generate as much use and even match the price and market cap of Uniswap. BSC is working on chain interoperability and they\u2019re doing an amazing job at it at a pace that is blistering. Sincerely hope that Uniswap goes multi-chain, it\u2019s not difficult to do (I\u2019ve migrated a few apps to BSC already and the process is straightforward). I already have most of my UNI and Uniswap LP tokens migrated over to BSC anyway so I can actually do something with them without spending $70/transaction. When it\u2019s reasonable to do so on Ethereum, I\u2019ll migrate back, but in the meantime I\u2019m happy getting incentivized farms on multiple chains.     Buckerino:  For now, most of the Pancakeswap liquidity and volume comes from the BNB/wBNB pair so its not a real problem YET, but we have to have a serious conversation about what Uniswap has in store in order to counter it   That\u2019s just pancake swap. With ETH and UNI both migrated to BSC, there\u2019s liquidity on Beefy.finance, AutoSwap, etc. All of these are incentivized at the moment and for the end-user (me), it makes no sense to keep my assets on Ethereum when I can bridge them to BSC in bulk for a low cost and interact with and update my positions in a matter of seconds with an average transaction fee of $0.23 Personally, I haven\u2019t touched Ethereum since late November. I\u2019ve migrated most of my assets over to BSC, including UNI, SUSHI, and my LP tokens. It makes no sense to have them collect dust on Ethereum when I can actively manage them on BSC. That\u2019s nothing against Uniswap, it is just the nature of the game. The rate that apps have been popping up on BSC is blistering, and I\u2019ve already rebuilt most of my liquidity pools including ETH-UNI LP on BSC with much higher returns, a bigger percentage of the pool, plus the benefit of incentivized $CAKE and $AUTO harvesting. Uniswap has one option: Cross chain compatability. Again, if this is something the community decides on I\u2019m more than happy to help update the code-base to make it happen. ",

Also, @Hindel, to your two points:  Binance requests a fee because they are the facilitator of the bridge. There\u2019s no free lunch in crypto. Since The Ethereum Foundation didn\u2019t put any effort into bridging and Binance runs the entire thing on their network, it only makes sense that both incoming and outgoing events would be profitable to the network. This happened at a moment when Ethereum users had been dealing with ridiculous fees for months, to the point where unless you\u2019re moving thousands of USD at a time you\u2019re not profiting on any transaction. Talk about a vector for centralized forces to take over the network\u2026 There\u2019s a new player in town and they\u2019ve been bootstrapping the full suite of DeFi protocols on their normal custodial platform for over a year. Between Trust Wallet Token release, slow ETH transactions, and fully developed DApps going live very fast on BSC people are trying out something new. Can you blame them? It\u2019s happening right now because Binance has had a very detailed roadmap and has stuck to it, it could have failed, but at the end of the day there is an exodus of people going from Ethereum to trying out BSC. Users comfortable with multi-chain interaction is GREAT for crypto! And the same thing will happen when other smart contract/EVM compatible chains emerge, people will want to try it. Uniswap needs to be ready for the inevitable fact that Ethereum is no longer the only player in DeFi and the total locked value will soon be distributed across multiple chains. Either get the system ready and operating in a multi-chain environment or continue to fall behind. We\u2019re already behind Pancakeswap in TLV and AUTO & Beefy.finance are coming in hot.  By the way, ETH 2.0 is moving towards major consensus taking place among a relatively small subset of validator nodes backed up by full nodes. BSC does not solely rely on the validator nodes, I personally run an accelerator node for BSC, and just like ETH has in store, after consensus takes place among validators, the signing full nodes verify that they are all in agreement and that the runtime environment is in agreement with the source code. At the end of the day, the strongest projects in crypto that achieved network effect were all bootstrapped by a centralized party for some time before going fully decentralized. Expecting a purpose-driven EVM-compatible chain with the existing liquidity, protocols, and assets in storage of the scope of BSC to dive head first into full decentralization is nutty. There is a such thing as too many hands in the pot. Hate them of love them, CZ & Binance have onboarded more people to crypto around the world than almost any other person/organization. If the validator nodes didn\u2019t have to run the open-source code including the rules which govern what a validator can and cannot do perhaps I would be concerned. It\u2019s real easy to be ignorant and not explore the code base on this one and just play the \u201cscrew CZ & Binance card\u201d but you\u2019re doing a disservice by shunning a pretty impressive platform, they\u2019re onto something that may be niche, but is good for crypto. Just some thoughts from a contributor to over a dozen blockchain networks and from a life lived watching internet companies and protocols rise and fall over the last 30 years in my role as a software and network engineer. You can be salty, you can not like BSC, but it\u2019s evolve or die. This space moves fast, clearly faster than the community governance can keep up with (one more thing to be said about a non-decentralized core team doing the bootstrapping of upgrades and additions before global release).

Again, since BSC is the only facilitator of the bridge feature and it wasn\u2019t a co-op between The Ethereum Foundation/Developers and them, they can take transaction fees on assets coming in and out, that\u2019s their right as the network running the bridge.

Interesting that this is your thought today when less than 6 months ago you wrote that DeFi \u201cis about providing a means to transact assets without a third party.\u201d (Source) So why would you now choose the chain on which a third party is at the core of everything, from nodes to liquidity?

I have the same thoughts on DeFi, however as a pragmatic software engineer and capitalist, competition is still at the core of this. Fortunately blockchain has seen less cutthroat competition and more collaboration. While the ultimate goal is decentralization, the average person with no technical experience simply will not be able to comfortably jump into a fully decentralized and crowdsource-coded platform, we\u2019re still at the awkward phase where we need good on-ramps, which require liquidity, backing, and support. You\u2019ve also ommitted the comments I\u2019ve made where I\u2019ve said that I want a better solution to BSC. Frankly, if you don\u2019t like that BSC is taking market share, make a proposal. We could easily use the UNI pool to fund developers to fork an EVM chain where UNI is the base token, allowing for Uniswap functions to take place with low fees, then immediately be bridged back to Ethereum. I also don\u2019t see any work being done on the code base in preparation for UNI running as a sharded Dapp or an ETH Validator Node once 2.0 comes out. I\u2019m not shilling CZ or Binance by saying that they have a fantastic UI, transaction speeds, and low costs, that\u2019s just a fact. If ETH cuts into my profits, but I have another option that lets me continue the same level of passive income, I\u2019ll take it, knowing that as the space matures I will be able to \u201chave my cake and eat it too\u201d when it comes to ease-of-use and cost. I\u2019m not changing my stance that DeFi will eventually be P2P, decentralized, and fully open-source. However it\u2019s the responsibility of the party that feels like they\u2019re being slighted to do something about it. I see a lot of complaining, and not many solutions. If it\u2019s that big of a problem, let\u2019s come up with a game plan everyone. I\u2019ve stated multiple times that I\u2019m willing to offer my knowledge with building chains, bridges, networks, and DApps should the community wish. It\u2019s an open invitation, I\u2019d rather not use BSC, but it\u2019s the fastest most liquid option at the moment. ",

It\u2019s a brilliant and simple mechanism for everything from governance, to prediction markets, to games. I\u2019ve had quite a lot of fun applying variations token and other models to the Unipig code.     ianaz:  Is this a paid post by Binance?   Is this the first bubble you\u2019ve been through? Did you think the path to decentralization would be smooth and without compromise? That\u2019s not how it works. Look at every lasting project from the ICO bubble, Bitcoin, Ethereum, even UniSwap, they all started out with a core team that bootstrapped the software and ran it themselves for a while and worked the bugs out before releasing it to the public, or waiting for a network effect to take over. We\u2019re going to have more centralized systems and less centralized systems, but they\u2019re all going to coexist together regardless of how you feel about it. Especially in FOSS, if you don\u2019t do it, someone else will do it and you won\u2019t get a say in how that one is done. Hell, even Satoshi mined the first million or so blocks of BTC. It didn\u2019t stop everyone else from benefiting, if anything it helped out. Granted now we\u2019re talking about the pathways of communication, the blockchains themselves, but the same thing has to happen. There\u2019s going to be some decentralized chains that have a huge network effect but they\u2019re still working out the bugs. There\u2019s going to be some privately controlled or very centralized chains that offer great services at a cheaper cost, but maybe at a compromise of centralization or privacy. They can coexist, and it\u2019s good that they can. You don\u2019t want all your eggs in one basket this early in the process. The centralization has also helped provide extremely rapid development as well as a huge free library on blockchain technology, onboarding outreach, and data-driver research on tokens. Industry has always been able to get things done faster than the government, that\u2019s going to take some time and work to iron out now that they\u2019re one-in-the-same. There\u2019s always going to be a compromise somewhere in life, that\u2019s no reason to dismiss any alternative that **your project ** (you\u2019re here which means this is yours too) could run on as an alternative in case of emergency, or even flourish due to new exposure. Uniswap should have been ported to BSC as soon as it was released because it\u2019s basically copy and paste. It should have been up on NEO before Flamingo even finished farming their tokens. Uniswap should have been converting the code so the app could run on ALGO and Cardano. I\u2019ve forked UniSwap and am currently working on the two chains to make future integration easier should we decide to do so. We need to do so. If new users come on from other chains, that\u2019s only going to increase the TLV of the system, we can figure out how to onboard new users with $UNI without diluting it. But dismissing BSC is like a software language refusing to operate on Mac out of some principle, this isn\u2019t a shill for any one chain, I\u2019m pointing out what most people don\u2019t realize: it\u2019s bigger than Ethereum vs. BSC. Eventually, we\u2019re going to be fluidly moving our personal value and assets in the form of utility tokens with real-world applications through various blockchains to facilitate an incredible amount of processes. At the intersection of the \u201cValue Store\u201d coins (BTC, ETH, BNB\u2026) and Utility Tokens lies Uniswap. It\u2019s the exchange machine that lets you put your assets into it, let them work for you or provide you services, and then transfer them back into your store of value. That niche will be the clearing house for the next industrial revolution and since competition isn\u2019t going anywhere, in the next decade there\u2019s going to be a few \u201cpillar\u201d projects that fill this niche that have a TLV with more zeroes than you\u2019ve ever seen before. @pesho, I don\u2019t write these long posts because I love CZ, or because I have any personal feeling on one chain versus another at this point, the space is too young to take sides. I spend the time to write long posts because I think it\u2019s important to look at the nuance of a situation for a change instead of just reacting and dismissing anything that seems threatening. The lasting projects aren\u2019t going to be the ones that are worried about what\u2019s happening next quarter or next upgrade, they\u2019re the ones worried about what\u2019s going to happen in 5 years from now. We can stay ahead of the curve, we need to stay ahead of the curve. What Uniswap does regarding fluid use across multiple chains is bigger than what you or I think of CZ, Binance, or ETH, it\u2019s the difference between providing an integral service to humanity and industry or forever becoming a relic in the Ethereum blockchain, with a last transaction getting buried under millions of future blocks.

I think this happens to be the exact reason why Uniswap doesn\u2019t care about BSC. Uniswap doesn\u2019t worry about the current congestion in the Ethereum network, because it seems extremely likely to be solved within a few months tops. BSC is a low quality quick fix for a project like Uniswap. A Chinese-owned centralized chain run by a company that can\u2019t even allow US users is nothing but a quick money grab. They might bill themselves \u201cblockchain\u201d and \u201cdefi\u201d, but without decentralization such projects are nothing but overly complicated databases. Uniswap on a centralized chain would provide nothing more than Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance already provide. Uniswap on Ethereum is currently the only way to attain the only thing blockchain is truly about: decentralization. It seems to me like your values and motivations have separated from Ethereum\u2019s and Uniswap\u2019s. Decentralization isn\u2019t a \u201cnice to have\u201d.

Hindel:  They might bill themselves \u201cblockchain\u201d and \u201cdefi\u201d, but without decentralization such projects are nothing but overly complicated databases.   No quotes needed, it\u2019s a blockchain by definition, and DeFi (also by definition). A distributed computational network is hardly just an overly complicated database.     Hindel:  Uniswap on Ethereum is currently the only way to attain the only thing blockchain is truly about: decentralization.   So short sighted. Ethereum is not the most decentralized chain. It\u2019s just the largest by market cap. What do you think happens when ETH2 rolls out and they\u2019re using validator nodes with a high cost of entry? Is that distributed enough for you when your average person can\u2019t go out and run a full node and take all advantage of the full network features? You can be a validator and get the base transactional layer for a cool, easy $50,000. At least Binance and Algorand tells you up front how much everything costs and have detailed EULAs.     Hindel:  It seems to me like your values and motivations have separated from Ethereum\u2019s and Uniswap\u2019s.   You\u2019re painting a black and white picture when in reality, as things come to fruition, there will be many shades of grey, with varying amounts of decentralization. You can say:     Hindel:  Decentralization isn\u2019t a \u201cnice to have\u201d. Decentralization is what it\u2019s all about.   But guess what, this is brand new. There\u2019s no data to back that up, and no way you could make a judgement call on my values, I\u2019m a FOSS blockchain developer, If I cared about centralization I\u2019d save myself the headache and take an executive job with AWS but I love what a decentralized future holds. But, I\u2019m not so naive to think that everything in the future will be decentralized or that Ethereum will rule DeFi. Also, don\u2019t confuse decentralized with distributed. Sure, ETH is more distributed, I guess\u2026 it depends on what metric. Sparkpool controls 25% of the hashpower of Ethereum. Is that decentralized? Well, It\u2019s half way to a 51% attack so I\u2019ll let you decide for yourself if the glass is really half full or half empty; Two pools coordinate, and a single entity with enough capital comes into Sparkpool and the fact that they already have the numbers means trouble. It\u2019s less decentralized than < 25 validator nodes with a max 4% network each? Not even that. Does it have nodes spread out globally. Sure, BSC is run by CZ and his \u201ccronies\u201d, ETH is run by a handful of dev groups, The Foundation, and their \u201ccronies\u201d, just like all the other chains are run by the creators and their cronies. Don\u2019t let the open governance of DApps and DAOs confuse you into thinking that the underlying chain is a utopia, ETH still has controlling interests who maintain a good portion of the network. I love Ethereum, but seriously look at the big picture. If UNI pretends like Ethereum is the end-all for DeFi, we\u2019ve got another thing coming, because that is 100% not going to be the case. We can cater to what could possibly be a niche chain (I know it\u2019s blasphamous to say, but it\u2019s 100% possible given historical software development\u2026 1st doesn\u2019t always mean best.) I\u2019m assuring you with 20+ years of seeing companies come and go, of developing network protocols, apps, and everything in between. If Uniswap doesn\u2019t accept and take advantage of the fact that the future will be people switching between chains based on their needs, they\u2019re giving up the position of \u201cValue Store\u201d and \u201cUtility Distributor\u201d to another project that I guarantee will be compatible on all smart-contract enabled chains. I\u2019m not suggesting splitting UNI 50/50 between Ethereum and BSC, but in the decade we\u2019ll likely have 3-4 main, stable, saleable computational blockchains that people switch between based on what each one offers. Competition isn\u2019t going anywhere, it\u2019s getting bigger and it\u2019s going from DApps to entire chains. Except BSC is playing the long game that Uniswap is unwilling to play, they\u2019re enticing people by launching ready to go with a suite of DApps that can milk from Ethereum as long as they can. You want us to keep getting our TLV on Ethereum sucked up by other chains or would you rather do something about it and hedge against that by beating them at their own game. They can\u2019t run Uniswap out of business if Uniswap is on every smart chain because that is true decentralization; not how many nodes one chain has vs another or whether they use PoS or PoA. If you can\u2019t see where this whole space is going after everything we\u2019ve talked about I\u2019m sorry, and very grateful that you don\u2019t have a controlling vote in UNI Gov. ",

You\u2019ll comment all day on anything I say negative about ETH but why not address all the valid points I brought up? Is it because I am in fact correct? Yes! 20 years in the business and you learn a thing or two. The first is that unless you\u2019ve been deep in software design, you have no idea how quickly something like BSC can dominate the market if they want. If you dislike BSC, even more reason to be on their system. Know how they work, take advice from their protocols, collect data, use it to make Ethereum better. Know your enemy. If you want to take my experience as condescending, that\u2019s on you, you\u2019ve added nothing to this conversation except for baseless objections. I\u2019m under no obligation to take your capacity for offense into account when I\u2019m simply trying to explain how software stacks and system agnostic vs. dogmatic programs generally turn out. I\u2019ve spent most of your life doing development and network building, I\u2019ve earned the right to say matter-of-fact things, because I am an expert. If you can\u2019t take an experts advice, at least listen to it and consider it then you\u2019re lost. I\u2019m explaining how software cycles work. I\u2019m not degrading anyone, not dismissing anything, just telling you how it works time and time again. You don\u2019t have to like the game, but you 100% have to play it if you\u2019re going to stay around. Once the opportunity presents itself, then you\u2019re spread across multiple chains, you have say all of a sudden in more than once place. How on earth can we compete with PancakeSwap if we\u2019re not even on the same network\u2026 Have you seen the relative dominance increases in ETH vs. BSC? Have you seen the TLV spreading out to other chains? USDT is on 5 chains now, do you think one day it\u2019s just going to snap back to Ethereum only? No, that would be insane. If you stay on Ethereum only, you also get no say or influence in any other chain, quite possibly the most important thing you can have. Don\u2019t like how centralized BSC is? Port Uniswap, split the value between chains, and de-incentivize BSC users, you can\u2019t do anything from the sidelines though. DApps can eclipse you, make new protocols, do whatever they want, and you\u2019ll be none the wiser because you\u2019re so narrow sighted that all you see is ETH Dominance. I\u2019m sorry, I tried to help. I offered my time to build a bridge just for Uniswap, to port the code to literally any chain and help with the tokenomics as new TLV comes in because I have experience doing so in a safe manner, but don\u2019t mention that when you\u2019re responding. The UNI airdrop made me rethink how money and value will work, the UNI governance made me realize most people are not ready to govern themselves because they think they know everything. Learn the hard way, once you see how network effects knock out the least convenient options maybe then you\u2019d like to have a discussion like two adults. ",

Now that they have a base of knowledge I can show them decentralized Solutions, as I said in a previous post, it\u2019s important for teams to bootstrap programs, it\u2019s important for communities to push the needle towards decentralization. BSC dominance has been on the rise for what, a month, and people are acting like they\u2019re going to lock all the value in DeFi on their chain and never let anyone take it off. There\u2019s so many better, truly decentralized smart chains emerging right now. The only threat to Uniswap is not keeping up with the switch from separate chains to a network of blockchains. ",

Let\u2019s discuss the new proposal for Uniswap v3 and BNB Chain:    Deploy Uniswap v3 (1 / 0.3 / 0.05 / 0.01) to BNB Chain (Binance) Proposal Discussion   0xPlasma Labs and I have been big supporters and contributors to Uniswap ecosystem developments since v1 and all L1 and L2 blockchain ecosystems. Today I would like to raise a very important question that does not leave my thoughts and hear every person\u2019s opinion from the community.  The Uniswap ecosystem is crucial in developing the global decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. However, it has not yet deployed its protocol to the second-largest blockchain infrastructure by volume and user base\u2026     ",

In the voting, LayerZero came in second place after receiving recent criticism for security issues that went unnoticed. To become the official governance bridge for Uniswap, the largest decentralised exchange platform by trading volume, when its version 3 platform launches on Binance\u2019s BNB Chain, Wormhole, the cryptocurrency bridge platform, won a community vote on Tuesday. The win grants Wormhole valuable new turf in an ongoing battle between bridge platforms \u2013 vital pieces of crypto infrastructure that allow users to pass assets and other data between blockchains. So what happened today as the on-chain vote went live? A16z immediately rejected the entire Uni to BNB Chain deployment proposal simply because their bridge of choice, LayerZero, lost to Wormhole. The deployment of the cross-chain bridge, which is the source of the conflict. The proposed interoperability protocol is LayerZero, while a16z supports the use of the Wormhole bridge. Eddy Lazzarin, head of engineering at a16z, commented in the proposal discussion on Jan. 31: \u201cTo be totally unambiguous, we at a16z would have voted 15m tokens toward LayerZero if we were technically able to. And we will be able in future Snapshot votes. So, for the purposes of a \u201ctemperature check\u201d, please count us this way.\u201d What next? The vote is still ongoing. The tides must turn during the next 5 days. These discussions will raise a lot of questions about the future of DAO political structures and cross-chain messaging, to say the least. If all these debates settles and votes are favorable to launch its third iteration of its decentralised exchange on BNB Chain than the Uniswap price might brush its potential high of $13.69 as per coinpedia. Let me know is there anything I missed ? Please add your comments to discuss this. ",
