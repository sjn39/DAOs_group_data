Background Ethereum is planning to merge the proof of stake (POS) validation mechanism with the execution layer and eliminate proof of work (POW) mining. This upgrade from POW to POS is the result of years of development effort and has strong support throughout the Ethereum and defi community. Technical execution risks are considered to be acceptably low, and assuming the final Goerli testnet merge goes well the mainnet merge could take place as soon as September.   twitter.com    Galois Capital @Galois_Capital  Acknowledge that ETH1 can have value and try to work together to reach a minimally damaging situation.  Supression didn't work for ETC, but you may think it can work here because forking state is difficult.  Also EF and RHG have less dumping power than back then.   12:22 PM - 2 Aug 2022           18              twitter.com    ETHPoW @EthereumPoW  BREAKING: Poloniex will be the FIRST exchange to support EthereumPoW (ETHW). @Poloniex @justinsuntron  1/n https://t.co/h6M9Pxv5lZ   12:41 AM - 3 Aug 2022           130                43            Recently, there has been increasing focus by some crypto participants about potential POW Ethereum forks (that do not upgrade to POS validation). While many chain forks have taken place in the past, most notably Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash, the prevalence of centralized stablecoins, defi, and cross chain bridges in the Ethereum ecosystem make the prospect of forking much more complicated now. Despite these challenges, OG Ethereum miner Chandler Guo seems to be actively rallying efforts for a fork.   twitter.com    Chandler Guo @ChandlerGuo  fork it one more time twitter.com/PascalVanHecke\u2026   Pascal Van Hecke @PascalVanHecke  No hard fork can separate people! @ChandlerGuo @danielcawrey #eth #etc @ethereumproject @eth_classic #devcon2 #ethereum https://t.co/octX946BCV    8:06 PM - 27 Jul 2022           41                8            This post runs through potential outcomes and impacts of the merge and a potential POS vs POW fork.  Risk and Market Impact Overview This post focused on the following potential risks and market changes that could impact MakerDAO\u2019s operations:  Futures backwardation and negative funding stETH discount External asset fork choice Liquidity pool protocols Oracle networks and indexes Network downtime Replay attacks   Futures Backwardation and Negative Funding Spot holdings of ETH would receive any POW forked tokens, while exposure to ETH quarterly futures or perpetual contracts would not. Assuming efficient markets, this means that quarterly futures after the expected merge date should begin to trade at an additional discount with respect to ETH, based on the expected value of POW fork tokens.   twitter.com    Roshun Patel @roshunpatel  dec flipping into backwardation on eth starting to price in fork odds. Back in 2020 the play with the bchabc fork was buy spot and short the quarts https://t.co/Oyde1htnz8   7:56 PM - 31 Jul 2022           140                14            Recently, we\u2019ve seen the December 2022 quarterlies flip from premium to backwardation, which reflects the possibility of a POW fork accruing some saleable value. In practice, market participants can purchase spot ETH and then sell an equivalent amount of ETH futures to wager on fork value while remaining delta neutral. As the expected date of the merge draws closer, we may see some similar activity on perpetual contracts, with significant discount and negative funding reflecting the expected value of POW forked Ether.   twitter.com    GCR, Ezekiel X @GCRClassic  'Buy spot ETH, short futures' trade is so overcrowded, it will unleash nuclear selling pressure on the EthPOW fork   Funds with healthy 9+ fig positions in this, and will take the 'free' arb [if they can even cover the cost of slippage/backwardation] with no desire to hold Eth1   11:29 AM - 1 Aug 2022           1.5K                130            Considering the amount of capital pursuing this trade from a delta neutral perspective, this may lead to significant selling pressure on any POW forks immediately after launch. Alternatively if the prospect of POW fork declines, we may see the value of futures contracts increase back towards parity with spot. Impacts for Maker:  Nominal cost of leverage through futures contracts (excluding potential fork value) declines, creating competitive pressure vs Maker vaults Users who consider market implied fork value to be too high are incentivized to leverage on futures, while those considering implied value too low may prefer leveraging with Maker vaults (where the vault owner will still receive any potential fork tokens)  Responses:  Maintain competitive rates to avoid losing too much volume to futures contracts   stETH Discount stETH and other liquid staking assets are likely to become worthless on any POW Ethereum fork. This is because further chain upgrades would be required to unlock staked ETH from the deposit contract, and there is arguably little economic incentive for the fork chain to accommodate this (staked ETH holders are potentially less aligned with a POW chain fork). See recent Bitmex blog post for further discussion. \u200b\u200bhttps://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1554041641467613184?s=20&t=sdCjFfA3jReT1byktJZlyA As a result, the market price of liquid staking assets may decline based on the expected value of a POW forked ETH. This could occur from direct sales of stETH for ETH, or leveraged short positions (eg. on Euler Finance). If the expected value of a POW fork is high, this could lead to significant illiquidity risks for stETH as most decentralized exchange TVL is held within stableswap pools that concentrate liquidity around 1:1 price ratio with ETH. An increasing stETH discount could incentivize leveraged staking activity among those with low expectation of POW fork value, which would tend to raise ETH deposit rates on lending protocols while further increasing liquidity tail risks. Impacts for Maker:  Possible increase in stETH liquidity risk and downside volatility stETH discount could incentivize leveraged staking behavior, which would increase risk of negative price gaps while raising ETH supply rates on lending protocols  Responses:  Monitor stETH liquidity and respond with parameter changes (increasing stability fee or liquidation ratio) if necessary Monitor competitive rates using ETH collateral across defi lending protocols   External Asset Fork Choice Ethereum hosts a broad variety of externally backed assets. This includes cross chain bridges, centralized stablecoins, and real world assets (RWAs). Because these assets are backed by extrinsic collateral (either held off chain or on another chain), they can only be fully collateralized on a single chain at a time and the issuers will generally need to recognize one chain as canonical during a fork. The merge upgrade has strong support across the Ethereum community, defi users, and protocols, which should help ensure that fork choice is unanimously in favor of mainnet (POS) Ethereum. However, there is some level of risk that one or more external asset issuers could recognize a POW fork, motivated by financial exposure to miners or other reasons. This could render relevant assets bridged into mainnet Ethereum worthless (they would only be backed on the POW fork), while assets bridged out of Ethereum would be backed on the POW chain so would also face significant risk of becoming worthless. Tether in particular has been raised as a possible risk, due to potential financial ties with miners. While most decentralized stablecoins and lending protocols do not support USDT as collateral, Tether is still broadly integrated across exchanges. However, Tether has indicated support of the merge so this possibility is unlikely.   twitter.com    Paolo Ardoino \ud83d\udd73\ud83e\udd4a @paoloardoino  @lawmaster @EdwardWilll Support of ETH2 will be seamless.   8:56 PM - 29 Jul 2022           150                15            Impacts for Maker:  Minimal impact if all externally backed asset issuers support merge upgrade If one or more issuer supports POW fork, this could cause significant impact to DEX liquidity pools and other protocols accepting the asset as collateral  Responses:  Confirm merge support from key external asset providers that interact with Maker protocol, including: Circle, Paxos, Binance, Bitgo, Gemini, Centrifuge issuers, other RWA issuers, and services bridging DAI out to other chains (eg. Wormhole, Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Multichain)   Liquidity Pool Protocols Maker does not make user collateral available to be borrowed, while many other lending protocols including Aave, Compound, and Euler do. In the aftermath of a POW fork, a significant subset of assets on the fork chain (including stablecoins and bridged assets) would become worthless instantly. This could cause insolvency in pooled lending markets, and incentivize users to borrow all available ETH in the market (as the one asset most likely to retain some value in a fork). To the extent that users believe the POW Ether will retain some significant amount of value, they should tend to prefer vault style lending mechanisms instead of liquidity pools (where they are unlikely to be able to recover / withdraw their POW fork ETH due to insolvency). Withdrawals of ETH from liquidity protocols, particularly Aave and Euler, could cause a spike in ETH borrowing costs that would put pressure on leveraged stETH positions and potentially impact the price parity with ETH. Similar concerns exist for decentralized exchange protocols. The vast majority of non-ETH tokens would become worthless on a POW chain, causing DEX LPs to lose any potential value from fork-ETH held in liquidity pools. If users expect fork chain(s) to trade at significant value this could incentivize users to pull liquidity near the merge. Impacts for Maker:  Possible migration of some users from external lending protocols to Maker vaults Possible withdrawals of ETH from lending protocols putting pressure on stETH Near the merge, potential for decline in decentralized exchange liquidity for ETH pairings  Responses:  Monitor user behavior and maintain competitive rates to facilitate any potential migrations or user acquisition Monitor stETH leverage positions and ETH lending utilization on Aave, Euler Monitor exchange liquidity and consider parameter changes if needed   Oracle Networks and Indices Maker and other oracle networks like Chainlink are planning to support the merge and consider mainnet (POS) Ethereum as the canonical chain. However, the possibility of a POW fork complicates this somewhat, with heightened possibility of faulty data due to potential centralized exchange issues or ticker collisions. This could potentially impact price feeds for defi protocols, as well as price indices used to determine funding payments on perpetual contracts. For example, if a key exchange lists POW forked Ether without appropriate ticker or api changes, it could result in fork price being delivered instead of mainnet ETH. This has the potential to cause a wave of long liquidations, forced selling, and massive funding rate increases. Additionally, users of oracle data on the fork chain may be served mainnet data which could cause further issues and insolvency in defi protocols on the fork chain. As an example, Chainlink feeds would likely continue to reference mainnet ETH and other asset prices, even for transactions that are replayed on the fork. Any apps that rely on accurate pricing data on the fork chain would suffer from immediate losses. Impacts for Maker:  Increased possibility of bad / outlier data delivered to oracle feeds Possibility of market disruption due to bad price data incorporated in 3rd party oracles or perp indices  Responses:  Confirm centralized exchange plans with respect to POW fork listing, tickers, and API changes Encourage industry players to adopt alternative ticker for any POW fork, avoid collisions, and ensure continuity of mainnet Ethereum data   Network Downtime The merge is arguably the largest upgrade in Ethereum\u2019s history. With this significant protocol change, comes increased risk of technical faults that could potentially cause liveness failures and unavailability. If Ethereum goes down for a period of time, defi protocols like Maker could experience price gaps (discontinuous price drops) in collateral assets that could push vaults into liquidation or even insolvency. The risk of downtime or liveness failures is considered low, but is surely higher than during standard Ethereum operations. Further, even if the network remains available certain service providers or custodians could still face downtime. This could interfere with market liquidity conditions or users\u2019 ability to interact with the Maker protocol (eg minting / redemption of centralized stablecoins, exchange trading or deposits / withdrawals, RPC nodes, etc). Impacts for Maker:  Increased risk of downtime and liveness faults around time of the POS merge Possibility of negative price gaps during any network downtime Reduced ability for users to deleverage or defend their vault positions  Responses:  Consider parameter changes to increase margin of safety on vault positions (eg raising liquidation ratios, increasing stability fees on higher leverage vault types) Encourage users to increase their own margin of safety against liquidations in the lead up to merge upgrade   Replay Attacks Ethereum users (and even custody or infrastructure providers) may fall victim to so-called \u201creplay attacks\u201d in the aftermath of a POW Ethereum fork. Replay attacks allow for a transaction or message signed on one chain to be \u201creplayed\u201d on another chain in certain cases. This is discussed by Certik here. While EIP-155 offers a simple protection against transaction replaying by adding chain id as a transaction signature parameter, there is no guarantee that a POW fork would adopt a different chain-id from Ethereum mainnet (chain-id 1). If the chain ID was the same, this means transactions intended for Ethereum mainnet or POW fork could be replayed on the other chain (unless the transaction nonces do not align). Impacts for Maker:  Increased possibility of unintended transactions on mainnet, replayed from POW fork chain (eg closing vault positions, selling fork-DAI or fork-MKR tokens, etc) Possibility of mainnet transactions, including Maker oracle and keeper operations, being replayed to POW fork chain  Responses:  Share info about replay attack risk within Maker community Advocate for POW fork to use alternative chain-id (instead of chain-id 1 which will continue to be used by mainnet Ethereum) to avoid replaying transactions   Merge Scenario Example The expected market value of a POW fork can be roughly estimated based on discounts on ETH futures and liquid staked ETH derivatives. Currently the expected value based on these metrics seems to be low, with less than 1% movement since discussion of ETH forks gained prominence. Assume that the market expected value of POW fork ETH increases to 5% of ETH market cap (very high but not impossible). Secondary effects of this market sentiment change include:  stETH and ETH futures discount should grow wider into the merge, approaching 5% ETH price will reflect expected value of both mainnet and POW fork ETH up until the merge, and will then fall in value after the fork block stETH and futures discount should dissipate after merge due to removal of embedded fork value from ETH price Many liquidity providers will pull ETH from decentralized exchanges and pooled lending protocols in the lead up to the merge to avoid loss of fork value (potentially 5% immediate return from removing liquidity versus maintaining liquidity pool position) Combination of higher ETH borrowing costs, lower ETH decentralized exchange liquidity, and greater stETH discount has chance of creating deleveraging cycle on leveraged staking positions on Aave or Euler   Closing Thoughts Maker seems broadly committed to the transition to proof of stake. It is likely that much of the Maker community views the prospects of a POW fork (and potential value of forked Ether) to be very low. However, we should continue to monitor the situation and respond to any risks as they develop. In particular, monitoring futures basis, stETH discount, and ETH liquidity in defi liquidity pools may give advanced insight into expectations of fork adoption and value. If the market expected value of the fork grows sufficiently large, this could potentially cause disruption to defi protocols and liquidity in key crypto markets. ",

So, let\u2019s think about a few extremely important qualities going for ETC: (1) Market cap. It\u2019s #20, which is large and impressive especially given its supposed irrelevance (2) Infrastructure Network effects such as exchange listings and currency pairs and liquidity on fiat connected exchanges around the world Ethereum Classic price today, ETC to USD live, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap (3) ETH POW cap-ex is going to deploy somewhere. I used to mine ETC with ASIC (Bitmain) but haven\u2019t kept up on the state of ASIC mining on Ethereum vs GPU to have a view as to the scale of sunk costs out there. Theoretically the POW miners can move to another coin (costs are not sunk w/ GPUs). But now in this environment, I\u2019m thinking ETC would have more appeal than any other GPU shitcoin. (4) A surge of hash power on ETC at scale would address the security problems on the chain, initiating a virtuous cycle of new adoption for a user base (both apps, L2s, infrastructure providers, etc.) that has minimal work to recode for the ethereum classic chain (L1 original FTW!).

I am not really technical and very much on the outside looking in trying to understand as well WTF is going on with the coin. I mentioned this on Twitter but not here yet\u2026 As a lawyer, I also was attracted to ETC\u2019s facts and circumstances that put it in really strong position to be a clear commodity asset from a regulatory perspective. That means a much freer and certain compliance situation for financial products and services large pools of institutional capital can participate in. Really, only BTC, ETH, BCH and ETC can compete at that tier in the same way. Everything else has a lot harder case to make it is not a security (from a U.S. law perspective). We shall see what happens with XRP. That\u2019s extremely important. ",

Maybe if hashrate moves to ETC after the merge, it can finally get exchanges to offer reasonable deposit confirmation times again and defi over there could see some increasing activity. But on the other hand, defi activity has the potential to create greater instability and incentives for re-orgs (thinking back to the reorg-geth fracas from last year lol).

This may lead to higher risk of full utilization on their platform vs Aave or Compound. However, Euler has certain liquidation features that may limit possibility of 100% utilization causing insolvencies:    twitter.com    Michael Bentley @euler_mab  If ETH utilisation hits 100%, will liquidations involving ETH collateral on @eulerfinance still work? \ud83e\udd14  In short, yes. \u2705  This is because of a lesser known liquidation flow on the protocol that utilises the unique properties of eTokens and dTokens. \ud83d\udc47   12:53 PM - 7 Sep 2022           28                2             stETH price has largely recovered after trading below 0.96 ETH earlier this week:  image1100\u00d7620 39.7 KB    Overall the market risks from the merge seem to be abating somewhat, with falling value expectations of POW fork flowing through to less stress on stETH and defi liquidity pools.
