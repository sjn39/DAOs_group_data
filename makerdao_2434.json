                    "content": "REP as a collateral type for Maker causes problems with REP\u2019s security model and valuation because you have a \u201csnake eating its tail\u201d situation.  REP\u2019s value comes from future return on DAI, and DAI\u2019s value comes from a guarantee that it can eventually be redeemed for 1 USD worth of REP (ignoring other collateral types for the moment).  You can see that this creates a vicious feedback loop where if REP tanks sufficiently (e.g., causes the system to go slightly underwater) then the feedback cycle will result in both REP and DAI going to zero very rapidly.  This is easy to visualize with REP as the only collateral type, and while having other collateral types will mitigate this risk, having REP and DAI values linked makes doing security analysis on REP much harder. If Augur v2 ends up trading with ETH instead of DAI, then this isn\u2019t a problem (though then REP is to correlated with ETH to be useful for Maker). This problem is further complicated by the fact that REP is a token that is designed to fork, and when it does its value goes to zero almost instantly (a new token takes on its value). Even if you ignore the first problem mentioned above, the forking issue is a pretty big problem for a collateral type.  A good type of collateral is one with a low probability of going to zero suddenly (black swan event), but REP\u2019s value goes to zero by design anytime a fork happens. ",

Whoever holds the REP at that decision point must choose which path to follow by reading the details of a particular prediction market, researching the proper result of that prediction market, potentially discussing it with other humans, and then ultimately converting their REP to the universe that aligns best with reality as they perceive it. If the REP token was just wrapped, then anyone whose REP was in such a contract would need to delegate this decision to whoever controls the wrapper\u2019s choice.  While you could create some system of governance for making this decision, doing so introduces governance risk over that decision as a malicious governance effectively can control all of the REP that is behind the wrapper.

                    "content": "I think REP absolutely should be a collateral type. Maker and Augur are probably the two most symbiotic projects in the crypto ecosystem! There are two ways to solve this problem:  have CDP be wrapped REP where the Maker governance system decides which fork all REP in CDPs goes to.  As a CDP holder, if you don\u2019t like this risk, you can simply close out your CDP before the fork occurs and REP has to be migrated and make your own decision. Anyone holding REP is aware of forking risk anyways, although I imagine some lazy people will be happy to just follow w/e Maker governance decides for any CDPs that weren\u2019t closed pre-fork.  Doing it this way would get the best of both worlds for sophisticated users and for unsophisticated ones.  Another option would be for Maker governance prior to a fork (it\u2019s public / well known when this is with at least 60 days warning) to reduce the amount of REP CDP debt that can be taken out and/or raise rates on rep and eventually liquidate people who don\u2019t withdraw just prior to a fork. Doing this there\u2019s no \u201crep can go to 0\u201d issue and none of these issues are relevant and it can be done with 0 modifications to the way Maker already works in MCD  IMO rep adds diversification to Maker as one of the few ERC20 collateral types where the creators cant unilaterally steal funds / update the contract arbitrarily. This would add very minimal complexity relative to the benefits of including REP as a collateral type imo, and in the case of option 2, basically no additional complexity. ",

Augur\u2019s been live a year thus far and there have been 0 forks, so I think it\u2019ll be something relatively infrequent. In fact the game theory is setup such that a fork is a threat, but in theory should never have to happen. It is something that should be considered as a possibility though, even though the chances of it occurring are very small.

A good analogy for the first problem (snake eating its tail) would be if USD was backed by a basket of goods, and included in that basket were stocks that paid dividends in USD and were priced in USD.  One can easily imagine a world where monetary policy allowed such stocks into the basket, and over time the basket ended up full of only stocks.  At that point, you have a \u201cfully backed\u201d currency that isn\u2019t actually backed by anything, since the assets that back it are all themselves just promises on future USD. When you have a fully collateralized currency, it doesn\u2019t make sense to use promises on future yield of that currency as collateral for the currency itself because you can end up in a situation where you really don\u2019t have any actual collateral. I think that Maker should try to avoid any asset as collateral that can be reduced to a promise of future DAI yields.  It should also consider any asset that is a promise on future ETH yields to effectively share risk parameters with ETH. ",

And hence if the REP price going to zero takes 60 days would that not leave more than enough time to liquidate REP cdps without deluting MKR? Or do you imagine other problems like low liquidity or something else to make the REP price go to zero faster than 60 days? ",

This means that REP can be modeled as future-DAI, which can be simplified to DAI.  Thus, having REP as a collateral type for maker is similar to having DAI as a collateral type to Maker, which doesn\u2019t make sense. The 60 day window may be enough, but depending on the how much of total collateral is REP, it could cause a spike in DAI price as demand for DAI spikes during that 60 day window.  Maker governance will need to take care to not curve fit the DSR and stability fee during this time, even though DAI may slip its peg. ",

The tentative plan is to use DAI as the denomination token for Augur v2 which means Augur v2 will launch after McDAI launches.  This means that REP v2 cannot be used as a launch collateral type for McDAI because it won\u2019t exist yet. REP v1 could be used as a launch collateral type for McDAI, but it would be short lived since once Augur v2 launches, users are expected to migrate their REP from v1 to v2 (like Maker did a while back with MKR tokens).  This means that REP v1 will become scarce, and should a fork in v2 happen REP v1 will become worthless. ",
