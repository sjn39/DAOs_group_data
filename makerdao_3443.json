                    "content": "TLDR: reward people (a form of staking) for placing buy orders on MKR, locked for a fixed time period, to prevent flash crashes.  Hello, during the BT crash, the value of MKR dropped from 600usd to 200usd in a few hours. This corresponded to a 400m loss in MKR marketcap, and was caused by \u201conly\u201d 12m usd lost (caused by the 0-DAI liquidations). I just had the following idea. What if:  We ask people to place bids on MKR at p discount (e.g., p=-20\\%) wrt market price. These bids are locked for a fixed time frame T (e.g., T = 1 week). We reward these bidders at the end of time T, like with a fixed percentage q (E.g., q =0.1\\%\u2026 basically q should be a funciton of p) of the value of their bid.  Example:  Today 1MKR = 2000 DAI. A bidder may place a bid for 100MKR for 100*(80% of 2000) = 160k DAI. The bid is locked and stays active for 1 week. No matter what is the outcome, at the end of the week the bidder gets a reward of  160k DAI* 0.1% = 160 DAI.   There are two cases: 5a) If the prices of MKR does not drop in the market below 80% of 2000 DAI = 1600 DAI, then the bid is never used. And at the end of the week, the bidder gets back the 160k DAI. 5b) There is a crash in the value of MKR. In this case the bid is used to buy 100MKR for 160k DAI. TLDR: reward people (a form of staking) for placing buy orders on MKR, locked for a fixed time period, to prevent flash crashes. OasisDex might be just the perfect platform to develop this idea. @bartek ? Currently (due to the high fees) OasisDex is not practical. But if we talk about 1week (minimum) long bids, rewarded by the protocol, it makes again a lot of sense. ",

The reward structure can be computed off-chain entirely with MKR/DAI bonus for people providing such backstop liquidity. This is no dissimilar to many platforms providing airdrops to liquidity providers - any condition can be off-chain coded to make paricipants eligible for such airdrops. So if the bonus is higher than what you normally get on your stables on yield-aggregating platforms, this could be actually an interesting way to deploy your capital if you are a long-term long on MKR and want to buy the dip. The main problem with such scheme that I see is that dips of 20% happen quite regularly even in a bull market and have nothing to do with MKR. ",

Writing SC code is always the bottleneck.     bartek:  The main problem with such scheme that I see is that dips of 20% happen quite regularly even in a bull market and have nothing to do with MKR.   Building a buy wall on OasisDex might help reducing the downward fluctuations on the MKR price. In any case we have some kind of \u201cmeasurable assurance\u201d that, if a 20% drop happens, it will have to eat at least N-millions of buying orders. This can be a useful information for the risk teams (@Primoz ?)     bartek:  So if the bonus is higher than what you normally get on your stables on yield-aggregating platforms, this could be actually an interesting way to deploy your capital if you are a long-term long on MKR and want to buy the dip.

I suspect this will not get approved. People have rejected the idea of MKR-vaults (for good reasons).

I calculated that Maker could have offered a 6.2M 10%/yr bond type return DSR-L/B (liquidity/backstop whatever you want to call it) and not sold 1MKR to cover the DAI shortfall.  This would have been paid back in ~6-8months out of the surplus return costing the protocol and MKR users 300-350K DAI of additional interest, no MKR dilution sales. All that would be needed is a DSR facility to be set up that has a \u2018term\u2019 (say 6 months or 1 yr).
