                    "content": "With everything that has happened it\u2019s easy to forget that just last week we were shown that a sufficiently motivated actor with enough collateral can at low cost get hold of enough MKR to be able to affect the governance process and in some cases even get enough to dictate it. Needless to say, this is detrimental to the long-term stability of Maker. The recent routs in the markets have only lowered these costs and made it easier to borrow the majority of tokens and buy the rest. The following gives an overview of MKR in governance at the time of writing:  Proposals are usually decided by around 75k MKR. Most of the votes are cast by the recognized delegates. Between them recognized delegates have 77k MKR  There is a total of 9 recognized delegates The largest delegate controls 42% of all recognized delegate votes, the second largest 26%, and the third largest 13%   Shadow delegates have 21k MKR between them  There are total of 11 shadow delegates The largest shadow delegate controls 8% of all delegated votes, the second largest 6% and the third largest 5% Shadow delegates vote infrequently   Votes coming from outside of delegates are minuscule compared to delegated votes. Rarely breaking 2k MKR.  As we saw, gaining 40k MKR is easily possible just in the open market. This means that such an actor with alone of with support from a few actors inside the protocol could sway the vote in whatever direction desired. It also means that decisions are in large part determined by what the 3 largest delegates determine. Overall that leaves very few failure points for this vector of attack. In my mind the long-term solution is to increase the incentives for MKR holders to get involved in governance. There has been one great thread discussing that, and there has also been discussion about lock in periods or giving MKR more voting power for being locked up longer. My opinion is that the root cause is still too many disincentives for the MKR holder to have it participate in governance. While we address the root cause I think there might be a shorter-term solution to make the protocol more robust in the face of governance attacks. The key is in the MKR treasury. We could utilize MKR held in the treasury by placing it in some form of delegation. Some of the MKR in treasury is committed for vesting but at least 50k is freely available in the short and medium term (2-3 years). Delegation does not transfer any ownership and is for practical purposes freely able to be withdrawn should the need arise. I\u2019ve thought of several possible configurations.  Delegating parts of the treasury to recognized delegates as an even sum per delegate. As an example, 3k MKR. Immediately increases the barrier to governance attack by 27k MKR Decreases the relative voting power between the delegates Must make provisions for what happens when new delegates join or quits, and whether there should be other requirements to qualify (i.e., performance metrics, length of time served, minimum number of MKR delegated) Increases relative voting power to recognized delegates at the expense of shadow delegates and undelegated actors Must maintain a reserve of MKR in the treasury to be able to add more delegates or to redistribute at certain points. Delegating parts of the treasury to recognized delegates on a pro-rate to the numbers they already have delegated. Example 30k MKR total, 42% to largest delegate, 26% to second largest and so on.  Immediately increases the barrier to governance attacks by 30k Maintains the relative voting power between delegates Must make provisions for what happens when new delegates join or quits, and when delegates either get more or less MKR delegated, and whether there should be other criteria to qualify (i.e., performance metrics, length of time served, minimum number of MKR delegated) Increases relative voting power to recognized delegates at the expense of shadow delegates and undelegated actors   Creating a treasury voting proxy and delegating a set amount to it. Example 50k MKR.  Maintains relative voting powers between all MKR holders, except in cases where this delegation is deemed necessary. Must make provisions for who controls the treasury votes and under what circumstances they will be deployed. Potentially slower to react as it will not be a regular part of governance    The different parameters within each configurations merits their own discussions, but I wanted to provide a framework to start from. I fully realize that as a recognized delegate there is a potential conflict of interest here, but I still think there is merit to the discussion and if the community deems it fit that someone not similarly constrained put it into a more formal proposal.

                    "content": "Hi Justin, Thanks for putting together this post. There\u2019s clearly a lot of thought that\u2019s gone into it. However, I\u2019m going to suggest that we shouldn\u2019t pursue this idea. My reasoning is that while delegates are currently providing protection from Governance attacks, they also represent a risk as we are centralizing our voting power. By distributing a further significant amount of MKR to the Recognized Delegates, we would increase the centralization of voting power and expose the Protocol to risks without any recourse. Essentially, this is a case of quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Or, who watches the watchmen? We saw the power that the Recognized Delegates hold yesterday when they were able to pass an Executive Vote within 18 minutes of it being posted to the voting portal. While on this occasion, this was beneficent, the delegates can collude to pass a malicious proposal if they so wished, if they could write the requisite code, or had a collaborator able to do this for them. Under the current system, oversight is provided by those who have delegated MKR to the delegates. If a delegate or a group of delegates act maliciously, delegators are able to remove their MKR from the relevant delegate contracts, weakening the hat and allowing Governance to cancel the malicious Executive and prevent it from being enacted. In your proposal, the Recognized Delegates would also have control of a portion of the Protocol MKR. In the event of a Governance attack by the delegates themselves, Maker would have no ability to remove this MKR from the Recognized Delegates. To combat this, we would need to remove an additional 27,000 (9 x 3000 MKR) MKR from the delegate contracts, or find an additional 27,000 MKR to oppose the malicious Executive, which may prove challenging to enact within the GSM pause delay.

                    "content": "I\u2019ll echo @Patrick_J\u2019s comments here. The main reason this is dangerous is that once we delegate governance-owned MKR to delegates, there is no way to undelegate that MKR without the delegates voluntarily giving it up (given that the delegates effectively control governance, and that this control will be enhanced by the governance-owned MKR.) Basically this:     JustinCase:  Delegation does not transfer any ownership and is for practical purposes freely able to be withdrawn should the need arise.   Is not actually true. Given that governance would need to withdraw it, and that delegates would control governance with the MKR that governance had delegated to them.      JustinCase:  Creating a treasury voting proxy and delegating a set amount to it.   This is slightly less problematic, but still introduces a lot of risk. Mainly because this:     JustinCase:  Must make provisions for who controls the treasury votes and under what circumstances they will be deployed.   Is entirely dependent on the compliance of the individuals that hold keys to said multisig. We accept this risk with CU budgets, because we have to accept that trade-off in order to get anything done. However the practical downside is much much larger if you\u2019re delegating any large sum of MKR to a multisig. The risk of collusion is much higher given that the potential reward is much larger.  I do think you might be overestimating the risk and likelihood of a governance attack here. The GSM delay means that honest actors have 48 hours to organize and gather MKR to cancel any malicious proposal. In a worst case, a minority can activate emergency shutdown. The other point is that even if the price of MKR is lower, it doesn\u2019t meant that the liquidity for MKR is higher. Things start to get dangerous when price is low and liquidity is high. ",

This is a very valid point. Combined with the question on how do we ensure that MKR is returned from delegates have convinced me of the invalidity of my own idea. My logic was that anyone who delegates MKR has the power to undelegate but that ceases to be the case once that process effectively is controlled by the delegates themselves. Thank you @Patrick_J and @LongForWisdom for pointing out the flaws in my argument. ",
