                    "content": "I\u2019m looking to understand MKR & DAI better by building a really minimized version of DAI as an example (been having a hard time visualizing vat.sol, dog.sol, etc) and I\u2019m wondering if I need to include the MKR token? From a production standpoint, I 100% understand. Governance is a crucial piece to making sure a system like this works, and having a token volatile in price is nice to absorb some of the volatility of the stablecoin (low-vol coin). So I think as a note, I\u2019ll be sure to include how my minimized version would be terrible for production without the MKR token. But from a very minimalistic standpoint - I could make a demo without the MKR token right? A very inflexible contract that would probably have a hard time keeping a peg without the token, especially due to volatility of collateral. Any thoughts? ",

So what I\u2019m thinking\u2026 is that I leave out the MKR token for now, and make sure to add a note about what DAI and RAI do to make sure the protocol stays solvent. Our minimized version like I mentioned will just be to understand the core module. ",
