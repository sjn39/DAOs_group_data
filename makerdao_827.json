Yes, as the article says Russia could through bitcoin mining convert oil into Bitcoin - very inefficiently though.  But after that I disagree that will let them purchase many tangible things.  Tangibles things require a shipper, and shippers are either outright refusing to service Russia or are too afraid Western European sanctions will change and their ships carrying goods to Russia will be seized.  So other than goods from China and assuming China will accept Bitcoin to pay for its goods (but I doubt China will so agree), I don\u2019t think Russia can defeat the overall effectiveness of the sanctions with crypto.

They even anchor ships in international waters so that the oil is later loaded onto another transport ship (in Venezuela a large part of food and other products are imported, curiously you can even get everything even Ferraris these days). For some reason the economic sanctions do not are effective in the capacity of exchanges between countries, there is always a way, a partner country? (maybe black markets). The only one affected by this situation will be the Russian people, who have little to do with the decisions of their \u201cleader\u201d. ",

As you say, there will always be alternative ways to evade sanctions, and in the end it is the common citizen who pays the consequences. History has shown us that sanctions can be an effective tool in the short term, but once time passes without achieving their objectives, they become useless. And what better example to cite than the case of Cuba. ",
