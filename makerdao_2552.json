                    "content": "The peg issue led to an emergency increase of the DC of all collaterals. Still most are not full. On the other hand, after this discussion, the base rate will likely be lowered to -4%. Governance is not at ease with either large amounts of ETH collateral (today\u2019s meeting) neither large amount of USDC, neither not being compensated for all the risk taken. The near future promise just more of the same. I hope all those actions will be enough, but I\u2019m not sure. I think DeFi is more efficient than we assume. When a whale decide to stop using the USDC-A facility, I assume it follows our discussions. Getting to SF = 0% on USDC-A will bring $100k annually to the whale. $100k for checking a forum once a week. And if not this whale, there are other whales (3 whales were sinking 90% of the 80M DC of USDC-A). Within this context, none of the actions (raising strongly DC and lowering base rate) are silver bullets. We will see. Let\u2019s forgot this post for a year if the peg goes to 1 next week if you want. But in any case, having all collateral with a SF of 0% is not sustainable. If we hope DAI to have greater adoption, demand will remain strong. M1 just for the US is 5 trillions. In a short timeframe, when USDT will fail, 10 000 M DAI will be needed. Okay I\u2019m getting too far, you get the idea. It will mean no interest rate to secure the system, pay for the operations and remunerate the MKR holders. As I already tell, I think using stablecoin as collateral is crazy. Nevertheless, they can be a powerful policy tool (we will see when USDC-A SF will be 0%). It\u2019s like the PSM which is unlikely to see daylight in the near future. cDAI is not as real collateral, it\u2019s more a financial leverage, a money multiplier or a better way to impact interest rates on money markets. The nice thing is that we can keep a stability fee on first order collaterals (not DAI based) and set the cDAI stability fee as needed for the peg to stay around 1. It should be punishing rates in general, something like 90% of the average supply rate on compound\u2026 Is it risker to have 200M ETH at risk or 100M ETH + 100cDAI ? I would argue that it would be twice less expensive to make ETH vault whole in the later. I would also argue that central banks are doing just that. They are buying bills and treasuries, i.e. a $ lent for 3 months to 10 years, in repo operations  to issue $ and add liquidity to the system. I understand there are many points to analyze. Like how to proceed a recursive ES. What are the impacts of COMP farming on that. Are aDAI/cDAI the good way to express that. Maybe we should think the whole thing differently. But it seems to makes sense from a real world financial policy perspective and it would have a more direct impact on the DAI peg. As a cherry, we would help, and take a cut of, all DeFi lego block we support (see Uniswap discussion as well ). If there is interest, we can work the subject and later ask for a signal request. Let me know. ",

The main downside is that they come with technical risk. The more cDai you enable, the more the Maker system and MKR holders are exposed to losses from a bug in the compound infrastructure. This speaks towards spreading the risk across as many different defi platforms as possible (which will take time since each collateral onboarding is a lot of work). ",

In such case, all DAI holder could redeem a basket of tokens with some aDAI tokens inside. Now those aDAI tokens could be used in Aave to get DAI that can be redeemed again. At the end, some aDAI will not be used (amount too small). While not ideal, I don\u2019t think it really matters if cDAI/aDAI remains below 25% of all the collateral (it would take 3 round to reduce the amount of cDAI/aDAI to 1.5% of the collateral received). But above that threshold, the recursion would be painful. Therefore aDAI/cDAI can be a small multiplier (x1.3) with some drawbacks at the ES. Any feeling on the topic ? ",
