Right now, the Rinkeby faucet has been incredibly sportatic, and at the time of writing, it\u2019s been down for a few days. https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ This makes new developers journies into the space borderline impossible, especially for NFT developers who might use something like opensea to test their NFTs, as opensea uses the rinkeby testnet. I\u2019d love for an initiative to happen to find out:  Who currently admins the current faucet? How we can ask for 10,000,000 ETH (at least, as a starting point) to run a second faucet?  The current faucet has plenty to go around - 0x31b98d14007bdee637298086988a0bbd31184523 ",
