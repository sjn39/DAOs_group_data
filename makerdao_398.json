                    "content": "All, Following the Oracle team\u2019s gas budget request, I would like to discuss a proposal to purchase additional ETH held by the protocol as strategic reserves to hedge any sustained spikes in ETH price and Gwei. I performed a simple linear extrapolation of the prior six weeks of actual average Gwei per day through Q1 2023 (directly below) and put in some different ETH price points to estimate the $ impact on our oracle costs (bottom table). To be clear - this extrapolation is not my forecast, there are a number of factors which put downward pressure on Gwei. The data is simply to illustrate how quickly costs can increase even with somewhat modest increases in ETH price and Gwei.  1679\u00d7676 17.3 KB   782\u00d7167 9.72 KB  As you can see from the above, if ETH hits $15K by the end of Q1 and Gwei increases by 80% from 149 to 268 per day, we could see gas costs balloon by nearly 10x. We have seen multiple occasions over ETH\u2019s history and even this past year of it\u2019s price doubling within six weeks. As we\u2019re all aware, crypto markets can move quite quickly and without warning. Having an additional backstop of ETH in reserves will provide us with a larger safety net and could save tens of millions of dollars of funds. If sustained increases in Gwei or ETH do not materialize, the DAO can decide whether to sell a portion of the ETH or continue to hold in reserves. To be clear, this proposal is supplementary to the funds the Oracles Core Unit requested for Q1 and for emergencies. If the Oracle gas budget is exhausted prior to the end of any quarter, the Oracle team can request ETH from the strategic reserve. This Strategic Reserve could also be accessed by the PE team for smart contract deployments and testing. Pros  Hedges and mitigates higher oracle expenses due to sustained Gwei and ETH price appreciation Provides price exposure to increases in ETH price (which as we\u2019re aware has outperformed MKR)  Cons  Increases bad debt risk by having non-stable assets in the Surplus Buffer  Note - analysis assumes the same number of Oracles are active as were in October which will likely overestimate Oracle gas expenses as multiple collaterals are in the process of being offboarded.  How Much? Regarding the amount to be purchased, our initial recommendation is for 2,000 ETH, currently valued at $9,000,000. This is a little over 7 months of gas supply at current ETH & Gwei, and 4 months of supply at $15K ETH and 268 Gwei. Would really like to get community input on this number and the proposal in general. Longer term we will want to refine this number but today we are limited by the Surplus Buffer, which currently sits at $60M and will decrease by $8.8M once the Oracle gas budget is passed.  How to Implement? I have already brought up the idea with @Derek and he has started discussing with the PE team. If the DAO decides we should pursue this path, I believe the team will be able to write up a requirement doc and technical implementation.    Should the DAO purchase ETH as Strategic Reserves to Hedge Gas Costs?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        How much ETH (in DAI Terms) should be purchased for reserves?  3M 6M 9M 12M None Other Abstain     0 voters     ",

If we really do want to have strategic reserves, the price of MKR will be sufficiently correlated to ETH, even if it\u2019s not perfectly correlated. It is possibly confirmation bias on my end but I also think MKR is a lot more undervalued at this point than ETH, if we want to try something like this. It still has the same risk of us buying high but at least it\u2019s MKR that gets a nice price boost out of it. ",

As for the need of this strategic reserve; In a scenario with rising ETH price we are most likely also increasing revenue and should thus be naturally hedged. In a scenario of rapid market downturn we are likely to see an increase in gwei cost but a reduction in ETH price. This is where we expects the numbers of liquidations to increase and if worst comes to worst have to dip into the surplus buffer. On a political level this proposal seems to undermine the compromise that was reached in the big debate surrounding the surplus buffer. That is unfortunate and feeds into the narrative that Maker DAO doesn\u2019t really have any intention of ever burning any MKR. The logical response to constant proposals to either rise the surplus buffer or drain from it would be to start a similar vein of proposals to reduce the surplus buffer and I think we can all agree that would be very unproductive.

As far as I can tell this will directly remove funds from the surplus buffer and with it further postpone burning and worsening our ratio of surplus to non-stablecoin. 9M at current rates will take a month and a half to get back.   This is incorrect. Any asset purchased with surplus buffer funds will remain part of the surplus buffer. The only thing that changes is the volatility of the Surplus Buffer, which the community doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with given it\u2019s desire to hold ENS and AAVE tokens accrued through D3M. I spoke to Nik a while ago requesting an oracle gas cost estimate for the budgeting dashboard. At the time, estimated annualized oracle gas costs were only $1M. Oracle costs today are estimated nearly $16M/yr. Let me be clear - if we had the foresight at that time to start buying ETH using the surplus buffer, we would\u2019ve burned $15M more MKR than we have today (roughly 5,000 MKR tokens at current prices).

I completely agree that long term we should use contracts or options to hedge oracle gas costs assuming scaling solutions don\u2019t take care of that problem for us. The issue is that crypto derivatives market is quite nascent compared to traditional finance and we would take on additional risks pursuing this strategy without an infrastructure in place that can confidently support it. I also think your statement is a bit of an oversimplification, fuel costs for airlines have been flat if you compare Nov '14 vs Nov '21. Compare that to ETH which is up 630% over the past year, and 59000% over the past five. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison. There is also a fundamental reason that will likely drive ETH price higher - the merge - which is expected to reduce ETH issuance by 90%. Imagine what would happen to airline fuel prices if oil production was cut 90%.

Oracle Gas Expense Yes ETH is used directly to pay for Oracle Gas Expenses Yes, see snapshot below   Iq9x4Hp782\u00d7167 9.72 KB  A decision to hedge 0% of our Oracle Gas cost exposure is basically a bet that DAI will outperform ETH.

If you believe DAI will outperform ETH, holding MKR is honestly not a good idea   I do not beleive DAI will outperfom ETH in the long term, but hedging strategies are mainly used to hedge short term cash flows. If we buy ETHs using the surplus buffer at near ATH prices and there suddenly is a short term crash in the ETH price we will be in a situation were the surpluss buffer decreases in addition to a likely natural decrease in profits. Temporarely we can then find our self in a situation were we can be forced to sell some or all of the ETHs at a loss to be able to cover CU expenses. I am not saying that this is a very likely scenario, but it is only 4 months since the total SF income was about the same level as current CU expenses. Since this is presented as a hedging strategy I believe the strategy should not result in an increased risk for the protocol for short term drops in the eth price. If options were used instead this risk would be eliminated, but then we would of course in practise pay a fee to eliminate the downside risk and also introduce a counterparty risk. ",

I do believe in general it makes a lot of sense for Maker to have ETH exposure PCV style. It\u2019s just a great idea because ETH is a great asset, especially staked ETH - and also AMM LPs that support dai liquidity that can provide both nice exposure and returns plus increase the utility and competitiveness of Dai. I would see it more in terms of going from MKR holdings to ETH holdings rather than using cash to purchase ETH. This idea of getting good protocol owned liquidity and how much it could help our objectives is a cornerstone of my v2 tokenomics proposal that I hope to share \u201csoon\u201d ",

Airlines do not have growth in demand that is correlated with fuel prices. MakerDAO has a product whose profits are highly correlated to the price of ETH.     Aes:  What happens if Gwei continues rising but ETH price doesn\u2019t and thus Oracle gas costs continue to rise and eat into profits?   You mean gas goes up in terms of gwei while ETH price remains constant? Then having strategic reserves of ETH makes no difference because the price of ETH hasn\u2019t changed.     Aes:  There is always risks to hedging but there is an asymmetric risk reward to buying ETH as it can go up multiples, as can Gwei, whereas it can only decrease 100% in which case we are screwed anyways.   ETH prices can drop any amount that isn\u2019t 100% and the protocol is not at all screwed. If anything, we\u2019d be generating lots of profits if liquidations go smoothly. Crypto can and has dropped by 90% and if it does, the protocol will actually spend less on gas.     Aes:  Let me be clear - if we had the foresight at that time to start buying ETH using the surplus buffer, we would\u2019ve burned $15M more MKR than we have today (roughly 5,000 MKR tokens at current prices).   Of course everyone wishes they\u2019d triple mortgaged their house to buy ETH when it was $80. That\u2019s hindsight talking and does not mean there will necessarily be a repeat of that growth from the current price. All this move does is speculate that ETH prices will go up and that is needless risk being added to the protocol. As I mentioned in my first post, if we absolutely must speculate, at the very least, it should be on MKR but even this is not advisable. ",

I suspect that ETH price and VaR are positively correlated - as ETH price rises, the volume of non-stablecoin risky debt increases which increases potential amount of losses during a market crash. So separately from holding ETH to hedge oracle and contract deployment costs, it could also make sense to allocate some of the reserves to ETH to help maintain surplus buffer to non-stablecoin debt ratios during bull runs. We would need to systematically take profit on the way up to save stable reserves for price crashes - this could be accomplished through investing in an AMM pool (eg UNIV2DAIETH), or using an index fund style rebalancing mechanism based on fixed periods or maximum variance versus a target allocation.

                    "content": "    rune:  I voted no because I believe that gas and eth price aren\u2019t necessarily linked, and gas is more related to the economic activity happening on chain. So while I like the idea of acquiring ETH I\u2019m just not sure that gas expenses are a good justification for it, but like others are saying, if we can show that it does matter and it is a good form of hedging costs then I\u2019m all for it.   Thanks for the comments Rune. I did not mean to imply that ETH price and Gwei were correlated, though I can see how that could be viewed as implicit from the table I posted - Gwei could spike up or down regardless of ETH price due to demand for on chain transactions as you mention. The point I was trying to make with that data set was that an increase in both ETH and Gwei simultaneously exponentially increases our oracle gas costs which may not be intuitive to those less familiar with the economics of oracles. While the motivation for the proposal was my concern with oracle costs, there are strong benefits to holding ETH outright in the form of staked ETH or through an AMM LP as it is a productive asset. I\u2019m also strongly in favor of the protocol providing AMM LPs as you mention and believe @MakerMan is working on a proposal to do just that. Purchasing ETH or stETH could be the first step in pursuing that path. Circling back to my motivation for hedging these costs - what I see looking at the L1 landscape is:  Strong momentum in unique wallet creation Network transactions increasing More and more dev activity, projects, and integrations built on ETH An increasing amount of ETH being locked in smart contracts supply of ETH on exchange at 3 year lows Over 50% of ETH supply hasn\u2019t moved in >1 year an NFT boom using the more gas intensive ERC-721 standard  On top of that, the merge is likely to take place by the end of Q1 2022 and will likely reduce new supply by a factor of 10 and make the ETH protocol net deflationary. With the merge, staking ETH will be made available to all users and the APY will increase from the ETH 2.0 smart contract due to transaction fees going to validators. I believe we will see a significant portion of ETH supply vacuumed into staking contracts dramatically reducing circulating ETH supply. These market dynamics could lead to a scenario where both ETH price and Gwei simultaneously increase and our oracle gas costs explode. If we happen to lose market share (due to LM incentives offered elsewhere or other competitive pressures) we could be in a situation where the increase in revenue (if any) does not offset the increase in oracle costs and we suffer significant margin compression. We could take a band aid approach and offboard most non-ETH and WBTC collaterals but that is not in the best interest of MakerDAO\u2019s users. There seems to be a general overconfidence that we will maintain ETH market share indefinitely. Perhaps that will happen and maybe that\u2019s even the most likely outcome, but we should be hoping for the best and planning for the worst case scenarios. Today we still have extremely high concentration risk amongst borrowers which could exacerbate any shifts in market share. I hope like hell that L2s explode and take some of the strain off of L1 - but we cannot plan for this just like the world cannot plan for someone to save the world from climate change. Actions must be taken. Perhaps I\u2019m wrong about all of this and we\u2019re on the precipice of another multi-year bear market. However if there\u2019s a chance I\u2019m right, even if it\u2019s small, I believe we should hedge at least a portion of our exposure. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. ",

                    "content": "    Aes:  While the motivation for the proposal was my concern with oracle costs, there are strong benefits to holding ETH outright in the form of staked ETH or through an AMM LP as it is a productive asset. I\u2019m also strongly in favor of the protocol providing AMM LPs as you mention and believe @MakerMan is working on a proposal to do just that. Purchasing ETH or stETH could be the first step in pursuing that path.   Sorry to say @Aes but given the lack of feedback I don\u2019t think the AMM LP proposal is going anywhere which is too bad honestly. I was thinking about the whole purchase ETH for strategic reserves and it makes more sense to purchase ETH and pair it with DAI in a v2 AMM to earn the 10%+ return.  But if you wanted to supercharge this - pair the ETH with USDC and get more like 30+% on the v2 ETH-USDC LP.   (I have been tracking the uniswap v2 ETH-USDC and ETH-DAI returns for almost a year)  image1248\u00d7694 47.2 KB  On this chart 0 is ~300 days ago and 322 is the most recent data point. Ignore the accumulated return as that a accumulated since I started tracking.   You want to look at the ~24hr average (which is really more like a 5point - no longer tied to 24hrs due to less data accumulation). Point here isn\u2019t to just earn return but to do it in a way that protocol buys ETH when price decreases (most likely time we would need it) and even if ETH prices increases by 4x we still have stablecoin (DAI/USDC) paired with ETHI to buy the ETH back.   What we lose is buying 2x the ETH and just holding it.    Though here if ETH price increases (like you are suggesting) protocol earnings \u2018should\u2019 rise enough to stave off the expense compression you are suggesting.   BTW:  We don\u2019t have to take all the funds and buy ETH to pair with DAI/USDC but only a part.   Also the LP will increase in value according to sqrt(ETH) price increase due to v2 AMM LP selling ETH and buying stablecoin. Also I have been watching how the protocol is burning MKR with liquidation funds.    Honestly it would be nice if the protocol, when liquidating ETH, instead of banking DAI could bank at least 1/2 of the DAI profits in ETH.   I am a bit mixed on how/where to implement this but I think the absolute best way for the protocol to accumulate ETH is when we are auctioning it.   The price we pay is basically the price we would sell it at and this is always when the price drops lower than a vault holder expects.    I think it would be more efficient to figure out how to take our ETH liquidation profits in ETH vs. DAI than to alter the flapper to use DAI to buy ETH, but this is exactly how the protocol should build such a strategic reserve. Pros here for flapper doing this:  Basically DCAs over time with part of the DAI profits - buy with profits today for future expense tomorrow.  Cons  need to alter flapper behavior (but people are already talking about this generally) to buy ETH and MKR.  Pros for liquidations doing this:  Get best price (i.e. this extra buying only happens when a vault is liquidated and usually occurs to give best prices) and use only fraction of the DAI the profits from liquidations to buy ETH.  Cons  Need to alter liquidations to do this. Complicates liquidation process.  Because of my thinking above (to have this buying be staggered and in direct relation to flapping or liquidation profits) I abstained rather than vote in the poll(s).   How much should we buy with the above model.  Frankly I\u2019d say lets just decide much much liquidation, flapper profit to allocate as a percentage and then decide how much ETH to have on hand and how much to pair with ETH in a v2 type AMM (for auto-compounding and other reasons) to generate long term return and just let this accumulate continually.   Maker will always need ETH and DCAing int a v2 type AMM auto compounding at 10-30% or (.03-.1%/day) is much more attractive than just buying and sitting on ETH. ",

                    "content": "This is a very complicated topic indeed. Starting from first principles, we can control some of the complexity. The problem at hand revolves around two principles.  Transaction demand:  Given low enough gas price, the demand for on-chain compute is unlimited.  Gas price:  Gas price is no thing other than the price at which the participants in the Ethereum Blockchain marketplace are willing to exchange ETH for on-chain compute at a given point in time. If we want to understand what drives the price of gas, then we need to look at which activities are occupying the largest share of the limited on chain compute. Does a contraction in ETH supply growth due to ETH2.0 merge increase the price at which the participants in the Ethereum Blockchain marketplace are willing to exchange ETH for on-chain compute? Is this equation altered if the price of 1 ETH is 2000 Dai as opposed to 10,000 Dai? By themselves, these variables do not alter the gas price equation. I conjecture that rather than gas price being causally correlated with ETH price, gas spikes are more directly affected by ETH price momentum, or with price momentum of other on-chain assets, such as NFTs, liquidity pools, or maker vaults. For this reason, gas price is likely to go up when the price of ETH goes up rapidly, but also when the price of ETH goes down rapidly. Absent this volatility, gas price will be determined by organic demand for on chain transactions. It will be natural for organic demand for on chain compute to increase over time. However, compute supply will also significantly increase in the near to mid term due to sharding. This may provide temporary easing to compute demand pressure. Because demand for free on chain compute is unlimited, we cannot expect sharding to decrease gas costs linearly with respect to capacity increase. Instead, I conjecture that it will be a logarithmic relation. This leaves L2 scaling as the only hope for a permanent solution to the problem. This however, is not guaranteed. We have thus identified future gas cost as a material risk for MakerDAO\u2019s investors. It is therefore very important to have foresight when it comes to the handling of gas costs required for the continued operation of MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain compute. At the moment, the largest cost is associated with the operation of Oracles. Let\u2019s enumerate possible strategies for mitigating risk associated with increasing gas costs:  Increase earnings by acquiring more vault customers. Carefully evaluate opportunity cost of on-boarding and off-boarding collateral types. Develop more gas-efficient protocols for our on-chain compute. Offload on-chain compute into L2. Opportunistically allocate surplus capital to an ETH reserve in order to hedge.  Each and every one of these strategies should be evaluated and pursued simultaneously. Each represents unique challenges and opportunities. Hedging represents a specially complex challenge because unlike with the other 4 strategies, it is hard to determine a priori whether or not a course of action will be successful. For this reason, I want to emphasize that hedging should be inherently opportunistic in the sense that it must be pondered against opportunity cost, and executed only if the market provides a clear and evident opportunity to do. Opportunity cost will not be easy to determine, because hedging against future gas cost by exchanging Dai for ETH depends at the very least on the future values of:  USD (Dai) MKR ETH Gwei base fees  Therefore, depending on the scenario, opportunity cost will be governed by a combination of these factors. For instance:   Market flash crash scenario - Price of ETH vs Dai collapses, but the product of ETH price * GWEI base fee spikes with respect to Dai. Cheap ETH but expensive gas. This means our hedge fails because purchasing ETH just-in-time will outperform the anticipated hedge.   Parabolic bull run scenario - Price of ETH vs Dai skyrockets, and gwei base fee spikes. Expensive ETH, very expensive gas. This means our hedge will be profitable, as we will avoid consuming the supply buffer at a time when ETH price is higher.   However, in both scenarios you have to compare the opportunity cost of ETH vs MKR. Remember that the purpose of the supply buffer is first and foremost to prevent bad debt from causing us to mint MKR, but beyond that, it allows the DAO to return material value back to holders by repurchasing and burning MKR. This means that for our hedge to be profitable, ETH must outperform not only the Dai, but also MKR. Because the intrinsic value of ETH is much harder to estimate than the intrinsic value of MKR, it seems very speculative to allocate capital to ETH when MKR looks undervalued. Hedging in such a situation would mean choosing a less certain opportunity over a more certain one. If we are to allocate surplus funds to an ETH reserve, it would be wisest to do so at a time when ETH has been in a downtrend for a significant period of time, and at the same time MKR appears relatively expensive. And if we are to spend those funds in the ETH reserve to cover gas costs, it should be done at a time when Gwei base fees are greatly overpriced in terms of Dai relative to the baseline, and ETH is significantly more expensive than the price at which it was purchased. Whether or not such conditions will ever be met, and whether or not we will be able to recognize and act on such opportunities is very hard to forecast. In any case, the surplus buffer should not contain volatile assets. ETH reserves if any, should be held in a treasury instead. The surplus buffer needs to be stable in order to pay out CU salaries and other expenses, and in order for bad debt risk to be managed properly. We don\u2019t want to spend our ETH reserves in order to cover bad debt because liquidations happen at times when ETH price has downward momentum. I do like the idea of using profits from ETH vault liquidations in order to accumulate ETH over time, as this requires little governance overhead and is inherently opportunistic. It would be very interesting to do a back-test and check whether or not this could have been enough to cover oracle gas costs in the past. ",
