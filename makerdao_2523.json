                    "content": "I had a thought today - as usual I hear the sighs now - regarding how Maker could take advangate of the token farming craze that could help us in different ways. Consider making one or more MKR tokens to take advantage of this.  Those of us participating in forums basically get rewarded not just in DAI but say 1/5 of this new governance token. Those with vaults get another 1/5 Groups or individuals doing actual development 1/5-2/5 Another 1/5 for market operations (i.e going into the reserve surplus fund)  The above numbers are arbitrary.   The point here is that governance could mint another 1M say MKRG or MKRC and then give those away based on some above split as compensation for work done on the protocol and to people who have vaults open. Additionally registered sourCRED focum wallets that have MKR deposited in governance should get an additional multiplier based on the fact they don\u2019t just participate in forums but also actually have MKR in governance and vote.   The key point being a vote is what garners the multiplier. Since we are doing the sourCRED report weekly perhaps we could do the distribution weekly. Finally when issued the statement that goes with the MKRC or MKRG is that eventually the MKRC and MKRG will be able to participate in governance directly (how long this takes to integrate or how much weight up to MKR governance proper).   Since we are already working on DSChief changes.  I am not saying we have to include this in the upcoming revision to DSChief but rather than seeing comp farming as a problem I think we should take advantage by minting a second MKRG/MKRC coin (maybe even a couple MKRC going to vault owners, MKRG going to sourCRED folks).   Don\u2019t get me wrong I am not coupling this with sourCRED because I am #2 in cred or earnings but because I think it will help provide a reward and compensation route greater than DAI and we can directly see who is doing what simply by looking at MKRG and MKRC.   We also create greater value for the eco-system. The idea of parsing some of this out to MKR holders at this point I am mixed on.   I think they should get a piece - but honestly I am thinking more of trying to create multiple reward models to reward new contributors here as well as our vault holders.   The split is arbitrary but I wanted the same amount of new MKR to go to people here in forums, as well as 2x this to the real developers, EPCs, as go to the vault holders. Remember the key way to make this valuable is to \u2018drip\u2019 it out from the start vs. flooding.  I am not sure the market will bite on this but I toss it out as another positive idea to create value that rewards participation and work as well as vault owners.  In the end MKR holders will and do benefit not just from vault owners that take out loans but everyone contributing to helping to grow Maker and make it more robust>? I think to make this effective we need to strike while the iron is hot so ideas on how to do this fast and easily are welcome. ",

Because then how MKR couples it into governance can be dealt with \u2018independent of MKR\u2019 it also doesn\u2019t dilute MKR proper.  It also then tracks vs. using MKR everywhere.  It is a new token with a new distribution mode and this is what the farming craze folks seem to want. Literally MKR proper via governance could decide that MKRC votes in DSChief at a 10MKRC to 1MKR etc.  It gives governance complete control over its new \u2018comp\u2019 MKR babies.     Aaron_Bartsch:  On further thought I\u2019m not sure pure monetary incentives ever really work to retain a community long term. It\u2019s usually the intrinsic values that keep people together.   I disagree.   More tools are better and NOT rewarding people in almost every case I have seen tends to hollow out the volunteer groups.   Compensating them tends to create a more robust volunteer/work \u2018market\u2019.   But I believe this is a valid debatable point.   Which is why trying things, applying scientific method to optimizing is appropriate which is why I believe coupling it with sourCRED is ideal as that model is designed to take advantage of adatability to mitigate gaming for rewards to achieve greater community dynamism.

That by itself measures participation in the community in ways not measured currently except by sourCRED - can\u2019t even look at DAI to determine.    Could even tie two tokens together like ethtrader did. A MKRC_VALUE and MKRC_NFT the NFT simply does not move and to do anything with MKRC\u2019s in governance use the MKRC_vote = min(MKRC_VALUE, MKRC_NFT).    But this is simply an idea to capture something of this value craze in farming not to absolutely create a new governance token.

I entirely agree that using incentives in the protocol is necessary - we have the arbitrage game for vault creation, and MKR burning to encourage proper governance. Maybe if Maker was just launching it would have been an option to farm MKR instead of an ICO, but I think the cat is out of the bag at this point ",

Once enough people go \u2018not a great idea\u2019 then just bury it without replies.

We can also make MKR A and B function similar to debt tranches, like MKR.A has priorities for getting burned first and then MKR.B gets burned after x% of MKR.A has been burned from fees collected.  MKR.B would be created from the model you\u2019re describing; voters would get richer with this new token and it would incentive users of the CDP system to become stakeholders in governing the system as well.    I\u2019m sure there are many other dynamics that need more research and would not work well using this model, but it is an idea. ",
