                    "content": "[This message was originally posted on Optimism Discord #gov-general on Nov 9 2022. Replicating it here per the request of Lavande] We have been working with the OP Foundation and provided them with all requested information and will continue to work with them as needed. All assets have been returned to Optimism and all OP tokens repurchased. As noted by @lavande  there was not a no-sale policy in place when we received our grant and at the time. That being said, we had no intentions of moving any OP assets off chain under normal circumstances. To clarify, this is the event that caused our team to jump into action and move all our assets: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/17/optimism-token-flash-crashes-10-on-false-rumors-of-a-major-hack/ At the time DAO team members reached out to the Foundation and other members in the community and received very little information or understanding of what was happening. While the exploit proved to be false, no one knew it as it was happening nor the extent to which it would affect the chain. We reacted quickly in the moment while also continuing to follow through on our governance proposal.  It was decided to protect the assets in order to compete the original proposal should there be a larger issue with the chain. Hindsight is 20/20 and our team agrees that once the dust had settled the tokens should have been repurchased in the days following. Instead, we move asset back bit-by-bit and continued to build out the NFT and the OPIncubator program during this time with great success. We also launched two other NFTs on OP and continued to build on the chain. As a DAO we are focused on driving TVL and usage to L2s, and Optimism is a big part of our focus. As I explained in my post on the gov forum earlier, we\u2019ve been steadily buying back OP since the initial sale in order to fulfill the proposal obligations (and we were going to continue that until all OP was repurchased). We also have been distributing those tokens as part of fulfilling our proposal. 91,050 OP as of 11/9/22 has been spent in accordance with the proposal and the balance remains in the multi-sig as you have already seen. Last week we awarded an additional 27.5k OP tokens in our second round of the OPIncubator program that will go out shortly to the grant recipient project. There continues to be a dialogue that somehow Layer2DAO made a $200k profit in this process. The statement in categorically false and the narrative is being pushed while knowingly being false in order to harm Layer2DAO as part of a personal vendetta by Velodrome team members against one of our team members (as they confirmed on the governance call yesterday). The attached spreadsheet shows all the transaction amounts, as well as the delta in value of the ETH opposed to OP. The drop in value of ETH is roughly 30% and the drop in OP token value between sale and repurchase was 32.27%. As you can see from the repurchasing line items it was often down at a loss to the original sale value as ETH dropped faster in value up until October. It has always been our intent to repurchase all tokens and fulfill our obligations to our governance fund proposal. The spreadsheet does not include bridging and swap fees, which have been substantial.  op-trades1280\u00d7663 87.1 KB  We have continued to develop new projects in the OP space and will continue to do so. The intimidation and fear mongering towards other protocols by Velodrome team members seems counter productive to the Foundation\u2019s goals for OP governance and the health of the community. We really hope the larger governance community and the OP Foundation can see through this and stop OP governance from being turned into a playground for bad faith actors who want to use it for carrying out their personal vendettas. Our goal is to be positive contributors to the Ethereum Layer 2 community, and have been cooperating with the OP Foundation every step along the way and provided complete transparency. I am happy to answer any further good faith questions directly. ",

                    "content": "Hi Optimism community! You might already know me, but if not, I\u2019m Exosphere, one of the core team members of Layer2DAO. I co-founded Layer2DAO at the beginning of 2022 to provide the Ethereum L2 space a central community, coordinate promotional efforts to further the L2 space, and collaborate on projects. I\u2019m also a delegate on Optimism. Many of our efforts focused on Optimism, as one of the most promising L2 networks. We chose to launch an early adopter NFT collection on Optimism that allowed L2 early adopters to mint for free an NFT that corresponded in level to the number of L2 networks that they bridged assets to in 2021 (example of the Level 1 NFT). We partnered with Quix (we helped them launch their NFT launchpad) and ended up minting over 20,000 NFTs, many of which where the first time someone owned an NFT on an L2. This NFT activity ended up making us eligible for OP governance round 0, with a 300,000 OP allocation. The center piece of our proposal was the OPIncubator program, which over six rounds would distribute 27500 OP each to six projects that our community deemed worthy of the support. OP Governance was very young at that time, and there was limited guidance what the OP grant should be used for, especially compared to today. The program one of our community members came up with was a way to allow our Layer2DAO community to decide which projects would receive some of our OP tokens, while also teaching on-chain governance to people that might have been priced out on other chains. In late 2022 the Optimism community was shocked that Quix, the hub of NFT activity on Optimism, announced that they were shutting down. Given that we had a front-row seat with our own NFTs, we saw NFT trading drop significantly on Optimism. In our opinion that was a significant blow to the future of the Optimism network, and the success of NFTs on L2. Our community sprung into action and started looking for other projects that would fill the void. After not being able to find a team that was stepping in, Weston, one of Layer2DAO\u2019s core team members, decided to take action assemble a team to start NFT Earth. Personally, I was asked to be an advisor to the project, which I was glad to do considering how important NFTs were to onboarding people to the L2 ecosystem. Although some of the team overlaps between the Layer2DAO and NFT Earth, they function as completely separate entities and are governed differently. Eventually the NFT Earth team approached Layer2DAO with the possibility of applying for an OPIncubator grant. We thought this would be an excellent use of the program, since Optimism was lacking an Optimism-focused successor to Quix and NFT activity was severely down on the network. This was one of several funding sources that NFT Earth was able to secure. The project needed to move fast since they quickly started incurring 5-digit hosting expenses and needed to capture market share to be viable. From our knowledge the NFT Earth team has used their OPIncubator grant as planned and has succeeded in standing up a fully functional NFT exchange that already has captured a portion of NFT trading volume on Optimism. They launched their own token via airdrop to build further community and create incentives for trading NFTs on Optimism. Over the last week, some Optimism community members have started targeting NFT Earth and Layer2DAO, spreading baseless accusations and lies. While we are unsure of their motivations, I believe this is a mix of old grudges (Velodrome team and Weston have a known history of conflict) and competitiveness (rumors have it that OptiChads is working on their own NFT exchange and want to kneecap NFT Earth before it receives an OP grant in round 11). They are spreading lies about these projects on social media, OP governance, and personally attacking Weston in ways that break the Optimism community guidelines. They are directly approaching our partner projects and bullying them into severing ties with us. I urge the Optimism community to see past these intimidation tactics and reject this harassment by the offending teams. Their playbook of flooding Optimism governance with so much misleading information that no one can tell truth from fiction only hurts the Optimism governance experiment. Layer2DAO prides itself in exposing the larger crypto community to the decentralization that L2s offer and remains focused on helping onboard the larger crypto community to L2s. Please let me know if you have any questions that I can answer. ",
