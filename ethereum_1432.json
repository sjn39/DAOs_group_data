I was looking forward to collaborate on optimizing the EIP process, scaling Magicians globally and methods to decentralize the product backlog without all the noise. Hopefully this message gives sufficient time to make any changes if needed. Good news is that my partner and friend @Jason_C  will be there!  @boris thanks for all your contributions @jpitts Jason had so many good things to say about you, hope to meet you sometime soon @gcolvin And we miss each other once again - maybe I\u2019ll see you in CO Have fun and excited for great things to happen!
