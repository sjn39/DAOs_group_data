It is ERC1538: Transparent Contract Standard: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1538 I am looking for feedback. Here is a list of benefits from the standard:  The ability to add, replace or remove any function. Each time a function is added, replaced or removed, it is documented with events. Build trust over time by showing all changes made to a contract. Unlimited contract size. The ability to query information about functions currently supported by the contract. One contract address that provides all needed functionality and never needs to be replaced by another contract address.  ",
