If I remember that right I can\u2019t help but wonder if people are like - ** maybe that was a mistake.** Also want Maker to pay attention - should these markets get ugly and the USDC PSM drain DAI could have PEG issues rapidly as well.   This is especially true if Antman soaks up 1-2B DAI borrow and immediately swaps it to USDC via PSM. Fortunately Maker has borrowers - that are likely to step up at some PEG point to buy DAI.   The question will be what that point is.   Going to be interesting to see PEG management via SF, DSR, whatever between .99x and 1 should it happen and I hope to hell people are starting to think about what actions Maker will take should the above manifest.
