In addition, I found that if the repayment amount is relatively small, it will succeed. Like this transaction of more than 1,000 DAI, https://etherscan.io/tx/0x003f68e5b24b8142bc4fb682c1d38599912dd1cf0c02479dbae940b00855306d will fail. What is the issue and how do I solve this?

I think when you repay Dai you must keep the remaining debt above the dust limit (currently 5000 Dai on ETH-A vault), or repay in full. It may be reverting because you are trying to repay some Dai and result would be debt more than 0 and less than 5000 Dai. ",

We have a bit of a poor design on the current Oasis Borrow (will be fixed in the next few weeks on the new version) where it only checks if your allowance is >0 - it should really check if you have enough allowance for the input. So I would use this tool I have linked above though and increase the Dai allowance on the DSProxy to allow you to set a much higher value to let you pay back more, up to what you decide to set your allowance too. But please note that when you payback, it will then reduce your allowance by this amount (if that makes sense). Again, apologies for the experience on Oasis today, is getting much better very soon  ",
