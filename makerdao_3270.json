                    "content": " MIP4c2-SP7: MIP4 Amendments  Preamble MIP4c2-SP#: 7 MIP to be amended: MIP4 Author(s): David Utrobin(@Davidutro) Contributors: Status: Formal Submission Date of Amendment Submission: 2021-02-11 Date of ratification: <yyyy-mm-dd>   Specification  Motivation This amendment MIP proposes changes to MIP4. The first change is an allowance for MIP amendments to be able to use the Weekly Governance Cycle for the first 3 months after a MIP has passed. Using the weekly cycle will get an amendment ratified as quickly as 3 weeks instead of 2 months with the original process. This grants new MIPs greater flexibility to be fixed early and fast, improving overall governance efficiency. The second being an allowance for multiple MIP amendments to happen in one proposal. This is to make it convenient to mass-amend MIP sets that often have dependencies on each other. The amendments would be change-centric rather than MIP-centric. The third being an allowance for multiple MIP removals to happen in one proposal. This is to make it convenient to mass-remove MIP sets that often have dependencies on each other. The removals would be change-centric rather than MIP-centric.  Amended Components  MIP4: MIP Amendment and Removal Process  c1 c2 c3 c4 c2-SP c3-SP c4-SP     Amendment Pull Request (PR)  link to PR   Relevant Information  None    MIP4: MIP Amendment and Removal Process  Preamble  MIP#: 4 Title: MIP Amendment and Removal Process Author(s): Rune Christensen (@Rune23), Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Contributors: @LongForWisdom, David Utrobin (@Davidutro) Type: Process Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Date Ratified: 2020-05-02 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a    References MIP4c2-Subproposal-Template.md MIP4c3-Subproposal-Template.md MIP4c4-Subproposal-Template.md  Sentence Summary MIP4 defines processes for the amendment and removal of accepted MIPs.  Paragraph Summary The Amendment and Removal Process-MIP outlines the process for very small and relatively superficial changes to MIPs. This MIP Contains two Process Components, the first dealing with the Removal of ratified MIPs, and the second dealing with Amending current active MIPs.  Component Summary MIP4c1: Purpose Description Suggests the purpose of the amendment and removal processes and possible reasons for using each process. MIP4c2: Amendment Process for MIPs Older than 3 Months A process component which defines a method and template for the amendment of an accepted MIP older than 3 Months. MIP4c3: Amendment Process for MIPs Younger than 3 Months A process component which defines a method and template for the amendment of an accepted MIP younger than 3 Months. MIP4c4: MIP Removal Process A process component which defines a method and template for the removal of an accepted MIP.  Motivation The motivation behind this proposal is that changing small details to MIPs should not require the original MIP to become obsolete or replaced, so this Process-MIP is needed to define and outline the process behind making these changes to MIPs once they have already been ratified and implemented. Additionally, this MIP defines the process for the removal of MIPs that are have become no longer useful.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP4c1: Purpose Description Amendments MIP Amendments that preserve the MIP number can be performed as long as there are no changes to the logic of the MIP or to the MIP\u2019s external output dependencies. They should only be used when minor changes are required. Amendments to MIPs older than 3 months since acceptance will follow the normal process associated with the monthly governance cycle, with rules outlines in c2. Amendments to MIPs younger than 3 months since acceptance will follow a different set of rules outlined in c3. These enable younger MIPs to be amended more quickly. Amendments to multiple MIPs are allowed to be submitted as a single proposal if the changes are linked in some way like being part of a MIP set or part of a larger change that affects multiple MIPs. Validity The validity of MIP Amendments is ultimately up to the community but possible reasons for amendments could be (but are not limited to):  A formatting change Typos Rewording/clarification  MIP Amendments are invalid if, based on the assessment of the community, the changes are so severe that they should be achieved through a MIP replacement instead. Removals MIP4 also enables the removal of one or multiple MIPs that become obsolete. If there are other MIPs that depend on a MIP that is being removed, they must also be removed or amended in the same governance cycle, otherwise the removal will be invalid. Removal of multiple MIPs are allowed to be submitted as a single proposal if the changes are linked in some way like being part of a MIP set or part of a larger change that affects multiple MIPs.  MIP4c2: Amendment Process for MIPs Older than 3 Months MIP4c2 is a Process MIP component that regulates the amendment of one or multiple Accepted MIPs that are older than 3 months. MIP4c2 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 3 month  Frozen Period: 1 month  Governance Cycle: Monthly  Other Requirements: None.  All MIP4c2 subproposals must use the template located at MIP4c2-Subproposal-Template.md.  MIP4c3: Amendment Process for MIPs Younger than 3 Months MIP4c3 is a Process MIP component that regulates the amendment of one or multiple Accepted MIPs that are Younger than 3 months. Amendment Subproposals must be submitted to RFC for one week, for the Default Feedback Period. This is followed by a one week duration Signal Request thread, during which the Amendment proposal cannot be changed, fulfilling the 1 week frozen period. MIP4c3 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 1 week  Frozen Period: 1 week  Governance Cycle: Weekly  Other Requirements: 7-day Signal Request Thread, passing with 51%.  All MIP4c2 subproposals must use the template located at MIP4c3-Subproposal-Template.md.  MIP4c4: MIP Removal Process MIP4c4 is a Process MIP component that allows the removal of an Accepted MIP or set of MIPs. MIP4c4 subproposals have the following parameters:   Default Feedback Period: 3 months  Frozen Period: 1 month  Governance Cycle: Monthly  Other Requirements: None.  MIP4c3 subproposals must use the template located at MIP4c4-Subproposal-Template.md. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.
