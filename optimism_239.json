There was a sobering and yet very clarifying presentation by @haonan and @MSilb7 analyzing some key data. It\u2019s worth watching repeatedly. Here are some phrases that stood out:   \u201cOverall performance is mixed\u201d \u201cSome of the results may be unpleasant to look at\u201d \u201cDistribution has been slow\u201d \u201cBroadly ineffective\u201d \u201cWe can do much much better\u201d  Takeaways to consider during the upcoming Reflection Period: Make the gov fund more nimble, accountable, and clearly scoped.   Snapshot voting issues persist for some delegates. The Foundation is doing an analysis to figure out a \u201cdurable solution for the long run.\u201d   OP from grants cannot be sold to fund development or R&D. This violates the \u201cno sale\u201d guidance from the Foundation.   Delegates voting against Governance Committee recommendations: The original intention was to establish a kind of social contract between committees and delegates such that delegates would be comfortable deferring decision-making to the committees. If delegates (whether or not on a Governance Committee) dissent from a committee recommendation, they are expected to provide an explanation. If a dissenting delegate is on a Governance Committee, that explanation is expected to be more robust than otherwise.   \u201cNothing is perfect right now,\u201d but there are \u201cmany iterations\u201d ahead of us and \u201cwe really need to make sure we are treating each other with respect and empathy through the process,\u201d @bobby said in an eloquent moment of encouragement at the end of the call.   @Michael will be hosting the next call on November 8.

In case i estimate being eligible for RPGF2, could i nominate myself or it should be someone else to nominate for me?   Grant Season 3:   It will be great on the governance forum post related to this subject that recall the timeline: Publish application form on the forum, Application review, Voting I have also understood that this time small scale project could apply during this season, especially the ones related to Education & Awareness.

During the cycle, I wanted to contribute to proposal outside of my committee(DeFI & NFT ) but I was hesitant as this might seem like I am front running the dedicated committee ? This is my personal, what does the committee think about this ?   When giving delegate approval, shouldn\u2019t we also write our reasoning ? A single line statement, what did you like in the proposal?   New dedicated website (Discord link) should be mention on top of gov funding template so that the team submitting the proposal is aware of complete process. May be someone can improve this flowchart, they say a picture is worth a thousand words.   ",
