TL;DR \u2013 We\u2019re not opportunistic VCs. We\u2019re credit professionals and crypto natives. We\u2019re committed to helping Maker achieve its vision. BlockTower Credit will be requesting a $100MM DAI facility at a 4% stability fee to fund senior secured, real-world credit assets. As an institutional structured credit investment fund within one of crypto\u2019s most prominent asset management firms, we are committed to professionalizing Real World Asset (RWA) DeFi and proving the merits of distributed ledger technology to the world. Furthermore, we are uniquely situated to partner with Maker as an \u201carranger\u201d given our structural alignment with the protocol (BlockTower is a large MKR holder and active Maker governance member) and on each deal we facilitate (BlockTower stakes significant first-loss, junior capital on every deal). Right now, there is a historic opportunity in front of Maker and everyone in this community \u2013 one that we care deeply about and have the expertise to support. FYI - in the interest of decluttering this post, there are hyperlinks throughout. Please click in for more information. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? BlockTower Credit (\u201cBT\u201d) is an institutional investment fund, applying the skills of professional underwriting, structuring and investing at the intersection of real-world credit (a massive but anachronistic traditional industry) and crypto. BlockTower Credit is the credit franchise of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital asset and blockchain investment firm founded in 2017 by Ari Paul (CIO) and Matthew Goetz (CEO). The firm manages well over half a billion dollars and draws from decades in combined experience across professional investing and trading, early-stage venture capital, and credit. A more detailed firm overview can be found here BlockTower Credit manages a traditional asset-backed private credit strategy that primarily finances fintech and non-bank originators via senior secured debt facilities. The assets in our core credit portfolio are securitized through DeFi, proving DeFi\u2019s potential to transform the traditional credit markets and bridging real-world assets into the digital realm. We as a team, and BlockTower as a firm, are committed to ushering in this future and working with long-term partners to make it the world-changing reality it promises to be. This includes partners like Centrifuge, a protocol BlockTower has invested in, and the Maker community where we are long-time believers, large MKR token holders, and active governance participants (particularly where our expertise can be additive and useful to the community and its goals). Drawing on our significant experience investing across the public and private structured credit and whole loan markets, as well as our operational experience running early-stage fintech lenders, we have a competitive advantage in sourcing, underwriting, and investing in real-world credit assets. Cheap bank and insurance capital is generally unavailable in this market segment, leading to attractive risk-adjusted yields for professionals who can execute on these types of opportunities. The underlying credit assets are also generally shorter duration in nature (<2-3 years), an ideal investment profile for Maker\u2019s current stage of safe and scalable deployment into RWA. BlockTower Credit is led by seasoned credit investment professionals with experience running trading desks and credit strategies at leading institutions like Citigroup, Hildene Capital Management, Goldman Sachs, Capchase, and Axonic. BlockTower, the firm, also brings the support of ~30 professionals across investment, risk management, operations, legal and compliance, data science, and software development functions (and we\u2019re hiring - reach out if you\u2019re interested)! Biographies of BlockTower Credit\u2019s principals below: Ari Paul, Principal, Chief Investment Officer Ari Paul co-founded BlockTower Capital in 2017 and began his career in the financial services industry in 2006.

Jack earned a B.A. in philosophy and history (magna cum laude) from Colgate University. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token BlockTower Credit is the result of years of strategizing and building infrastructure and partnerships across the traditional credit and DeFi ecosystems. From the beginning, we believed Maker, and DeFi protocols like it, could play a critical role in scaling these endeavors. Serendipitously, Maker had already begun to leverage its unique position to finance RWA in novel and exciting ways. As we dove further into the assets and mechanics of the greenlit and proposed deals, Maker\u2019s ambition and competency was clear\u2026 but so too was the need for more professionalism amongst the proposals, counterparties, and structures. We intend to play a significant role in increasing that professionalism, both here within the Maker community and across DeFi more broadly (with Maker leading the way). BlockTower intends to position itself as an \u201carranger\u201d of stable, senior secured credit assets where we can leverage our network, scale, and expertise to underwrite and execute these investments. Additionally, we will leverage existing on-chain rails to deliver Maker DROP tokens via Centrifuge per MIP21/MIP22. We\u2019ve done significant work with Centrifuge to enhance the off-chain legal and operational infrastructure, building on the prior work of Centrifuge, New Silver, SocGen, and HVB. Leveraging those foundations, BlockTower is positioned to help Maker scale its RWA efforts professionally, transparently, and in an on-chain native way. A critical distinction between BlockTower Credit and others is the following: we are an institutional structured credit fund with significant expertise investing in this asset class professionally. This profile and pedigree is critical for a competent \u201carranger\u201d and should be a requisite to actively manage senior funding from Maker (at the community\u2019s will). BlockTower\u2019s active sourcing efforts and underwriting will help to rapidly scale Maker\u2019s RWA efforts while reducing the time spent and analytical strain placed on MKR CUs. More importantly, BlockTower is structurally aligned with Maker on every deal by committing significant first-loss capital. This enhances Maker RWA scalability and security by leaving day-to-day risk management decisions to BlockTower, while Maker\u2019s rights to the cash flows (and underlying assets) are encoded and enforceable by the Centrifuge DROP subscription agreement and smart contracts. Practically, this means that BlockTower would operate akin to a \u201cPortfolio Manager\u201d vs. \u201cOriginator\u201d of loans for Maker. This is ideal because unlike originators, who generate the bulk of their economics outside of the SPV that Maker has recourse to (i.e. origination fees, servicing fees, broker fees, etc), BlockTower\u2019s economics are driven by the performance of assets in the SPV. This means that, unlike an originator, we have every incentive to wind down poorly performing facilities early (whereas an originator has an incentive to continue selling assets into the SPV without consistent, enforceable monitoring by the lending party). Even more importantly, BlockTower is not a \u201ctransactional broker.\u201d On every asset that Maker finances, BlockTower will have significant skin in the game by providing subordinated, junior capital that provides credit enhancement to Maker\u2019s senior position. We do not make money by selling loans, without any residual exposure, into Maker\u2019s treasury. We make money the old-fashioned way: by picking great assets, structuring responsible deals, and taking the vast majority of the risk ourselves. We don\u2019t succeed unless Maker is also succeeding. All said, we know that this will continue to be a work-in-progress and we will engage in open discourse to improve every step of the way. In this spirit, the following concerns were distilled from reading every RWA Greenlight/Signal/MIP and the corresponding comments from the community. Our analysis of the key concerns and how BlockTower aims to alleviate them are below:     Concern Description Blocktower Approach     Perfection of Collateral Ensuring that assets in the SPV are unencumbered and DROP/TIN token holders can enforce their legal claim on those assets BT will file UCC-1/3 (or relevant filing) per the BT <> Originator loan agreement, with DROP/TIN subscription docs clearly effectuating claim on the underlying assets and cashflows   Servicing Assets Ensuring that cash makes it from end borrower <> SPV (USD to USD) and SPV <> Maker (USD to DAI) We will employ the approach proposed by Centrifuge and RWAC/HVB; likely using Genesis (and/or others) as the transfer agent for DAI <> fiat <> DAI   Protecting Maker\u2019s Interests as a Tokenholder Making sure that an arm\u2019s length party will ensure Maker\u2019s interests (as DROP note holder) are protected Indenture Trust (WSFS Bank in existing deals) as a trustee for DROP/TIN holders; in certain distressed situations, trustee will enforce noteholder rights (which govern DROP seniority over TIN).   Transparency (Oracle) Consistent monitoring of asset performance; necessary to ensure that private credit facilities are performing as expected given limited pricing transparency in secondary debt markets We will monitor asset performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. We\u2019ve made significant investments to build technology around this process [example asset report available upon request]   Principal Preservation/Asset Liquidation If performance suffers, there needs to be a reliable liquidation mechanism to protect Maker\u2019s DROP position As the junior position on every deal we bring to MKR, our economic decisions are driven by asset performance and ultimate recovery. BT will monitor collateral performance daily and is incentivized to trigger an event of default, acceleration, and/or liquidation if performance suffers   Technical Integration Some integrations (i.e. RWA D3M) will take significantly longer than anyone expects. This involves both technical integrations w/ Transfer or Exchange agents (i.e. Genesis), platforms like Centrifuge, or directly with a RWA arranger Beyond using Centrifuge\u2019s existing rails, BlockTower has significant institutional knowledge within DeFi and substantial technical resources at its disposal. We consider the latter resources for the MKR technical community, should they want it    We are certain this list is not exhaustive and look forward to building even more solutions going forward. Today, BlockTower has a pipeline of over $300MM in real-world credit opportunities, with our initial efforts geared toward shorter duration assets across consumer finance, tax receivables factoring, trade finance, and similar profiles. These assets exhibit \u201cquasi-liquidity\u201d through naturally occurring paydowns and the pools are homogenous in sizing, diversified in exposure, and have enough track record or proxies for performance to define delinquency and default curves across stressed situations. Beyond shorter duration assets, we have identified a number of asset pools and strategic parties across 1. commoditized credit assets (i.e. mortgages, unsecured consumer, auto loans, etc) and 2. green project finance through investors in BlockTower\u2019s family of funds, including ESG-focused HNW individuals, investment firms, and renewable energy operators. These assets require nuanced market understanding to accurately price due to 1. distorted TradFi markets (insurance/bank capital is artificially cheap for commoditized credit assets and tax incentives can do the same for ESG finance) and 2. significantly longer asset duration (upwards of 5-15 years). That being said, BlockTower has the flexibility and expertise to source and deliver these assets to the Maker community, provided it chooses to scale in this direction in the future. To pursue these investments, BlockTower Credit is targeting a $100MM DAI facility at a 4% stability fee for senior secured, asset-backed debt that fits mutually defined parameters between BT and the Maker community. Critically, all of Maker\u2019s exposure will have BlockTower Credit capital subordinating EVERY position, aligning our interests and insulating Maker from losses. We have every intention, as well as the human and financial resources necessary, to scale this partnership in much larger fashion going forward. That is our north star. Of course, this requires that we demonstrate exemplary performance and the community\u2019s continued interest in diversifying its asset base into productive, stable, and income-generating real-world assets. Thank you all for the time and consideration; we look forward to engaging with the community and listening to feedback. Additionally, the BlockTower Credit team is happy to field office hours around any and all topics (including our people, our investment strategy, and general education around the credit markets, assets, and structures). Please comment below if you\u2019re interested! Immediate Next Steps:  Engage community and MKR CUs for feedback Based on feedback, formalize MIP in the next ~1 week Kick off office hours sessions (if interest exists from community)  cc: @JackintheBlox @makeybakey @blockdataguy Additional points: Centrifuge Structural Considerations BlockTower strongly believes that diversified pools of credit assets, with cash flows tranched into senior risk profiles with credit enhancement, represent the ideal profile for Maker\u2019s forays into RWA. Furthermore, BT is fundamentally aligned with Centrifuge on its vision for the future of TradFi credit on DeFi rails. For those of you not familiar with securitizations, we\u2019ve created a primer here For those who are, we\u2019ve compared the economics and mechanics of TradFi securitizations with DeFi securitizations (via Centrifuge) here For the TDLR of the above two attachments, please reference the depiction below. This is an overview of how SPV risk is transferred over to the DROP and TIN tokens. Centrifuge Technical Analysis Centrifuge has a proven track record of bridging real world assets to the Maker ecosystem. The team has made significant progress with the Maker Foundation since the first mortgage pilot launched in 2019. At the time of writing, over 25M DAI has been issued across the four collateral asset types held within Maker vaults enabled by Centrifuge. BlockTower intends to build upon these early successes by leveraging the existing technology stack and integrations between Maker and Centrifuge. We have already begun to unpack the best practices and lessons learned from the New Silver collateral onboarding, and summarized our findings in the following case study. Centrifuge provides the technology to tokenize real-world assets, such as loans, as NFTs in a scalable and trustless manner. Furthermore, Centrifuge Tinlake is the securitization protocol that bundles assets and issues two the types of interest bearing ERC20 tokens, DROP and TIN tokens. Tinlake smart contracts ensure that holders of TIN tokens, the junior tranche, take first loss by executing a pro rata distribution to DROP token holders first, until fully repaid (principal plus interest), before distributing to TIN Token holders. Tinlake supports transparent reporting Nof the underlying assets by providing data regarding individual loan performance - outstanding balances, interest repayment, maturity dates, and more. Through MIP21 and MIP22, Centrifuge teams have already built a direct integration between Tinlake and Maker RWA vaults that address opening, drawing upon, reimbursing credit lines and handling liquidations. The smart contracts that underlie the Centrifuge and Tinlake platform have been security audited (see audit report here). A critical differentiating factor behind Centrifuge\u2019s platform is its ability to mirror a legal setup that enables recourse and a legal claim to the underlying assets. This is accomplished by aligning Centrifuge\u2019s modular smart contract architecture to a legal framework involving SPV\u2019s and an Indenture Trust. More information regarding the smart contract details and legal framing can be found in a previous community call walkthrough of the Tinlake smart contracts.

We should All recognized that BlockTower is not only a community member and MKR token owner, but is also leading by example here by taking on a Junior Tranche and  facilitating on the origination and structuring of loans for the benefit of MKR token owners. I also look forward to hearing more about the arrangement between Centrifuge and BlockTower. I  believe a lead syndicate between MakerDAO, BlockTower, and Centrifuge has infinite upside. And the awesome thing about is that All three (3) are innovative and are striving to take RWAs on-chain. What can be better than that.     humancapitol:  Ensuring that assets in the SPV are unencumbered and DROP/TIN token holders can enforce their legal claim on those assets   Can you please expand a bit more on the importance of how reputation plays a significant role in the syndicated loan market? Perhaps you can expand on how defaults by a lead arranger\u2019s borrowers can adversely affect its subsequent lending activity, and how that is consistent with a loss of reputation. I ask for you thoughts because I believe it\u2019s important for the MakerDAO community to understand that BlockTower is looking forward to constructing lead arranger functions that will set a precedence for future arranger standards and models.     humancapitol:  Cheap bank and insurance capital is generally unavailable in this market segment, leading to attractive risk-adjusted yields for professionals who can execute on these types of opportunities. The underlying credit assets are also generally shorter duration in nature (<2-3 years), an ideal investment profile for Maker\u2019s current stage of safe and scalable deployment into RWA.

Would this be fixed, and if so, for how long? If variable, do you have some benchmarks in mind? If going the variable route, it would be interesting to see benchmarks that @NikKunkel could provide a low-cost oracle for to automatically adjust rates up and down over some reasonable measurement period. Experience with an early vault that has an agreed-upon floating rate has shown that manual resetting simply should not be relied upon. Do you envision this as a single vault for Blocktower, or potentially divided into different buckets, each with differing terms or requirements? What level of junior capital is Blocktower generally thinking? Assuming this works as intended, can Blocktower also be \u201ccontracted\u201d to originate a portfolio desired by MakerDAO similar to what Monetalis is doing?

Perhaps you can expand on how defaults by a lead arranger\u2019s borrowers can adversely affect its subsequent lending activity, and how that is consistent with a loss of reputation. I ask for you thoughts because I believe it\u2019s important for the MakerDAO community to understand that BlockTower is looking forward to constructing lead arranger functions that will set a precedence for future arranger standards and models.  Reputation, in most lending functions, is critical to obtaining new funding, continuing old funding, or lowering your cost of capital. At the consumer level, this is generally quantified through FICO. On an institutional borrower level, no such metric exists (with any signal, at least). Ultimately, however, BlockTower is not lending against reputation (unsecured), we\u2019re lending against a pool of assets with predictable cash flows, the perfection of security (i.e. we legally own those cashflows or assets securing the cashflows), strict eligibility covenants (that we define), and this reduces the reliance on reputation as an input for creditworthiness. In addition, the lending businesses that we back (by purchasing the loans they create), are dependent on outside capital to continue operating. If they are in default to BlockTower, it won\u2019t be only reputation that restricts them from finding new capital partners (an existential risk) - it will be legal safeguards from our structured agreements, in the form of exclusivity and facility curing, that will do so. It\u2019s also important to note that our lending exposure is not to the originators themselves; it\u2019s to the assets that rest in a bankruptcy-remote SPV and less driven by the health of the business that is originating loans.  As we all know duration does have limitations (interest rate outlook always change), can you please expand how BlockTower expects to adjust and manage duration risk as a lead arranger? Maybe you can walk us through positive duration, and \u201cnegative\u201d duration scenarios (if possible).  You are entirely correct - at BlockTower, we don\u2019t pretend to have high conviction on the interest rate flight path. To mitigate the impact of rate volatility, BlockTower invests in assets that are generally uncorrelated to broader interest rates. Shorter duration assets, i.e. our target assets, are also [mathematically less exposed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duration.asp#:~:text=Duration is a measure of,are also calculated in years.)) to interest rate volatility (on a mark-to-market basis). From a principal protection perspective, we do not expect interest rate volatility to impact principal recoveries. This is particularly true at the super senior level of Maker\u2019s exposure (i.e. DROP tranches), given the level of credit enhancement provided through BlockTower\u2019s capital (TIN tranches) and/or originator equity Given the nature of our investments, we have limited duration exposure on a mark-to-market basis. In general, however, positive and negative duration scenarios are very asset and price-dependent. For example, lower interest rates on mortgages generally lead to higher prepayment rates (i.e. shortening the effective duration of the assets). This can be IRR positive if the assets are priced at a discount to par (i.e. the assets pull to par more quickly, enhancing IRR) or negative if the assets are priced at a premium to par (i.e. the premium pricing is due to higher-than-market interest rates, and reducing the effective duration of your exposure to those above market rates is negative for your IRR because you must reinvest into a lower-yielding environment). Again, this example is illustrative and not highly relevant for the shorter-duration, par-assets that we intend to securitize on-chain and partner to fund with Maker.  Blocktower is offering a 4% stability fee. Would this be fixed, and if so, for how long? If variable, do you have some benchmarks in mind? If going the variable route, it would be interesting to see benchmarks that @NikKunkel could provide a low-cost oracle for to automatically adjust rates up and down over some reasonable measurement period. Experience with an early vault that has an agreed-upon floating rate has shown that manual resetting simply should not be relied upon.  The proposed rate was set to be more competitive vs. existing proposals, especially when considering the 1) shorter duration nature of our assets and 2) BlockTower\u2019s junior capital risked to protect Maker\u2019s senior position. Our investment landscape today is generally priced on a fixed level; therefore, we\u2019d generally be seeking a fixed stability fee from Maker. We are open to feedback (and irrespective, we are happy to work with Maker to onboard oracles for use going forward). The relevant benchmark would likely be SOFR, which the broader structured finance industry has transitioned over to over the past 1-2 years.  Do you envision this as a single vault for Blocktower, or potentially divided into different buckets, each with differing terms or requirements?  For operational ease (and using precedence set by the HVB transaction), we envision this as a single vault; this is a far more scalable option for Maker to generate DAI backed by RWA. Like HVB, the deployment of funds would be subject to predetermined parameters between Maker CUs, the community, and BlockTower. Each vault, however, per MIP21/22 would appear separately because they are distinct pools of collateral/SPVs in Centrifuge. The purpose for housing these assets in separate SPVs is to not comingle Maker\u2019s senior exposure across multiple different originators and asset classes. In a comingled senior scenario, Maker\u2019s senior exposure in performing assets would be at risk from 1 poor asset. By following our approach, with each different asset exposure in discrete SPVs, this contagion would not be a risk.  What level of junior capital is Blocktower generally thinking?  We are generally looking to place at least 30% of junior capital into every Centrifuge structure. This is in addition, and subject to, the originator equity that subordinates both Maker\u2019s senior and BlockTower\u2019s junior position (see diagram here). We are open to additional comment here but believe this is extremely conservative relative to existing former and existing proposals.  Assuming this works as intended, can Blocktower also be \u201ccontracted\u201d to originate a portfolio desired by MakerDAO similar to what Monetalis is doing?  100%; we view Maker as a customer and are capable and willing to originate a separate, unique portfolio desired by MakerDAO.
