                    "content": " Brief Summary QiDao wants to partner with MakerDAO to increase the amount of DAI on Optimism via Velodrome bribes from QiDao. This proposal was made in partnership with MakerDAO\u2019s Growth Core Unit.  TL;DR on Issue MakerDAO is currently using its voting power to vote for DAI/USDC and DAI/OP LP rewards on Optimism. No other protocol is voting for or bribing those LPs. As a result, the amount of DAI locked on Velodrome has stagnated (see chart below).  840\u00d7342 36.7 KB                         DAI liquidity on Velodrome   TL;DR on Proposed Partnership The way liquidity works on Solidly-like DEXs, you do much better when you partner with others. MakerDAO can increase the amount of votes to DAI by 64.24% by allocating votes to DAI-MAI instead of just DAI-USDC. Below is the proposed voting distribution. Before:  DAI-USDC: 100% of votes  After:  DAI-USDC: 60% of votes DAI-MAI: 40% of votes  Overall votes to DAI stable LPs are expected to increase by 2M, which represents a 64% increase. See chart below for breakdown.   Solution Details QiDao has started a trial bribing exercise to see how many votes it can attract to a MAI-DAI LP. During the first vote, 1.8M votes were collected. This is expected to stabilize to 2M votes as bribes continue. Here\u2019s how it would work if Maker and QiDao partnered on the pool:  QiDao bribes MAI-DAI pool with $1,000 / week Maker votes for the MAI-DAI pool with its VELO Maker recycles the bribes received from QiDao. This increases the overall pool\u2019s bribes The pool now receives more votes than it would if Maker just voted for a pool. And more than if QiDao bribed the pool alone  ",
