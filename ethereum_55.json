Give an use case, such as in advertisement industry, they can take NFTs as the medium of promotion, and put advertisement as an attachment on NFTs. It has that potential to impact if it grows as a standard. If anyone else would like to add their thoughts, please reply in the post. Let\u2019s get this moving forward. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @IronMan_CH - this is a great initiative that also allows intraoperability within the same blockchain, allowing 3rd parties to add their own metadata to the NFT. I have a question however - what\u2019s the rationale behind making authorization a MUST by including it as part of the standard? Since I don\u2019t see the risk of the usual DDoS due to data growing out of control, because the way to access that data is also providing the address of the slot setter. In the interest of decentralization I see this as an opportunity for web3 projects to immortalize NFTs from dead projects by giving them a second wind, in the form of metadata updates specific to 3rd party players. This is a revised simplified reference implementation based on that: simplified-IERC5489/ERC5489.sol at main \u00b7 bfondevila/simplified-IERC5489 \u00b7 GitHub Such a pity that I saw this EIP so late! But potentially could submit a simplified proposal as another EIP. ",

It certainly has a need for that specific use case of using an NFT as a billboard, but the foundation of it could still be permissionless (if we talk exclusively about NFT hyperlink extension). Based on your answer I do see the need for two standards - a permissionless one that allows for fully decentralized NFT hyperlinking, and a permission based one that could be used by external operators such as an exchange. I\u2019ll join the discord and discuss it further with the team, thanks for your response! ",
