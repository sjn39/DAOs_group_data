We aim to create tools for creators, so they can easily interact, collaborate, and produce content for web3. Using blockchain technology we can track where the files are going and how they are being used.** Applicants can come from all creative categories and intellectual pillars: fashion, music, design, architecture, technology, art, film, animation, gaming, VR/AR, sustainability, and so on. Young Creatives play a critical role in creating culture, driving innovation, and building wealth \u2013 particularly in marginalized communities. Yet, we know that Creatives who are women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ+ communities face distinct challenges that stem from systems, structures, and practices designed to exclude and preclude them from being successful. Without the ability to invest their own wealth, the result is that businesses owned by entrepreneurs from these communities are overleveraged or are unable to access capital to invest in growth. \u200b We have established a Curation Committee (+50 curators at this moment) and would love to add strategic curators from the Optimism eco-system as well.
