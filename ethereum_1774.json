Each partial order as well as each equivalence relation needs to be transitive.   debtChain1920\u00d71080 155 KB  Let\u2019s say Alice owes to Bob, and Bob owes to Susan. When Alice wants to payback, can do it directly to Susan, bypassing Bob, and requiring no extra effort to Bob, except an initial consent on being part of such transitivity on blockchain. As Bob secures potential future collections, in fact Alice becomes one of those potential partials in Bob\u2019s pool, for Susan and others to collect from what Bob owe to. My concern, and need for improvement, is around assuring a person not giving up their universal, basic needs. Maybe the amount that Alice sends, should first check if Bob will be able to pay their rent, food, pocket money, etc\u2026 needs, then complete the transaction. If real-time is not desired, could just send it to an account where Bob\u2019s such accumulations are staked in the collectors\u2019 name, for the future transactions,  eg. when total amount is made.  let me know how and when one numbers a potential EIP or a focused work/stuff like this    bests, in peace ",
