                    "content": "Project Name: BeethovenX, powered by Balancer Author Name: Solarcurve (BalancerDAO contributor, BeethovenX advisor) Number of OP tokens requested: 500,000 L2 Recipient Address: 0x2a185C8A3C63d7bFe63aD5d950244FFe9d0a4b60 Relevant Usage Metrics: Balancer has ~$1.4B TVL and does ~$500M volume per week. This is the network OP incentives would be competing in through the veBAL gauge vote. Currently on OP we have ~$4.8M TVL, ~$500k daily volume, ~$3-4k daily fees,  ~2k daily tx\u2019s. Balancer & BeethovenX have allocated $500k of incentives over 8 weeks towards Optimism so we could launch as soon as possible, which we did on June 2nd (https://op.beets.fi/). Optimism will soon be integrated into the veBAL gauge system and we will need to secure votes for Optimism pools to earn BAL emissions. Optimism alignment Both Balancer and BeethovenX view Optimism as one of the most promising scaling solutions - not only because of the world class technology but also the entire vision of the Optimism Collective. This has the potential to create a narrative beyond simply making money which is incredibly exciting. We view Optimism as the perfect foundation upon which to build the world\u2019s most advanced decentralized exchange. BeethovenX, in collaboration with Balancer, will roll out cutting edge technology on Optimism such as Boosted Pools and Managed Pools. The goal is to build an unparalleled UX that puts the full power of Balancer technology in the hands of all Optimism users and projects. We are here for the long term. As you\u2019ll read below we have an innovative plan to create a positive flywheel that can continue to drive BAL emissions to Optimism through the veBAL gauges even after external incentives, like this proposal is requesting, are exhausted. BeethovenX is sacrificing half of their share of protocol revenues towards this flywheel precisely because of the belief that the long term benefits will be worth far more. Proposal for token distribution How will the OP tokens be distributed? OP will likely be used to bribe in veBAL gauges for pools on Optimism, primarily boosted pools. Boosted pools are liquidity pools that only keep a small amount of tokens on hand for trading and send the rest to earn yield on Aave, Yearn, or similar platforms. Balancer was the first DEX to launch liquidity mining back in mid-2020 and many large holders of BAL are strong believers in the Ethereum (and Optimism) ethos. It is reasonable to expect many veBAL voters to hold onto the OP they stand to earn from bribes, and future improvements like adding L2 boosts will provide further incentive alignment. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Bribing is on average ~3x more cost effective (based on recent veBAL history) compared to traditional liquidity mining. With this strategy we can efficiently bootstrap AMM liquidity on Optimism AND lending markets like Aave simultaneously. However, if the ROI on bribing decreases to the point where it is a higher ROI to match OP 1:1 in traditional liquidity mining we retain the option to do that. In any case, OP will always be matched 1:1 in $ value. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? While we expect that boosted pools and future technology like managed pools will see strong interest even without external incentives, we also plan to pioneer methods of sustainable incentives that will persist after all OP incentives are exhausted. We will be directing 25% of the protocol fees earned on Optimism towards bribing for the pools that generated those fees (or as direct incentives on those pools). That means activity stimulated by external incentives would directly lead to higher bribes \u2192 more veBAL votes \u2192 more BAL emissions \u2192 more TVL \u2192 more trading activity, etc. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We can\u2019t place a timeframe on distribution as that is directly related to the fees generated by the protocol. How much will your project match in co-incentives? The agreement between BeethovenX and Balancer stipulated that the protocol fee of 50% would be split 50/50. BeethovenX will be directing half of their fee earnings towards matching OP incentives for the pools that generated those fees, either through bribes or direct liquidity mining. For example, if Balancer on Optimism generated $400k in protocol fees for this month then BeethovenX would be entitled to $200k. Half of that ($100k) would be matched with $100k of OP and allocated towards incentives on Optimism pools. Beyond this, BeethovenX has already allocated up to 3M BEETS for bribing for Optimism pools that we will use at our discretion. This is in addition to the match proposed above. These 3M BEETS will be used to kick start the flywheel described above through an early and aggressive bribing campaign. ",

We expect to complete integration into the veBAL voting system in a month or so, at which point we will begin bribing with protocol fees + BEETS + hopefully OP. We invite all projects on Optimism that need token liquidity to consider parking it with us, the benefit being the fees your pool earns will be used to bribe for BAL emissions. This costs your project nothing! Far better than spending OP incentives on Uniswap liquidity that will disappear as soon as the incentives stop flowing. The more fees your pool generates, the more BAL emissions you\u2019ll get.  We\u2019ll also be supporting the rollout of yield bearing tokens like wstETH and bringing boost pools to Optimism over the next month or two. I\u2019m very excited about the next few months! ",

Balancer is a top protocol on Ethereum with a community that is willing to leave liquidity in their pools for optimal yield management. We see value in incentivizing some of the money on Eth l1 & Fantom to flow to Optimism and we like your approach to kickstarting your Optimism deployment and veBal emissions. Fyi, we are not the biggest fans of multiple layers of farming protocols to distribute revenues (bribing) and rather believe core protocols and their holders should manage revenue distribution with their long-term alignment and views.

This kind of behavior doesn\u2019t go unnoticed in corporate America and for good reason. AFAIK Optimism TVL is hurting and is down about 40% from ATHs and nothing seems to be changing here. Doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see quite simply: Need more protocols and distribution of incentives to encourage bringing more people to L2.  I did spend some significant time, having read every single other protocol\u2019s proposal put forth, putting together a proposal myself that oddly enough was immediately pushed back on by @solarcurve and then cited a Proposal literally published by himself as the \u201cright\u201d way to make a Proposal. I really believe in the Optimistic Vision still but the reality is that if the intent here is to keep aspiring protocols, looking to come and build here,  out of Optimism - as opposed to the stated purpose of providing incentives to bootstrap growth, it\u2019s logical to form the conclusion that the experiment that is Optimism does not end well. And more important; I think anyone taking the time to read through these forums is already demonstrating precisely who we all want to be in alignment with.  My point being work together. I think cooperation and collaboration is the answer right now. ",

Our grant proposal allows us only to spend the grant money if we can match it with protocol fees. We wanted to give back to the Optimism ecosystem so we decided to see if we could take things a step further. We have achieved this by using our protocol fees to buy $OP tokens on the open market. This enabled us to do the matching on a token level. As of today, we have spent a net of 71k $OP tokens, which has been an important part of maintaining our TVL at around the $19m mark. We are very proud of how efficient this strategy has been in terms of $OP spent. Below is a detailed breakdown of the activity.  Some partner protocols asked us to distribute their $OP grant on their behalf, which is included in both the inflow and outflow.
