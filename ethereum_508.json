He starts by proposing EEP-1, a workflow for network participants on how to roll out consensus upgrades onto the Ethereum mainnet reliably and reproducibly.   github.com   karalabe/eee/blob/master/eeps/eep-1.md --- EEP:     1 Title:   Consensus update rollout Authors: P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi <peter@ethereum.org> Status:  Draft Version: 2018-11-06 Discuss: ---  *Ethereum is a mission critical system, the long-term sustainability of which requires strict engineering practices over rock-star development. Part of that effort is ensuring we have well defined processes that all ecosystem participants understand, agree with and adhere to. Everyone hates checklists, but Ethereum will only reach its potential if we can regulate it with the gravity of flight engineering.*  *All amendments to this standardized workflow must be rationalized via real world failures, which must be included for future reference to avoid regressions. When adding a new item, please also include an inline explanation to help newcomers.*  ## Abstract  The goal of this document is to act as a step-by-step guide for network participants on how to roll out consensus upgrades onto the Ethereum network in a reliable and reproducible fashion. It defines the timelines and deliverables different teams must follow, as well as the emergency procedures in case something foreseeable goes wrong.  The scope of this document is *not* the specification, implementation and preparation of forks, rather their safe rollout once the ecosystem gives the green light on deploying them.  ## Preconditions     This file has been truncated. show original      Related to this topic are recent posts about the disorderly Constantinople-related fork on Ropsten:     Issues we discovered in the Ropsten Constantinople hard fork Process Improvement       Here\u2019s my initial post-mortem and concern/task list following the Constantinople Ropsten hard fork, in no particular order.    A consensus bug in Parity was discovered (https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9746). We need to understand why this consensus bug occurred in the first place, and particularly why it wasn\u2019t caught by the tests. @ethchris suggests that we may need clearer EIP specs including pseudo code (https://twitter.com/ethchris/status/1052503731072315392). Apparently i\u2026         Disorderly Constantinople fork on Ropsten testnet Signaling Ring       This case brings up interesting developer coordination issues and illustrates the importance of a well-defined testing process as client developers prepare to implement changes affecting mainnet.  In this planned activation of changes on Ropsten testnet, when the forking block was reached, there was not enough mining power from Ropsten clients implementing Constantinpole changes. This led to a disorderly forking in which the intended upgraded network failed to quickly materialize / become domina\u2026         A case to study: proposed Constantinople-related fork on Ropsten Signaling Ring       Context: AllCoreDevs meetings notes #47 on Fri, September 28, 2018   \u201cGeth, Parity, aleth, ethereumj, mana, nethermind - completed implementation of all EIPs\u201d  \u201cwe should probably pick a block number today for testnet fork\u201d  \u201cLet\u2019s go with Ropsten block 4.2M, that puts us at this time in 11 days, on Oct. 9\u201d   Certain client development stakeholders wanted to activate forking changes / Constantinople in order to identify possible consensus bugs and reduce risks for when these changes are activate\u2026     ",
