The creators of SourceCred are working with this group to put together a plan of action in how SourceCred can be most effectively used for this community. The working group is aware that this trial will require sign-off from the community before being put into practice, rest assured that if there is widespread objection once the trial plan has been presented, it will not be put into action. Why is it happening? Despite some misgivings, several people have seen potential in the SourceCred algorithm to help to solve problems of incentivisation and participation in the Maker community. Who is involved? @LongForWisdom created the working group with the blessing of @rich.brown and has reached out to members of SourceCred (@s_ben, @decentralion @Beanow) who have agreed to work with us on this trial. Additionally, @charlesstlouis and @rawhaus have independently expressed interest in SourceCred and have joined the working group. When should we expect results? This is very early days at this point. I would not expect results for some time yet (months not weeks.) I will update this post when a more concrete timeline has been determined.  Update: The initial forum post explaining the trial has now been posted to the forum, and can be found here: Maker SourceCred Trial ",

Full disclosure, I\u2019m a SourceCred contributor helping Maker explore a trial. SourceCred has a feature in production that allows you to have a unified identity across platforms. Currently, it\u2019s based on usernames. If you have one username on one platform (e.g. Discourse), and another username on a different platform (e.g. GitHub), you just need to edit a JSON file that maps the identities. E.g. here\u2019s the JSON file for SourceCred. As for tying an identity on Discourse to an MKR address, that does open up some interesting possibilities. Certainly something we could explore. ",

Is this automatic, ie everyone on Discourse is added, is there a registration interface, or is it manually updated? I think the best UX would be everyone participant in a community is automatically included and starts accruing cred naturally.   This is indeed how it works. Currently just using Discourse public APIs to pull all public content into a database and analyzing it. Everyone is included automatically.     dawson:  Have you considered using public proofs to ensure linked accounts are owned by the same individual?

I could do the same on Github by posting a Gist, or for a crypto address by signing a message with wallet key and posting it. (This is loosely how Keybase  does public proofs)   Identity resolution is a deep topic. I know the devs have discussed this a lot, and could probably tell you more about future plans. For this trial, I believe we\u2019re just using Discourse. Therefore we\u2019re relying on Discourse authentication at the platform level, and human validation at the social level (i.e. we\u2019ll be monitoring scores and activity as part of supporting the trial). Since the number of regular Discourse contributors with significant cred scores is relatively low, this should not be a problem. As SourceCred scales, tackling larger and larger communities, and cred goes on-chain, solutions like the ones you\u2019re suggesting will be necessary.     dawson:  Also curious, where is the weight of an individual in a given community displayed? Or how is reputation / cred used in a community?   In the tread that started it all, I posted some initial cred scores for this Discourse and the mcd-cdp-portal GitHub repo. There you can see a hosted instance with default weights and a UI that shows cred per contributor over time. How reputation/cred is used in a community is up to that community:) In SourceCred, we pay contributors by cred score. In other communities, it could be just one input to a compensation or governance mechanism. Or something else entirely.     dawson:  Is this something I could display on my GitHub profile, or could this be used to automatically label MRs and prioritize MRs of people with more cred in a community?   A SourceCred contributor recently made a GitHub action actually that can generate contributor graphics based on cred scores.  We\u2019ve been investigating \u2018cred weighted voting\u2019 for our internal governance. Lots of potential applications there. As for prioritizing certain work, we are planning on rolling out a feature called boosting, which creates prediction markets on contributions. But I don\u2019t want to derail\u2026won\u2019t be in prod in time for a Maker trial.     Andy_McCall:  As far as verifying onchain identities go idk how much research has been done in this area, so you might be able to get away with rolling your own solution? There seems to be the DIF which seems interested in solving this problem, but I haven\u2019t read enough documentation to say whether or not that is a good fit.   Incorporating on-chain identity and actions into the UI is on the roadmap for 2020, but for now we\u2019re just focusing on improving the cred scores.     dawson:  Sorry the barrage of questions but I think this is a pretty interesting idea and am really curious    Happy to answer!

Long-term, the goal (afaik) is for contributors to be paid directly by the protocol. That raises a whole host of issues though, and I am out of my depth there. I am generally excited by that possibility though, as Maker has a lot of the base level technical and governance infrastructure set up already. ",

                    "content": "    Andy_McCall:  One of my big open questions here is how does maker prevent cred from being some worthless token that I have? \u2026 Are there going to be mechanisms for me to sell my cred? Why would anyone want to buy it? Is the protocol setting aside dai to be distributed to cred holders?   Cred actually isn\u2019t a token at all, and there isn\u2019t any way to buy or sell it. Cred is a representation of how much value a person has added to a project; thus it\u2019s both identity-specific and constantly updating. You can\u2019t sell your cred any more than Newton could sell his cred for coming up with Newtonian mechanics. In the full SourceCred cryptoeconomic system, cred is just one part of it. The other key piece is grain, a cred-based token. The idea is that every project can issue its own grain (e.g. Maker-grain). Grain is distributed directly to contributors, but can be bought by project sponsors. Grain thus acts as a \u201cproof of support\u201d \u2013 everyone who has it either supported the project by contributing directly, or by buying grain from another supporter. The key privilege that Grain will confer is the ability to modify the cred graph, by \u201cboosting\u201d contributions, which increases their cred scores. Having a lot of grain thus gives a sponsor the ability to incentivize contributions that they care about. If you want to learn more about this in depth, I recommend this talk that I gave at Web3 Summit at ETHDenver a few weeks ago: SourceCred: A Social Algorithm. It also gives an overview of how cred calculations work, and addresses a lot of common concerns and questions about making the system robust to gaming. In the specific case of a Maker pilot trial, we might leave grain out of the picture and just distribute Maker. Ultimately it\u2019s up to what you as a community, and the Maker Foundation, think is appropriate\u2013SourceCred is happy to support your experiment either way.  ",

There will be no added mechanism to influence governance, it is simply the awarding of MKR to people who are contributors? ",

This is all still at the early stages though, and the final proposal may shift (e.g. perhaps Maker decides to reward contributors in DAI instead). If the working group decides to move forward, a document clearly explaining the parameters of the trial will be presented, and as @LongForWisdom mentioned in the above post, if there is widespread objection, it will not be put into action.
