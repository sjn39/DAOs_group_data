Tim: Ideally, we never \"reach\" this difficulty bomb because we've merged before. But, if we haven't, I think it's better to have to push it back again. The alternatives are (1) remove the bomb altogether, which I don't think we should do (makes it easier for the PoW chain to keep going, also to launch scam forks) or (2) push the bomb *way* back, which is sort of equivalent to removing it in this context.  The Difficulty bomb was introduced has a mean to strongly incentivize the Ethereum community to switch to PoS. The difficulty bomb schedules a network slowdown when its deadline is missed. The network suffered from previous bombs:  Blocktime went up to ~30s before EIP-649 came to the rescue Blocktime went up to ~20s before EIP-1234 saved the day Blocktime went up to ~17s before EIP-2387 cut the right wire Blocktime wasn\u2019t impacted as EIP-3554 pushed back the bomb even started ticking  This EIP is proposing to diffuse and delay the bomb for the 5th time. I assume no one would argue that the 4 previous intervention were not justified, the readiness of the switch to PoS was miles away from what it is today. I assume that, with the state of the network today, having even 0.1 sec more delay between blocks would greatly impact the user experience (transaction fees likely going to the roof). Nevertheless, I am concerned that removing all together or delaying the bomb again would arm the credibility of the Merge. If the Merge is close to ready, if we start to tease on social media that tests of merge from clients is going well, let\u2019s the just not delay and do the Merge. ",

If the Merge is close to ready, if we start to tease on social media that tests of merge from clients is going well, let\u2019s the just not delay and do the Merge.   I think this is the crux of things. Even though the merge testing is going well, it isn\u2019t going to happen until the difficulty bomb is due to go off again (early December, as per EIP-3554). We are not ~1 month away from having client releases ready for the merge, so we need to push the bomb back again. I used this value as a rough proxy of when I think we could ship the merge if everything goes relatively well. If things didn\u2019t go well, then we\u2019d have to push the bomb back again. Obviously the EIP is still a draft and the specific time will need to be discussed further.     jdetychey:  I assume that, with the state of the network today, having even 0.1 sec more delay between blocks would greatly impact the user experience (transaction fees likely going to the roof).   That\u2019s a fair point. In the EIP, I assume that ~1 sec is what starts to be significant for UX impact, but I could be wrong here. If you think that even a 0.1 sec is very bad, then we can push back the block to target a 0.1 sec delay happening after we think the merge would realistically happen. ",
