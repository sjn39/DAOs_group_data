One thing too is that a topic discussion usually happens under the context of the \u201cEIPs\u201d category (and there is no way to have more than one category for a topic). It is actually the EIPs category which is less useful, because w/ the tagging and the title w/ EIP-XYZ anyone can find EIP-related topics.

Here are a few comments on your comments      jpitts:  I would argue to keep Primordial Soup, this is useful for when new proposals show up pre-EIP stage. But this could be better positioned i.e. what are general discussions, and what could potentially become an EIP some day.   My view on this is that the categories themselves are sufficient here. If someone has a rough idea about the merge, they can just make a post in the Merge subcategory directly, for example. EthMagicians already has an aura of \u201cplace where you can bring up semi-formalized proposals\u201d, so I\u2019m not sure another \u201clayer\u201d is needed. Weakly held opinion, though!     jpitts:  Overall this could be broadened to mean \u201cHappenings\u201d, with subcategories \u201cCommunity Calls\u201d, \u201cIn-Person Councils\u201d, \u201cEvents\u201d   Yep, I like that!     jpitts:  One thing too is that a topic discussion usually happens under the context of the \u201cEIPs\u201d category (and there is no way to have more than one category for a topic).   I think that\u2019s fine: when things are EIPs they can move from the Working Groups category to EIPs. This is why I\u2019d remove the \u201cPrimordial Soup\u201d category.     jpitts:  It is actually the EIPs category which is less useful, because w/ the tagging and the title w/ EIP-XYZ anyone can find EIP-related topics. Perhaps we should emphasize the use of general subjects under working groups and remove EIPs.   Hmm interesting! I\u2019d be a bit cautious about removing EIPs because most of the \u201cdiscussion-to\u201d links from EIPs point here. It\u2019s a nice place to aggregate them. Also, if we remove it, then someone may not know what category to put their discussion to link in and it may lead to less stuff being posted here, which is not great. ",

It is \u201cone category, and everything else just use tags\u201d, and I haven\u2019t found a plugin or anything which can change this behavior. I do like the idea of eliminating some hierarchy, particularly in \u201cworking groups\u201d, and also removing the term \u201crings\u201d from titles and the whole notion that there are \u201cworking groups\u201d for simplicity. image1174\u00d7332 27.2 KB And this brings me to an idea: how about we move these working groups to be under EIPs instead, ensuring that everything EIP-ish is captured by the links that @timbeiko referred to and also that they can all have proper categorization as to subject matter. Core EIPs and last call are relegated to tags. EIPs basically becomes a catch-all for any proposal work being done here on the forum, implicitly encouraging any discussions under a technical subject leading to the creation of an EIP. I\u2019ll also check to see if EIPs and other categories can be routed to a tag if we decide to remove categories / flatten it all out as @vbuterin has proposed. ",

Regarding Working groups (Rings initially) , we noticed that Working groups are not a thing anymore and the forum has evolved over time significantly as the Ethereum did too. We wanted to announce diminishing Rings (now Working Groups) which they evolved into a real projects (many projects started initially on Ethereum Magicians forum) or those WGs (Rings) dissolved over time. The forum is now more focused on EIPs and less on Working groups and people working on different topics (like wallets, UX\u2026). Regarding Categories and keeping up forum up to date: \u201cPrimodial soup\u201d - This is for topics that don\u2019t have it\u2019s own category and authors of the posts are not sure which category it should be under.

As for the merge category, I think The Merge rolls off the tongue better than \u201cMainnet-to-Beacon Chain Merge\u201d, especially given we are trying to use the terms \u201ceth1\u201d and \u201ceth2\u201d less.

The initial work to create the new top-level categories, migrate some Working Groups, and begin to move Core EIPs \u2192 EIPs is nearly complete. I am starting to think that any \u201cinitiative\u201d with a deadline, etc. should continue to be under Working Groups. But we should try to keep WGs to a minimum, only groups active in the last 6 months. One reason for this is Eth1.x, this is still active and there may be links to the \u201cWorking Groups / Eth1.x\u201d topic search URL. Next steps:  Create the archive for inactive WGs Begin to categorize old topics under \u201cprimordial soup\u201d and \u201cuncategorized\u201d so they fall under the new \u201cTop-level categories of discussions and pre-EIP work\u201d  ",
