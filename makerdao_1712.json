It seems that, by definition, most bonuses are \u201ctied to a specific outcome\u201d - particularly in the case of a success bonus. In the corporate context, KPIs (corporate and individual) are often the triggers for an employee\u2019s bonus. Corporate officers get paid bonuses based on specific corporate outcomes.

In response, I have always viewed my role within Maker as being more than an \u201cevaluator\u201d (notwithstanding inaccurate perceptions of entanglement and gate-keeping). I think if you see the work that @teej and I perform in structuring a transaction for the benefit of Maker token holders, it is simply more than \u201cevaluation\u201d. If it was merely an \u201cevaluation\u201d, we would not be as involved in providing guidance on commercial, legal and other points. While some may not like the term, we are in effect \u201cnegotiating\u201d . . . otherwise MIP6 applicants will be encouraged to submit a take-or-leave it proposal. There is substantial behind the scenes work to improve the bare-bones offering that is typically a MIP6. We are probably no different than any deal team that has to report to a higher body. And not to unnecessarily re-hash raise an old issue, but the purpose of LOVE was to in effect monitor the deal team. But I agree with you, if the role is simply \u201cevaluation\u201d, then there is not any merit in a bonus. ",

                    "content": "Hi all. This is not my deal so I can\u2019t comment on the particulars. What I will comment on is an approach I would like to see for clarity sake. RWA deals are complex and involve a variety of parties. In the past, we\u2019ve mixed some roles meaning, multiple people doing related tasks where in many environments, we would have separated the work. I think everyone\u2019s intention is honorable and as we move more to a metadao structure, we\u2019re having to work with ambiguity and a bias towards action. What I would suggest is to list the roles/responsibilities to what Mark has identified in the scope. Let\u2019s be clear on who is doing what then have the discussion. I think a key issue is the tension between deal execution and providing risk/legal opinions. If we need to separate this, let\u2019s do it and move on so we can focus on what is important\u2026onboarding collateral to generate profits. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as ensuring @christiancdpetersen is paid a normal fee and @teej gets a bonus for getting the deal over the line. What I think we need to prepare for as a community is the reality of a protector metadao. I\u2019ve had to spend more time than I would have liked on this over the past week. From my learnings, the protectors are going to assume the risk for doing deals. Today, we don\u2019t have the structure (incentive/disincentive) setup so the protector feels the reward/pain but we need to prepare for this reality. In the near future, it would be common to have the facilitator, arranger, legal, executors, etc. all working closely together to move deals through the system. For now, the community might feel better to separate these functions. Let\u2019s just be aligned on who is doing what and move forward. ",

It would be nice to have other human eyes in particularly, the Risk Assessment.   BlockTower had previously agreed, subject to a defined scope of work, to cover any additional external legal review required by Maker. In this regard, I have contacted a firm to run conflicts (conflicts is cleared), I have not yet asked for a quote as the scope of work is still being defined.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Also, can MKR token owners get a guaranteed delivery of services within the 3-month period, and an extension of work without being charged if there are delays in work/reviews not being delivered, Force Majeure unforeseen events, or delays in the MakerDAO Governance process.   A question of \u201cforce majeure\u201d to a energy lawyer!  There is nothing a projects lawyer likes to discuss more than force majeure! All joking aside - the 3 month estimate is the result of our most recent experience with HVB. Having said that, BlockTower did want to speed things up (which @teej and I fully support), so we are aiming for less than 3 months. @teej and I will prepare a proposed execution GANTT chart for the community this week as part of our proposed weekly updates. At the end of the day, as we work for the benefit of the Maker token holders, I think that a simple request to \u201cstop work\u201d will be respected - particularly if there are outside events occurring that give cause for concern on extended timing.     flipflopflapdelegate:  I can easily see the clustering into an Arranger by BlockTower an event that might go beyond 90-days.   An interesting observation - are you referring to \u201cclustering\u201d with a MetaDAO? The proposed 3 month time schedule will be independent of any \u201cclustering\u201d \u2026 there is not enough certainty (today) on how exactly to \u201ccluster\u201d a transaction with the still evolving MetaDAO concept. Having said that, we are evaluating how we might provide some contractual guidance/flexibility on a \u201cclustering\u201d with a MetaDAO. Frankly, for any assets on-boarded before the formal launch of the MetaDAO, this will be an issue to consider. There may be a handful of commercial and financial issues to consider when the MetaDAO assumes an existing asset from Maker. But I will not speculate here and I certainly can\u2019t identify them at present. ",
