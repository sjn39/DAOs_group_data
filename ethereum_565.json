Being able to create an Ethereum client is more than the Yellow Paper. Highlighting the location of all of the relevant pieces that make up running the Ethereum network is important for implementors and to help in understanding how and where changes and upgrades are made. I am proposing that relevant standards used by the Ethereum network be linked from the README of the EIPs repo, thus helping in discovery of these other locations and their maintainers. In addition, I would also propose that these other standards and specifications have a minimum of 2 maintainers identified and listed. I haven\u2019t yet added those maintainers in this PR, but if people can help identifying them and they volunteer to be \u201cofficial\u201d maintainers, we can add them. Here\u2019s the contents of the PR:  Standards and Specifications Aside from improving and upgrading the Ethereum platform, the goal of the EIP process is to document the standards and specifications that define it. Following these specifications, an implementation team should be able to build interoperable components that connect to the Ethereum main net, various test nets, and other layers of the Ethereum network. The list of Ethereum components is as follows. Each component may have a different process for maintenance and updates, but will create or update EIPs to reflect breaking changes and current canonical versions.

There are a number of groups looking to extend the JSON-RPC API, and next steps would also be about looking at the process for proposing those extensions. The JSON-RPC API can potentially be upgraded without waiting for hard forks, although there could be breaking changes that affect middleware providers (web3js, ethersjs, etc.) that are widely used. cc @Arachnid ",

It assumes there should be an official list of relevant standards used by Ethereum and to be used by ethereum based projects. Yes, Whisper and Swarm are a \u201cofficial\u201d part of Ethereum, but does it make them better choice for the projects? Swarm itself have decided NOT to use \u201can official\u201d whisper and created own PSS. So far about usage of one \u201cofficial part of Ethereum\u201d by another \u201cofficial part\u201d. Swarm itself is not ready and will be replaced by IPFS in praxis. Even when it will be ready, it is uncertain that it will be the best available technology for all the cases. So should Swarm be \u201cofficial\u201d technology? IMHO, not. Trying to make an list of relevant standards in EIPs repo, we will make it \u201cofficial one\u201d despite whether it fits changing requirements and if it becomes successful projects. Why should we prefer Swarm over IPFS in the list? Is it just because we thought some years ago we will use Swarm as part of Ethereum to store the chain data and host the DAPPs? But the things are changing, we have new technologies like Plasma coming. Another aspect: Who will decide on the list? Is it an EIP Editor? If yes - it will greatly reduce an inclusivity of ethereum ecosystem. I see the problem you would like to solve, but any \u201cofficial list\u201d of ethereum standards can not be used without usecase requirements in mind. But if you will take care about requirements, you should have both Swarm and IPFS in the list, but EIPs is a bad place for that. I believe the right way is to have Reference Architectures created for particular set of requirements and utilizing best technology available (even if it is not a pure Ethereum). As an Architect, I would prefer any working non-ethereum technlogy over an \u201cofficial\u201d, but still-in-development one. ",

Whisper and Swarm are not only that debatable cases. I doubt even ABI standard \u201cis required to make an interoperable main net client.\u201d because there is no ABI on the EVM level. Main-net connectivity and consensus relevance should not be ONLY the criteria to decide what is Ethereum and what is not. Any list of relevant Ethereum technologies is welcome, but EIP process in its actual version is wrong place for that. Current EIP process is too focused on Core Client development, led by Core Dev Editors, while huge value of Ethereum depends on ecosystem outside the Core. We should extend and decentralize EIP process first before we try to press the whole ethereum universe into it. More reasoning I have made here (sorry for shameless self-reference). Once more, I would support any approach for \u201cHighlighting the other standards & specs that make up Ethereum\u201d but not as part of current EIP process - it is not suitable for this global task.

Non-Core is something, that CoreDevs will not implement in their Clients. Current EIP Editors are Core Devs and they should not manage everything.

I see Whisper and Swarm as \u201cofficially pre-selected\u201d messaging and storage solutions now, but I doubt this official endorsement is a good thing. Whisper is not used by Swarm and the Swarm is still not production ready. I suppose inclusiveness and friendly competition would bring more benefits and is more healthy than a sticky pre-selection. Personally, I am trying to avoid statements what is Core and what is not. It is just because I am not a CoreDev. Generally I would avoid to define responsibilities for others. Anyone should decide only on stuff he is working on: CoreDevs (not me!) should define Core technologies, Wallet Devs (not me!) should define their Wallet technologies, and so on. If for example Core Devs will see Whisper as official Core Tech, I have nothing against it, but I would expect they should take care about its compatibility to other Core parts first. If they don\u2019t care, they should not make Whisper \u201cofficial\u201d, otherwise we become a nice gap between official statement and the real state. All in all: I see only one rule to determine what is Core Tech and what is not: Have Core Devs provided a standard implementation in their clients and ready to maintain it? If yes - it is Core Tech, if not - it is third party.  Whisper looks like third party soft currently, ABI looks like Core.     boris:  (2) how exactly specs evolve is undetermined.
