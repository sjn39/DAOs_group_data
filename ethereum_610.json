It has been thrown around (pretty frivilously) that PRs should be made against EIP-1, but we can\u2019t merge those as drafts (which is the process for making changes to the protocol). Is the idea that EIP-1 PRs are long lived and sit open indefinitely? Following the EIP process doesn\u2019t feel like it really makes sense, as we can\u2019t say, \u201ceconomic participants can fork\u201d (technically they could fork the EIP repo, but if that is really the intention I feel like it should be spelled out somewhere). This situation reminds me of something I heard a while back:  The first and most important process is a process to change the process.  I feel like we are missing that right now.   ",
