Our tool allows you to spin up on-chain referral marketing campaigns (e.g., earn 0.01 ETH when someone mints an NFT through your link). We believe this is a great way to leverage our own communities to support growth or pay influencers by their impact. Looking forward to supporting DeFi and NFT projects on Optimism. Our website: https://www.chainvine.xyz/ Follow us on Twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/chainvine_xyz  Please DM me in Discord if you are interested in joining our beta club: 0xRock#5540 ",
