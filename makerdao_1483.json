                    "content": "Hi Maker Community, This post is to present our latest PR work and update you on the achieved milestones the months of June and July, 2022. For more information on the work progress prior to June, please check out the May update here and the April/May PR update here.  Highlights of the month     1. Bankless Publishing: Canonical vs. Wrapped DAI   Bankless x Maker: Canonical vs Wrapped DAI1176\u00d71298 110 KB   We have once again partnered with the amazing BanklessDAO to educate the DeFi community on our Multichain Strategy and what it means for their DAI. This was a more in-depth technical piece explaining the difference between Canonical and Wrapped DAI, and was also featured in the Bankless Weekly Newsletter.  2. Huntington Valley Bank DAI Vault   HVB x MakerDAO - TheBlock1120\u00d71146 136 KB   We are delighted to share that the recently announced deal with HVB has caught some attention in the media, and we arranged a commentary for TJ to represent Maker in this article from The Block. The interview was also picked up by other media outlets covering the news:    The Block - MakerDAO approves $100 million stablecoin loan vault for 151-year-old US bank   Fintech Post - MakerDAO passes joint loan with long-established US bank   Coin68 - MakerDAO approves 100 million DAI loan for Huntingdon Valley Bank   ForkLog - MakerDAO lends $100 million to US bank   CoinPost - MakerDAO passes joint loan with long-established US bank   Coin Party - MakerDAO passes joint loan with long-established US bank   Bitcoin Ethereum News - MakerDAO Votes to Allow $100M DAI Loans to U.S. Bank   Koin Bulteni - 100 Million Dollars Loan From MakerDAO to Giant Bank   Bitcoinist - U.S. Bank Will Connect With Ethereum\u2019s MakerDAO To Borrow $100 Million   Tech In Cats - Bank To Connect With Ethereum\u2019s MakerDAO To Borrow $100M   Zum News - MakerDAO Opens $100M Cryptocurrency Loan Vault   Head Topics - MakerDAO approves $100 million stablecoin loan vault for 151-year-old US bank   ADVFN - MakerDAO approves $100 million stablecoin loan vault for 151-year-old US bank   Crypto Briefing - MakerDAO Votes to Allow $100M DAI Loans to U.S. Bank   Journal Time - A US Bank With More Than 150 Years Will Borrow From MakerDAO In Stablecoin DAI      State of the Maker Brand  To better understand the current awareness and branding position that Maker is at right now, our PR team has helped us with monitoring daily media covering all across the world. This extensive list of media articles includes mentions of MakerDAO or the Maker Protocol in articles that are not focused on Maker - meaning that we have been observing the use of the Maker brand as either an example in DeFi or as a partner involved in other projects within the ecosystem. That being said, this continuously growing list has helped us understand the current brand recognition and awareness. Some key facts about this analysis:  The data was collected between June 13th - July 26th, 2022  The database has a total of 610 mentions within this time period (which I personally find very impressive) The data includes mentions of Maker in several languages besides English from several countries The analized data was categorized by: (1) Country code; (2) Media Outlet; (3) Number of mentions The database presents the natural network effect of the Maker brand in the ecosystem combining mentions in the news, educational content, market analysis, etc.  Below you can see some key statistics derived from the analysis. 1. By Country: Number of Maker mentions in the media showcased by the geographical location of the outlet, their target group and/or language. Note: 1 mention = 1 article  Number of Maker mentions between June 13 - July 26, 2022 - Sorted by Country1920\u00d71137 104 KB   2. By Media Outlet: Number of Maker mentions in each media outlet. Note: 1 mention = 1 article Because the database was quite large, this specific chart includes only media outlets that have mentioned Maker at least 5 times within the selected time period. Media outlets that mentioned Maker between 1-5 times are therefore omitted.  Sheet 1 (1)3320\u00d72174 303 KB  Note: Some outlets in our database appear to distribute their news in several languages and/or geographies. Hence they might appear in the chart more times under different country codes.  3. By date: Number of Maker mentions on each publishing date within the selected time frame.  Sheet 33280\u00d72040 215 KB    Synopsis/Summary of the analysis  The purpose of this ongoing analysis has been to observe the overall awareness of Maker as a protocol within the media and understand the current trends in which Maker is being associated with, as well as the countries and media outlets that Maker is most talked about. An interesting observation is certainly the spike in number of mentions on specific dates - which we associated with market news: Terra crash, Celsius loans repayment, etc. Overall - we can say that Maker is most often mentioned in relation to these topics: 1. Market movements/news (eg. Terra, Celsius, etc) 2. MakerDAO News (eg. HVB; SG-Forge; Governance proposals, etc) 3. Market trends (eg. \u201cTop Coins to buy\u201d type of opinion pieces; Stablecoin analysis, etc) 4. Explainers/Educational content (What is DAI, How DeFi works, etc.) Below I have also attached a collage with some of the headlines from our database without a specific order/preference to show you how diverse the sentiment and coverage is.  MakerDAO headlines in the media1280\u00d7718 197 KB  I want to highlight that this analysis in ongoing and the intention behind it is to also use the collected data to find way for future business opportunities which will help the Growth team. A few interesting observations (to me) are:   We have a lot more coverage in Asia than we expected - Eg. 192 mentions in China   Some well-known outlets prove to be true Maker fans as they mention us extremely often Examples: The Defiant = 14 mentions; BeInCrypto = 14 mentions; Bitcoin Ethereum News = 13 mentions; Blockworks = 10 mentions; etc. I personally find this this to be a very good sign that Maker as a protocol is well-known and respected. Also note the mentions are only within 1.5 months   Although this attempt to a sentiment analysis is manual and based on a database having overall little sentiment (eg. very few Opinion Articles included and mostly News Coverage) - I would say that the overall sentiment towards Maker is quite predominantly positive and neutral.   The media is watching us (the forum) and has been proven to build their stories based on not only what they read, but also how they interpret the information. That way, many things get lost in translation and there is plenty of space for misinterpretation. It is crucial for us to start taking more ownership over the Maker messaging and start collaborating with the media more - so that we can rewrite our narrative.     Twitter Metrics - Q2 2022 This is a short recap of the milestones achieved and some key metrics regarding our official MakerDAO Twitter account extracted by the coolest @tobalgarcia  Dashboard: Our Twitter Account in numbers  Screenshot 2022-07-27 at 18.12.571920\u00d7451 68.7 KB  Top Tweets by impressions:   MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution - 116.2k impressions   rETH Vote as a new collateral type in the Maker Protocol - 104.5k impressions   System Surplus reaches 70M DAI for the first time - 90.2k impressions   Top Tweets by engagement rates:   The first real estate deal with 6SCapital and Tesla - 3,728 engagements   What\u2019s going on behind the Maker protocol in current market? - 3,542 engagements   MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution - 2,768 engagements    Some learnings and observations by @tobalgarcia on our Twitter performance and audience behavior:  We found a balance of number of tweets and number of threads around 200+ and 15+ respectively which led to a very good boost on overall metrics. Our audience is particularly interested in our most important governance decisions, mainly those coming from balance sheet management, real-world finance and new collaterals. Plus, our audience has been closely following how our Governance is making decisions on bot crypto-native and  real-world asset collaterals. New followers started to slow down. Maybe it\u2019s because Twitter is punishing harder bots? We\u2019ll try to investigate.    Current status of the MakerDAO Announcement Table: Since we are currently working to coordinate all of the major MakerDAO announcements for our Twitter and media audience, we created a workflow that treats each announcement as a project, and whose documentation process is publicly updated through this Notion database called MakerDAO Announcement Table.  Screenshot 2022-07-27 at 18.39.461974\u00d71136 416 KB   On the branding/marketing side of things, we have also continued our partnership with Bankless (podcast) and you can see our ad promotion for Maker Vaults at the beginning of their podcast episodes   See screenshot below.  Screenshot 2022-07-27 at 18.43.311920\u00d71239 93 KB    Moving Forward: What\u2019s next?  Now that we have established a way to measure impact of the current PR and branding efforts, the plan is to use these observations to help in long-term business strategies as the Growth CU. The database is still being updated daily and we will come back with a more in-depth analysis at a later stage. We are, overall, very happy with the media placements over Q2 in 2022. It does seem that Maker as a brand is finally making more noise in the media thanks to our PR efforts. Other things we are working on include:  Media relations strategy Media trainings (already had a couple of Maker spokespeople undergo the training and more to be scheduled) Crisis Management strategy Messaging/Narrative Daily Media Monitoring  Some personal thoughts based on my observations: Maker has a winning business model in many aspects of it\u2019s essence - hence the brand recognition has a lot to do with the mechanics of our governance, DAI, RWA strategy, Multichain strategy, and so on - and very little to do with our actual branding or identity as a brand. Since the website and LinkedIn page have been dormant for over a year, the only source of \u2018news\u2019 for people to learn about what Maker is up to are:  Twitter (more \u2018degen\u2019 type of audience) Forum (can be very confusing for newcomers) Partner channels (useful to attract new users of DAI but not most impactful without proper branding)  We lack a visual identity and consistency in our branding. We lack a place of aggregated and updated information covering all the latest, easy-to-digest news that also present our identity as a brand which we could send to our partners, community members and crypto-curious friends. With that in mind, we decided to start thinking long-term on all the points above + the brand identity of Maker. As a team, we have now established a schedule of weekly brainstorming sessions to get creative in our future campaigns//ads/tactics; to discuss the long-term strategy of the Maker brand and learn to align our intentions with our actions. The first question we took as a homework today is:  > If Maker was a person - how would you describe it?  Curious to hear your thoughts on this  So feel free to answer in the comments. We will keep working continuously on gaining more media exposure and growing the Twitter account, but will now also focus on developing best practices and tactics to also build up a brand that will last beyond these market conditions and take Maker to the next level - so keep an eye on us! Let\u2019s Make Maker Great Again! __ Bottom line: Personal thanks to my amazing teammates @MarianoDP @Lozadaluis12 @tobalgarcia @Mamun for the good work ethic and infinite flow of ideas. Also kudos to our PR agency, Wachsman, for always supporting us in all PR-related work the best way possible and a little kudos also to @tadeo for helping me remember my long-lost EXCEL skills to analyze all that data  ",
