In the interest of archiving these monthly mentions, I\u2019ll be posting the monthly tweetstorm here in the forum.

Huge thanks to everyone who uses and supports $Dai   14/ SPECIAL SHOUTOUT TO InstaDApp and DeFiSaver for creating migration tools that allow CDP owners to convert to Vaults incrementally. The main frustration for migrators was the dependency on Sai in the migration contract. Those migration tools certainly helped.   15/ One of our community rockstars, LongForWisdom, created a Forum Navigation Index(Forum Navigation Index) to help people that are looking through our forums where most of the heavier conversations around MakerDAO governance happen. That was wise.  16/ @iamTWB_ (Tim Black) has been killing it with the summaries for the weekly Governance & Risk calls. We\u2019ve been working together to standardize them and make them as useful as possible.

Thank you to all of you who are building, using, and appreciating what we have on our hands. I\u2019m excited to see how $Dai can change the world. ",
