Today, we are working together on protocol research and governance efforts. Many of you may know @mhonkasalo on Twitter. I was previously on the research team at The Block and on the investment team for ParaFi Capital. @teemulau has experience organizing one of the largest tech events globally, Slush, and working in finance & ops positions in startups. We are long-term MKR holders and have been part of the community for years.   Our values and initiatives  Helping MakerDAO craft a growth strategy Market downturns are the best time for fundamentally strong protocols like MakerDAO to capture market share and grow against the wind. First, we view the future of DAI as increasingly B2B instead of B2C (which most crypto protocols are today). In the crypto context, this means DAO-to-DAO. MakerDAO can become the wholesale lender for all of DeFi who distributes DAI through their channels \u2013 we are seeing the first steps of this with the Aave, Compound TrueFi, and Maple D3M modules. We recognize the ongoing discussion relating to fundraising and want to take an active role in assisting with the process. If there\u2019s a fundraise, in no scenario should it dilute MKR holders. There should be a clear data-driven cost/benefit analysis on the need for a capital raise. The lack of excitement and engagement from outside of the Maker community is a large problem. Reasons for this need to be discussed, including the idea of bringing more utility to the MKR token. As an example, stkMKR proposed by monetsupply would bring a more enticing token economic model with arguably no downside to the project. Even if this is not the priority today, it\u2019s clear that an update is required and would improve the system. A buy-and-burn mechanism is good \u2014 especially when prices are low leading to more MKR being burned \u2014 but stkMKR would offer better reward targeting, security, and potentially a stronger narrative.  Supporting a scalable DAO model A key reason we are doing this is that Maker governance needs more active delegates with enough weight to have an impact on the overall results and to drive new initiatives that don\u2019t necessarily originate from Maker core team members. Voter apathy is a huge issue. At one of the governance meetings, it was reported that 2 entities had 90% of the active voting power. Hasu has pointed out that MakerDAO suffers from the principal-agent problem. Core Units aren\u2019t always aligned with the interests of MKR holders. Establishing trust between MKR holders and the Core Units is key going forward. The Core Units are often doing a great job but even then, MKR holders aren\u2019t finding out about it. The relationship between MKR holders and Core Units shouldn\u2019t be adversarial \u2013 in fact, it should be the opposite. Maker is currently unprofitable. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that resources should be cut, but now is a good opportunity for further analysis and ensure that goals to help Maker scale are being prioritized correctly. The current market environment highlights the need for financial discipline \u2013 now and in the future. We want to help get Maker ready for growth when the opportunity arises. This means scalable processes and using Maker\u2019s inherent advantages to drive demand \u2014 such as low-interest rates to outcompete others.  Conflicts of Interest  We don\u2019t have any investments or incentives that should impact our role as a delegate at the current time. MKR has been one of our core holdings for a long time. We consider ourselves very strongly aligned with the long-term success of the project. We have also read, and agree with, the Recognised Delegate Code of Conduct.  ",

Add rETH as a new Vault Type - June 13, 2022 - No, right now Rocketpool and rETH wouldn\u2019t contribute significant revenue to the protocol and resources are better spent elsewhere. This could mean that rETH can be voted in at a later time. Exec votes: Temporarily Disable the Aave DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) - June 15, 2022 -  Supported. From a risk management point of view, a lot of DAI is theoretically at risk. We recognize the other side of the discussion, namely what kind of relationship Maker wants to have with Aave, highlighted by @MakerMan and others. Still, considering the market turmoil, it is better to play it safe right now and continue to manage the good relationships with Aave. ",

We believe Maker should simplify its governance processes rather than creating additional layers. Cross-CU work should be encouraged and be possible within the existing CU budget framework. If the real necessity of Task Forces as a new governance structure is demonstrated better, we are open to reforming our opinion. Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) - June 13, 2022 - No, for the reasons above. Growth initiatives are important and should be pursued within the existing budgets. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to IS-001 - @psychonaut (MIP41c4-SP34) - June 13, 2022 - Abstain. We do not have enough knowledge of the person to make a fair informed decision, considering the vote being controversial. Ratification Poll for Facilitator Onboarding to DIN-001 - @tadeo (MIP41c4-SP35) - June 13, 2022 - Yes, based on the overwhelmingly positive response from other delegates and large MKR holders. Ratification Poll for Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) - June 13, 2022 - Yes, we have discussed with various people including @luca_pro himself and are convinced of his professionalism and expect positive future contributions to Maker. The proposed unit is essentially an oversight audit function, which we see beneficial for the DAO. Ratification Poll for Adding a Special Purpose Fund - Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) - June 13, 2022 - Yes, generating yield on DAI should be a long-term priority and we believe this proposal is a solid first step in testing out these strategies. We look forward to evaluating each of the strategies separately. Ratification Poll for MIP16 Amendments (MIP4c2-SP20) - June 13, 2022 - Yes, the motivation for the changes are clearly defined and we do not see any downsides to the decision. Ratification Poll for Permissionless Open Market Operations (MIP74) - June 13, 2022 - Yes, we see this is as a useful technical piece of infrastructure which keeps options open in the future, as argued by @LongForWisdom. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Strategic Finance Core Unit Budget, SF-001 (MIP40c3-SP69) - June 13, 2022 - Approve existing budget only (business as usual). The Strategic Finance CU is important to the operations of Maker, but at this point, only few budget increases should go through if seen absolutely critical. Ratification Poll for Onboard/Amend Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) - June 13, 2022 - Abstain, we are not deep enough in understanding the Keep3r system to make an informed decision. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Growth Core Unit Budget, GRO-001 (MIP40c3-SP70) - June 13, 2022 - Approve increased budget (BearMarket). A slight increase in budget is justified for growth, since there is currently a unique opportunity to gain market share for DAI. Exec votes:  MKR Vesting Transfers - June 22, 2022 -  Supported. There is nothing controversial in the proposal in our view. ",

Prioritization Sentiment - Collateral Class - June 6, 2022   Peg Stability Solutions   Broader Market Demand-Based Solutions   Real-World Asset Vaults   One of Maker\u2019s current key challenges is its reliance on USDC as collateral.

Additionally, we view other D3M\u2019s like Aave\u2019s important for Maker\u2019s growth together with onboarding Real World Assets. Maker should onboard the correct RWAs that 1) have quantifiable risks 2) lucrative enough in terms of yield 3) overall clarity to onboard with reasonable time investment.

Maker effectively has billions of USDC on the balance sheet doing nothing, which has been widely discussed in the community. Diversifying USDC to exposure to short-term bonds has been one of the widely agreed core short-term goals. As long as counterparty risk is well-managed, proposals like this make sense. ",

Ratification Poll for Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments (MIP4c2-SP15) - August 8, 2022 - Yes, a process that is simpler to offboard CUs has been needed and this proposal is a good step towards accomplishing that. The aim is to reduce harm to the DAO and community in the event of CU disruptions. Historically, the offboarding process hasn\u2019t been clear enough and we support the clarifications of the process. Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 - Approve proposed budget (Reduced budget exempt from further cuts for 12 months), it\u2019s great that in the proposed budget the Oracle CU is proactively suggesting cutting their expenses by 10%. Given the importance of oracles for the security and development of Maker, this is a CU that\u2019s important to keep well-resourced. Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) - August 8, 2022 - Yes, we support expanding the D3M module from lending protocols to a more generalized version. Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022 - Yes, adding DAI liquidity on L2s is extremely important for the competitiveness of Maker. This is a good use of Maker protocol-owned DAI, and we\u2019d like to see these efforts expanded. The goal should be to replace USDC as the primary trading pair on L2s. We consider this as an important piece in DAI expansion and growth. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 - No, we want to keep the events CU, but expect financial responsibility. Events are a small and important factor in the big picture, and off-boarding this CU doesn\u2019t really solve anything long-term. When looking at budget cuts, we should be focusing on large capital inefficient structures that can be trimmed down. Exec votes: MOMC Parameter Changes, SocGen Vault Drawdown Authorization, Recognized Delegate Compensation, HVBank Legal Agreement Amendment - August 12, 2022 -  Supported. Excited to see the stETH stability fee vault at 0% to encourage borrowing \u2013 this should be pushed out via marketing channels heavily. We\u2019d support more aggressive lower rates across all vaults as well. It is disappointing to see the HVBank deal frozen. Maker should create organizational structures that minimize the risk of this happening in the future. ",

That is determined by how much DEX volume is currently being generated by this token pair as the yield potential will determine how much liquidity is attracted to the pool. There\u2019s a lot of upward potential to go in the Uniswap v3 pool before the yields start to dwindle down. Historically, there\u2019s been around $3M in volume per day in the Uniswap renBTC-WBTC pool. And there\u2019s been around $5M per day in the Curve pools. That\u2019s a total of $8M in aggregate volume. On 100M TVL, that\u2019s $4,000 in fees generated per day, which is around 1.46% APR without applying any leverage.  Currently the GUNI-V3-DAI-USDC pool is generating around 0.6% APR at the moment and has reached a maximal TVL of around $1B. It\u2019s also important to look at general renBTC volume on Curve and Uniswap, not necessarily the strict renBTC to WBTC trade. Curve.fi/renbtc trading volume. When there\u2019s a lot more renBTC/WBTC liquidity on Uniswap, we can expect a lot of general renBTC trade volume to get routed thru Uniswap if let\u2019s say they\u2019re trading from renBTC to ETH. A lot of that trade volume will hit the renBTC-WBTC pool because the route would go renBTC <> WBTC <> ETH. Price impact is already low on the WBTC to ETH leg of the trade on Uniswap, so when you lower the renBTC to WBTC price impact, you\u2019ll also get a material amount of volume allocated there on DEX aggregators. I\u2019ve also been in talks with some hedge funds and institutions that are looking to make a delta neutral play where they have multiplied exposure to this pair, and shorting the same exposure on a perpetual futures exchange. So, I think the overall demand for this collateral is not necessarily going to be driven by the current renBTC demand on MakerDAO, but moreso, the yield potential from the renBTC <> WBTC trade on Uniswap. Hope that helps!  I know you guys are delegates on Uniswap as well, so happy to talk thru this over the phone in more detail if that makes sense. Thanks again for the feedback! ",

Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 - Yes, a good grassroots movement for a fair price.

Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 - Abstain, we don\u2019t view the SH-001 offboarding as a high-priority or high-impact issue.

For the upcoming votes related to the endgame, we will decide on an individual basis based on the merits of the specific MIP. In our opinion, there are many questions around the viability of e.g. the token economics proposed between MakerDAO and the MetaDAOs. It\u2019s positive that the  LDO <> MKR swap was removed from this MIP set. This MIP set can be beneficial to Maker. However, it also sets up open questions in the future. The main ones to be worried about are (i) poorly designed dilution of MKR holders, and (ii) setting up the removal of the DAI-USD peg. For MKR inflation, the current plan of 50k annual MKR inflation goes into supporting MetaDAOs in exchange for MetaDAO tokens. This equals investing ~$50m annually with these (low) MKR prices. We don\u2019t want MKR holders to be diluted even in the slightest at the benefit of new (MetaDAO) token holders where the ownership structure is questionable. Right now, at least to us, it\u2019s unclear what is the exact process of how the MetaDAO tokens are distributed. ",

This is the one thing Maker should continue investing in \u2013 top-tier engineering talent. With revenue coming from e.g. Coinbase soon, we are more comfortable extending a budget higher than the lowest suggested.  Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022  No. Based on the amounts already allocated to Coinbase and Monetalis, Maker is better off not increasing its counterparty risk more at this time. Additionally, enough capital has been allocated from the PSM from now.  Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Mandate (MIP39c2-SP38) - November 14, 2022  No. We\u2019d like to see more information on why this CU is indispensable to Maker. We believe ISCU is better off as its own revenue-generating entity in the ecosystem.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP83) - November 14, 2022  Reject budget. See comments on the ratification poll on the Immunefi Security Core Unit Mandate.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Governance Communications Core Unit DAI Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP84) - November 14, 2022  Approve Budget.

Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit DAI Budget, SAS-001 (MIP40c3-SP85) - November 14, 2022  Reject Budget. At the current moment, we don\u2019t see the SAS-001 as crucial to the operations of Maker. We would like to see more information on why this CU is needed.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify TechOps Core Unit DAI Budget, TECH-001 (MIP40c3-SP86) - November 14, 2022  Approve budget. TechOps performs functions that we believe are crucial to Maker and the proposed budget is in line with the results they\u2019ve produced in the past.  Ratification Poll for Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit (MIP84c10-SP1) - November 14, 2022  No. We previously voted for the Endgame Plan with the plan to cap the surplus buffer at a lower number to invest in ETH. At current ETH prices, we believe this is a reasonable risk for Maker to take but would like to exercise caution with similar decisions in the future.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022  Yes. Residential mortgage-backed investments are riskier than treasury yield investments, and we believe Maker needs to have better RWA monitoring going forward. However, we support this proposal.  Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022  Yes. We approve investing in Blackrock/iShares ETF products to increase earnings and reduce reliance on Circle/Coinbase. However, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Maker needs better RWA monitoring tools to asses risk and this is something Monetalis needs to provide.  Budget Ratification Poll for Modify the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit DAI Budget, SES-001 (MIP40c3-SP87) - November 14, 2022  Approve speedy operations platform option budget. SES provides an important function to Maker and the proposed budget reduction makes sense in our opinion.  ",

This proposal does not define clearly what it is required for qualification and seems to create overhead/complexity that did not previously exist.

Ratification Poll for Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults (MIP13c3-SP13) - January 9, 2023 - Yes, we have previously warned of the need for better RWA monitoring and consider this an extremely urgent matter to be fixed. Ratification Poll for Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Chainlink Automation (MIP63c4-SP5) - January 9, 2023 - Yes, onboarding Chainlink to the Maker\u2019s Keeper network is a no-brainer and we think they\u2019ve shown good proactivity running this pro-bono for a test period. Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 - Yes, we expect an increase in SPF requests and see no reason to force Maker to keep the limit at 250k DAI.

Ratification Poll for Amend MIP51 to Remove MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) (MIP4c2-SP28) - January 9, 2023 - Yes, there\u2019s no need for a calendar holiday in the governance process \u2013 Maker should have enough redundancy and active participants to be able to make decisions whenever. This is also what separates us from traditional finance. Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023  - Approve both, we believe both changes make sense. Abstaining should be allowed but the 60% threshold recommended here is reasonable. For security purposes, it\u2019s important for executives to be voted on within 72 hours. ",

Adjust the GUSD PSM Debt Ceiling - January 16, 2023 - No change (500 million DAI). Our main concern is the overwhelming majority of GUSD supply inorganically being in the PSM (~85%). This shows there\u2019s no organic demand outside of Maker PSM, unfortunately. For example, by comparison, the percentage of USDC supply in PSM is a few percent. Balancing the good reputation and regulatory standing of Gemini (to date), the revenue being generated for Maker, and the existential risk GUSD presents to Maker is difficult. It\u2019s possible to argue that the Gemini Earn situation should not impact GUSD and no material facts have changed since the GUSD PSM debt ceiling increase was approved. Even if Maker decides to instead lower the debt ceiling (to 100m or 0), the challenge here is that it does nothing except stop the generation of more DAI with GUSD \u2013 but does not create a market force to unwind the position. Therefore we\u2019re voting to keep the debt ceiling at the current levels. Lowering the GUSD PSM tout to 0% shouldn\u2019t have any significant effect in the short term either. At the same time, this might slightly reduce the supply long-term, so we\u2019re voting to lower the tout to 0%. If Maker wants to unwind the GUSD risk, the question remains how to properly do that? The only possible solution seems to be implementing a market incentive (e.g. negative tout?) to encourage an unwinding process. This would create a higher impact poll. ",

Long-term Maker should either burn a lot of MKR, issue significant \u201cDAI dividends\u201d to MKR holders (staked Maker), or use profits to include risky assets (like staked ETH) to its treasury. The most important thing is that Maker has a healthy PnL, growing DAI supply, and growing profit margins (with sufficient decentralization and keeping the DAI dollar peg). Maker needs to focus on how to grow the next 10x from here and not focus on incremental signaling tricks. The market price of MKR ultimately depends on Maker\u2019s ability to generate cash flow, and the market\u2019s expectation of future cash flows. This cash flow can then be distributed to holders in various above mentioned ways (like burning a lot of MKR). ",

Comment bundled for the two above: We support this initial resource allocation from PECU to Phoenix Labs. However, it is somewhat likely that these resource needs grow, as Spark Protocol (hopefully) grows. If so, there should be further discussions and votes about the situation. Hexonaut has written the following: \u201cSpark Protocol is being developed by Phoenix Labs but is wholly owned by Maker Governance. This includes all smart contracts, trademarks, IP, etc. Phoenix Labs expects to merge Spark Protocol into a Maker SubDAO when they become available. As part of the Endgame plan, multiple competitive SubDAOs are being formed next year with associated tokens that are linked to cash-flows from the SubDAO products. Revenue generated from Spark Protocol will go to these token holders.\u201d There needs to be a clear understanding of how much work, if any, is done at MKR holders\u2019 expense on the basis of mutual benefit between Maker and any future SubDAOs. Here, it seems that the future Spark SubDAO token launch will be completely fair and Maker Governance owns the project. So we\u2019re voting yes on this. These ownership details are something we are watching closely for any upcoming SubDAO and will adjust our future votes accordingly. ",

Despite voting against the proposal, we will continue to work as delegates in Maker and view it not as a catastrophic change \u2013 if this is the direction MKR holders want we will accept it and try to push things in the right direction within Endgame. Our key worries with the proposed Endgame constitution and the future of where it might lead are:  Possibility to remove DAI from being pegged to USD. We view this as the most important product feature of DAI and do not see demand for a product that isn\u2019t strongly tied to USD. This is only possible with USD-like collateral and accepting regulatory risk. Unclarity around MKR inflation and dilution to existing holders. It\u2019s unclear how much this will exactly be and more crucially, how it will be distributed. In any case, existing MKR holders will be diluted and we think the proposed figures of 40-60k MKR per year are enormous. Additionally, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s Maker\u2019s job to do public goods or charity funding i.e. the 20k MKR allocated to such activities. Ethereum is a public good but the protocol doesn\u2019t have a charity element. Governance overhead. We don\u2019t think the proposed governance mechanisms around e.g. committees will decrease bad incentives or overhead in the governance process. To us, these feel like overcomplicated mechanisms that bring bureaucracy. The goal should be to increase the amount of MKR delegated but we feel it\u2019s the incentive of current delegates to not support this type of idea because it dilutes the voting power of every single current delegate. This Endgame vote will probably decrease the number of MKR that are actively voting within the ecosystem.     Despite the results of this vote, we are optimistic about the future of Maker and looking forward to working with the community on how we can improve on what we consider the worst parts of Endgame. We will continue the vote as objectively as possible for the long-term benefit of the average MKR holder. This is independent of the importance of the vote.  ",
