                    "content": "What\u2019s the problem? We have had a few developments in parallel regarding the USDC PSM.   The amount of USDC in it has gone up from 800M to 1.4B over the last week - see here for current amount. With the additional 240M USDC in vaults, 37.2% of DAI is backed by USDC.   The PSM debt ceiling will soon be raised to 3B.   The tout fee looks like it will be reduced to 0.   Some shady stuff is going on with how USDC is backed. I have to admit, this point is extremely worrying, at least for me. I\u2019m sure similar stuff happens with all the other centralized stablecoins too.   What can we do about it? We do not have a good short to medium term solution to boost DAI supply and get it below $1. Given the current situation, I propose that we raise the tin fee and decrease the amount of USDC flowing in. What are the consequences? The upsides are  We will decrease the rate at which USDC gets added to the PSM. This combined with other measures will be what we need to eventually make DAI independent of other stablecoins again. We will earn more fees from the PSM.  The downside is  DAI may now trade for higher than $1.01 before the PSM kicks in.  Why is it worth doing anyway? Personally, I do not think the downside is as bad as it first sounds and here\u2019s why:  During calm market periods, DAI is mostly below $1.01 anyway. The change to the tin will have no effect during such periods. This is today\u2019s (26/05) chart from dai.stablecoin.science   Screenshot 2021-05-27 at 1.56.12 AM1792\u00d71244 232 KB    During volatile market periods, DAI goes off peg anyway (as does USDC) and it takes a while before arbitragers use the PSM to get it back in line. Our response time to bringing it back to peg will get longer but I find this acceptable.   DAI was always meant to be soft pegged to USD. There is nothing special about $1.01 and if we\u2019re happy/unhappy to see DAI trading at this price in the worst case, then we would also be similarly happy/unhappy to see DAI trading at some other 1 + delta as long as delta is widely seen as \u201creasonably small\u201d.   TL;DR I think the \u201coff-peggedness\u201d of DAI will not be as bad as some might fear. In summary The higher tin balances our two conflicting goals of keeping DAI pegged and staying a decentralized and fully backed stablecoin. I think this is a reasonable compromise, particularly with questions being raised around the backing behind USDC. Please vote and make your voice heard!     Increase tin Keep tin the same Abstain     0 voters     Next steps If there is some consensus here, I will start a signal request with a poll for new tin options. ",

Keeping a tight peg also makes it liquid \u2013 and I think people assume marketable (can sell at any time) = liquid (can sell at any time for the actual value). DAI cannot just be marketable. It has to be liquid as much as possible. Given where most of our DAI come from \u2013 large users \u2013 I\u2019m not in favor of telling our biggest users they have to suffer a million dollar in slippage just because we can\u2019t get it together about diversifying our balance sheet. Want to reduce pressure on the PSM? Then we need to make more inflationary parts of the protocol \u2013 overcollateralized loans when operating as designed are unlikely to do that. RWA may do that, but it\u2019ll be a long time before that\u2019s material to the DAI supply. I don\u2019t have a great answer for this that\u2019s better than \u201cget more collateral that pays us fees\u201d but busting the peg even a little is the fastest route to DAI looking like FEI or LUSD or any number of other semi-failed stablecoins. We\u2019re a serious organization that wants to do serious business with Very Serious People, and we have to take our responsibilities seriously \u2013 unlike almost all other stablecoins. That\u2019s part of why Maker is a success and others have been languishing. ",
