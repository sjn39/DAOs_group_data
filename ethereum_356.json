                    "content": "Abstract This EIP introduces a new type of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) called Dynamic Fractional Non-Fungible Token (DF-NFT), which represents on-demand resource usage rights. DF-NFTs are generated by fractionalizing an ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token that represents a shareable usage right for a set of resources bound to physical assets or resources, such as computing resources bound to a PC, smartphone, or IOT device. The goal is to facilitate the recycling of a shareable usage right for resources in a decentralized, secure, and traceable manner. The proposal outlines a set of functions that define two array variables: resource classification and quantities, which dynamically record the classification and corresponding available quantities of various resources that share usage rights. An implementation allows changing the current resource quantities for a given ERC-721 NFT (Parent NFT), along with the generation or burning of a DF-NFT. This proposal extends the existing EIP-721 standard. Motivation The sharing economy has experienced significant growth in recent years, resulting in the emergence of new business models such as car-sharing (e.g., Uber) and home-sharing (e.g., AirBnb), among others. However, the current lack of a decentralized way to represent and trade shared usage rights for physical assets or resources creates a fragmented and inefficient market with high barriers to entry and limited access to a global audience. DF-NFTs offer a solution that enables individuals to own fractional resource usage rights dynamically, facilitating efficiency, secure, and transparency. This allows for wider participation in the sharing economy on a larger scale. Specification interface IDFNFT{ /**   @dev Mint a ParentNFT that represents a shareable usage right for a set of resources   @param resourceNames Classification of various resources   @param resourceQuantities Available quantities of various resources   */ function mintParentNFT(address to, string[] memory resourceNames, uint256[] memory resourceQuantities) external; /**   @dev Get the token ID of a DF-NFT\u2019s ParentNFT   Check if tokenId is the token ID of a DF-NFT   @param tokenId The token ID of a DF-NFT   */ function getParentTokenId(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256); /**   @dev Generating a DF-NFT   Check if parentTokenId is the token ID of a ParentNFT   Check if the user is eligible for generating a DF-NFT   Check if resourceQuantities of ParentNFT meets the user\u2019s demand   Reduce the resourceQuantities of ParentNFT accordingly after generating a DF-NFT that represents fractional resource usage right   @param parentTokenId The token ID of a ParentNFT   @param user Address of the user who requests resource usage right on demand   @param resourceNames Classification of resources requested by the user   @param resourceQuantities Quantities of resources requested by the user   */ function newDFNFT(uint256 parentTokenId, address user, string memory resourceNames, uint256 memory resourceQuantities) external\uff1b /**   @dev Burning a DF-NFT   Check if the user is eligible for burning a DF-NFT   Check if tokenId is the token ID of a DF-NFT   Increase the resourceQuantities of ParentNFT accordingly after burning a DF-NFT that represents fractional resource usage right   @param tokenId The token ID of a DF-NFT   */ function burnDFNFT(uint256 tokenId) external; } We\u2019re looking for feedback before designing a more detailed EIP draft.
