I was thinking if it would be possible to create a new project here. A marketplace that sells/resells products with fiat and with a crypto gateway payment system. Several niche categories that involve the crypto space in the traditional commerce as the NFT, not a dedicated marketplace for Nft\u2019s as there are a bunch out there. We could propose a chart with the benefits to be spent to fund other projects on the quadratic lands, a 15 % of the monthly profits goes to the next voted project by the community, other on marketing and so on. The idea of a marketplace is good as we could do many things within it, the benefits could go on print on demand shirts for the community to promote more the quadratic lands or any kind of marketing implementation on this project. It\u2019s just a small idea and I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m writing it in the proper place or section. But there\u2019s a long time I would like to create one and with it, if we could help other better. ",
