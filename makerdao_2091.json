                    "content": "Budget Our CU officially had a voted budget until July 2022. However given the anticipated delays on the development of teleport, we have decided to reduce costs to be able the promised deliverables within the same budget (see details on our MIP14). We have enough funds to operate until end of March, and we are requesting an additional 65k DAI to operate until June. We will present in June a joint plan with PECU for endgame, along with a new budget proposal with deliverables for the next phase. Risk Management   Bridge limit has been increased to 1Mn DAI. Starknet has delayed its plans to remove the limits on the Starkgate bridges after Regenesis. We will gradually increase the limits at they are reached after Regenesis. Debt ceiling for teleport is remaining at 1Mn DAI Update to the Immunefi bounty to include teleport. Reviewed 4 bug bounties that were out of scope Aligned with PECU on using Starknet as an example to create a templatized process to integrate new rollups. The objective is to make it easier for rollups to deploy canonical DAI, and for PECU to reduce the amount of work required to add a new rollup. The process will be centered around a detailed list of technical due diligence questions Aligned on the Regenesis migration plan with the Starkware team. Details will be discussed end of January in Tel Aviv. Note that the Regenesis has been delayed to later in 2023 Formal verification is still an uncracked problem on Starknet yet a very important one. We are supporting two groups (Veridise, Fuzzing Labs) we be meeting for a working session with in Tel Aviv early February for Starknet sessions  Fast withdrawals  Fast withdrawals is now deployed and operational end-to-end  L1 and L2 contracts have been deployed on mainnet. Debt ceiling for teleport is 1Mn DAI Oracles have been deployed. Quorum of oracles have been reached   Fast withdrawals are now available to use. We have not been communicating yet as we are still implementing the front-end which will be available within 1-2 weeks  Maintenance work ahead of Regenesis Cairo is a maturing language and new versions will be pushed frequently until Cairo 1.0, at which point the Regenesis event will happen. The deployed contracts are backward compatible and do not need to be updated on-chain. However, post-Regenesis backward compatibility will disappear. We are updating our contracts periodically when needed, and that work will take more and more capacity until Regenesis. Teleport development PECU has been designing and developing the EVM L1 and L2 contracts for teleport, which includes Xdomain-dss, Dssbridge, Dssteleport, Join, Router, OracleAuth, and Fees contracts. We are meeting with PECU on a weekly basis with PECU to discuss specific topics. We will be able to start testing the integration to the L1 contracts within the next month. Our status on the contracts to be developed is the following. Done, waiting for integration tests to be refined:  Dai contract: contract developed, tests developed DaiJoin: contract developed, tests developed Vat: contract developed, tests developed TeleportConstantFee: contract developed, tests developed TeleportJoin: contract developed, tests developed TeleportOracleAuth: contract developed, tests developed TeleportRouter: contract developed, tests developed Cure: developed, iteration on tests End: developed, iteration on tests  Remaining to be done:  DomainGuest: draft DomainHost: draft Xdomain-dss: not started  ",

This is nothing to do with the total capacity of the bridge, but rather the capacity of the bridge to offer fast withdrawal You will find a PoC of the analytics for the bridges here ",
