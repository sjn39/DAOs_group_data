You ask question, people send you links  So, my understanding:  name: red pill (Rune), blue pill (Nikolai), purple pill (wishful thinking for compromise). Purple pill was never taken. core disagreement: Rune wanted more mainstream approach (business, legalistic etc) , group of  developers wanted more decentralized approach disagreements were from the beginning: DappHub vs MakerDAO as two separate organizations, with 2 CEOs (Nikolai/Rune) there was a fight around multisig developer fund control in 2018. Rune won and MakerDAO is in control of the funds and a lot of blue pillers left the project there might be legal things still going on, since Foundation people seem not to comment much  Notes:  red pill / blue pill: there is a scene in a movie Matrix (1999) DappHub are developers focused on (core) contract coding, MakerDAO is dealing with bussines side. Andy Milenius was a CTO and wrote a 24page document called \u201cZandy\u2019s story\u201d where you can a lot of information from \u201cblue piller\u201d perspective.

So, outside of the entertainment value of building upon on old conspiracy theories and speculating about past events (in front of the very people who are legally unable to respond), there is literally nothing positive that can be achieved from rehashing the same suppositions, one sided opinions, or old resentments. If this thread devolves into theories about the motives and activities of people who are unable to speak publicly for themselves, or results in further demands for explanations that we cannot provide, the thread will be locked. I would consider it a deep personal favor if the thread watchers could focus on the work we have ahead of us instead of speculating about what might have happened in the past. ",

I definitely don\u2019t want this thread to deteriorate into debating which side was right or wrong - i only asked what was the disagreement about. I will refrain from commenting further. ",

Your bullet points here are a good start jerne, but I\u2019m not sure they explain the event for someone with no information. Would it be worth creating a more detailed (neutral) summary for anyone with this question in the future? This could include links to the various posts and responses posted by both the Foundation and others at the time. As Rich said, this is largely in the past as far as the Foundation is concerned. But it is information that I would want access to if I was a new investor considering investing in MKR. Having a more detailed summary in this forum would show that the community and by extension the Foundation are owning the event and the consequences. I\u2019d want to see:  A more detailed summary in a first post including links for further research. A brief message from Rich similar to the one above. The thread tagged as  ancient history or somesuch. The thread locked to signal that the Foundation considers the matter closed.  Would this be worthwhile, with the aim of preventing threads like this pop up every few months? ",
