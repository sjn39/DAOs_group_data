                    "content": " Quick Lending Market Update + Analysis of Rate Changes of Major Vaults  This analysis covers Maker, Liquity, AAVE v2, and COMP v2 on ETH L1. Only Maker borrows against volatile crypto assets (even excluding stable LPs) are included. AAVE USDC rates include stkAAVE rewards and supply rate of collateral with an assumption of 200% collateral ratio (consistent with risk CU assumption). stETH only considers lido staked ETH and it\u2019s wrapped version. Commentary on data as of January 10, 2023 (embedded views will auto refresh with updated data).  It has been some time since Strategic Finance has dug into loans against crypto assets, because the attention has rightfully been on finding alternative ways to generate revenue given the depressed lending market and minimal demand for credit. Though crypto lending is deep in a bear market, we felt it prudent to keep the community informed on underlying trends and changes in the markets. TL;DR provided at the end for those who are short on time. As shown below, outstanding debt against volatile crypto assets at Maker has been fairly stagnant since its July lows but has been increasing since a local low in early November:  The same is fairly true across the board:  Maker market share of overall stablecoin borrows against volatile crypto assets has been on a steady uptrend since July though. Part of its recent drop off since September might be due to the launch of Compound V3, which launched in late August and (as of 1/10/23) has $87M total borrowed. Longer term, market share seems to be in a range - flat but with fluctuation.  Despite a relatively flat outstanding debt amount since July, revenue on this debt has dwindled significantly, largely due to rate decreases:    The rest of this post is a deep dive that focuses on ETH, WBTC, and stETH vaults, as these represent the largest, most important forms of crypto collateral. It digs deeper into the market shares of stablecoin borrows against these collateral types and evaluates how rate changes have affected those market shares.  The following is a view of market share of stablecoin borrows against ETH (blue line, left axis) with the Maker borrow rate premium (gray, right axis) overlaid. The Maker borrow rate premium here is defined as the ETH blended average borrow rate subtracted by the AAVE USDC borrow rate (with AAVE ETH supply rate accounted for). Directional rate changes of any ETH vault are overlaid too (ignore the number displayed - if the bar is pointed up, a positive rate change happened and vice versa). Directly following this chart is a chart of the specific ETH vault rates with the AAVE USDC rate overlaid, to give clearer context.   What we\u2019re seeing in the data:   AAVE effective borrow rate was negative or very low - lower than all Maker ETH vaults - between 5/16/2021 and 7/16/2021. In this time frame, Maker lost significant market share and kept losing share until shortly after AAVE borrow rates skyrocketed for a few months between late August and Early November 2021.   For most of the time since early November 2021, 6 rate changes kept the blended rate on Maker vaults on average more expensive than AAVE by 1-2%. Despite this, market share has trended very slightly upward.   For most of the time between early August 2022 and now, effective AAVE rates of borrowing USDC against ETH have been negative due to a high supply rate on ETH. Maker has oddly gained market share in this time frame. One can only speculate why - the market may believe these ETH supply rates are ephemeral; the market may be ignorant of this situation or too unengaged to notice; or the market may prefer the risk profile of Maker vaults even if they are more expensive.  Also noteworthy, the proportion of borrow in Maker\u2019s cheapest vault (ETH-C) has decreased in this timeframe, as shown in the chart that follows these bullet points.    The market seems to react fairly quickly to Maker ETH vault stability fee changes.   Key Takeaway: The current situation in the ETH borrow market is that AAVE is a very attractive option for borrowing against ETH right now; this may manifest in reduced market share in the short term but so far hasn\u2019t.     The following is a view of market share of stablecoin borrows against WBTC (blue line, left axis) with the Maker borrow rate premium (gray, right axis) overlaid. The Maker borrow rate premium here is defined as the WBTC blended average borrow rate subtracted by the AAVE USDC borrow rate (with AAVE WBTC supply rate accounted for). Directional rate changes of any WBTC vault are overlaid too (ignore the number displayed - if the bar is pointed up, a positive rate change happened and vice versa). Directly following this chart is a chart of the specific WBTC vault rates with the AAVE USDC rate overlaid, to give clearer context.   What we\u2019re seeing in the data:   AAVE effective borrow rate was negative or very low - lower than all Maker WBTC vaults - between 5/15/2021 and 8/20/2021. In this time frame, Maker lost significant market share.   AAVE borrow rates skyrocketed for a few months between late August and Early November 2021. During this period, Maker market share grew and stayed high until early January 2022, despite AAVE offering better rates for most of November 2021 - January 2022.   Between early January 2022 and early May 2022, Maker market share decreased as most Maker vaults (besides WBTC-C) had more expensive borrow rates than AAVE.   Despite WBTC-A, WBTC-B, and WBTC blended average rates being higher than AAVE USDC rates during May 2022 through early September 2022, Maker market share largely went sideways in this timeframe.   Maker market share has declined since early September 2022, even though AAVE borrow rate surpassed Maker\u2019s blended rate on 10/13/2022 and since 10/19/2022 has hovered around the WBTC-A rate.   For the most part, the market seems to react pretty quickly to changes in rate favorability between Maker and AAVE; however, it does not seem to react very much to Maker rate changes unless they alter favorability.   Key Takeaway: Despite Maker being a fairly attractive option (when comparing rates primarily) of borrowing against WBTC recently, Maker market share here has fallen to a low. Perhaps market share will naturally rise when the market takes notice.    The following is a view of market share of stablecoin borrows against STETH (blue line, left axis) with the Maker borrow rate premium (gray, right axis) overlaid. The Maker borrow rate premium here is defined as the STETH blended average borrow rate subtracted by the AAVE USDC borrow rate. Directional rate changes of any WSTETH vault are overlaid too (ignore the number displayed - if the bar is pointed up, a positive rate change happened and vice versa). Directly following this chart is a chart of the specific STETH vault rates with the AAVE USDC rate overlaid, to give clearer context.   What we\u2019re seeing in the data:   The rate drop on 4/11/2022 made rates on Maker favorable vs AAVE for about 20 days; this was evidently not enough time for market share to meaningfully change.   The launch of WSTETH-B seemed to usher in a wave of increasing market share   WSTETH-B has been cheaper than borrowing at AAVE since inception as AAVE borrow rate has only gotten as low as 92 bps   The hike on 7/16 seemed to only push customers from the -A vault to the -B vault with no drop in overall market share   Despite rates of both vault types being cheaper than AAVE since 9/28/2022, market share has stalled since.   Key Takeaway: Having the cheapest option to borrow against stETH allowed for massive market share growth, but the \u201ccheapest\u201d option can be as high as 92 bps.   Also noteworthy, josolnik of risk CU estimates that revenue cannibalization by the 0 fee stETH-B vault of stETH-A revenue amounts to up to $1.7M DAI:    Impact Analysis: Lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0%   estimated annualized revenue cannibalization to around $1.7 million DAI   In the same analysis, josolnik discovers that only 7% of the stETH-B 0 stability fee debt is from new users:    Impact Analysis: Lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0%   Meanwhile, around $8.6 million of total debt (7%) can be attributed to DSProxy exposure that didn\u2019t interact with other vaults before stETH-B. These could be interpreted as users that are new and potentially started using Maker because of zero cost of borrowing on stETH.     TL;DR   Market share of stablecoin borrow has been fairly stagnant, with fluctuation, between when AAVE v2 launched and now.   Market share in the market of borrowing stablecoins against ETH has been looking fairly strong for Maker; this may be short lived as, at the moment, the borrow rate for this is negative on AAVE v2.   Maker market share of borrowing against WBTC has fallen to lows despite Maker being a fairly attractive option (when comparing rates primarily) of borrowing against WBTC recently.   Having the cheapest option to borrow against stETH allowed for massive market share growth, but the \u201ccheapest\u201d option can be as high as 92 bps.   Appendix Most of these views and more can be found in the new Maker Market Share Dashboard, which has already been posted to the StratFi Dune Directory but not until now announced to the forum. ",
