                    "content": " MIP32: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure  Preamble MIP#: 32 Title: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure Author(s): Alexis Contributors: None Type: Technical Status: Request for Comments (RFC) Date Proposed: 2020-12-18 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: PSM, Uniswap, Vat, Join Usdc-lendler, Join Dai-lendler  Replaces: n/a License: AGPL3+   References  The proposed implementation : dss-psm-cme    Sentence Summary This proposal define a new Peg Stability Module which converts USDC to DAI and DAI to USDC, during the conversion it lends the gem via lender token and leverage the position using cdai.  Paragraph Summary The PSM Compound Mixed Exposure is based on the classic PSM but with a second join plug in serie to leverage the position with Dai. It also uses a \u201clending gem join\u201d which lend dai to cdai and usdc to cusdc. The join is a generic \u2018maker join\u2019 and can be plugged to any vaults. It takes as input a collateral and lends it behind the scene to compound, on the output the join redeems the position and return the collateral. It can be applied to Dai or any compound collaterals. Optional fees tin and tout can be activated as well which send a fraction of the trade into the vow. This PSM will have 2 urns one cDai and one cUsdc, but the maker position for this PSM is still on uscd and dai.  Global Overview Diagram  image643\u00d7563 27.8 KB   Component Summary MIP32c1: The PSM Contains snippet of proposed implementation. MIP32c2: The Lending Join MIP32c3: The Burn Delegator MIP32c4: The Harvest contract MIP32c5: Proposed Code MIP32c6: Test cases Lists existing test cases MIP32c7: Security considerations Comments on the security implications MIP32c8: Licensing States the license under which the proposal and code are distributed.  Motivation Currently, the usdc token inside the PSM is inefficient and needs to be diversified. By using cDai and cUsdc we will bring some diversification. The leverage is also motivated by a better outcome and a better diversification.  Specification The PSM Mixed Exposure is articulated around 3 main components:   The PSM (entry point)   The Join (urn)   The excess delegator (excess token conversion)   The harvest contract    MIP32c1: The PSM It is very similar at the actual PSM (MIP 29) with two vaults, one in Dai and one in Usdc. It has three methods:  sell(address usr, uint256 gemAmt) buy(address usr, uint256 gemAmt) reserve()  It also has three admin methods   file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address  There are three prameters:   tin : The fraction of the Gem \u2192 Dai transaction sent to the vow as a fee. Encoded as tin in wad units.  tout: The fraction of the Dai \u2192 Gem transaction sent to the vow as a fee. Encoded as tout in wad units.  line: The maximum amount of Usdc owns by the PSM. Encoded as line in wad units.  sell will take in input usdc, convert usdc into dai via the new lending join (usdc/dai). Then it will take the dai and convert it to dai via another lending join (Dai/Dai) and take the fees and return the Dai. buy will take in input dai, convert the dai after fee into dai via the lending join (dai/dai). Then it will take the dai and convert it to usdc via the lending join (Dai/Usdc) and return the Usdc. reserve will return the reserve inside the contract in dai,token - this is based on the uniswap reserve() call. Additional specification: The same level of debt is maintained for both positions (the leverage urn and the gem urn).  image681\u00d7761 29.7 KB   MIP32c2: The Lending Join This uses a classic maker join with on top the conversion from and to the lender. There is an additional method harvest() behind an allowlist. The collateral is register and allow borrowing on it exactly like a normal collateral, but the lending join lends it to compound. The join is an auth-join type accessible only by the PSM. The extra method \u2018harvest()\u2019 have 2 actions:  move the excess token to the delegator. move the bonus token to the delegator.  The join has one external methods  exit(address guy, uint256 amount)  The join has two authenticated methods  join(address guy, uint256 amount)  harvest() : To move excess to the delegator  The join also has forth admin methods   file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address  cage() : To cage the join  The join has one parameter:   excess_delegator : excess Delegator address  Additional specification: In order to calculate the excess, we add a total variable which represent the amount own by the join. Then we subtract this amount from the lendler underlying collateral.  image651\u00d7541 19.4 KB   MIP32c3: The Burn Delegator The Delegator is replaceable, its main purpose is to manage the token conversion and what we do with it. This delegator has three public methods:   processUsdc() convert the usdc to dai via the psm.  processComp() convert token bonus to dai via uniswap.  processDai()  convert dai to MKR via uniswap and burn the MKR.  The join also has forth admin methods   file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address  cage() : To cage the join  There are six parameters :   psm : psm address - can be changed  route : uniswap route address - can be changed  bonus_auction_duration: min time is sec between 2 uniswap swap  max_bonus_auction_amount : max comp amount by swap.  dai_auction_duration: min time is sec between 2 uniswap swap  max_dai_auction_amount : max dai amount by swap.   MIP32c4: The Harvest contract This contract will have only one external method harvest() which calls the authenticated harvest() method from the join. Two contract will be deployed to call both join. This contract has only one public methods:   harvest() call harvest from the join  We separated this method from the PSM to allow more flexibility for update.  MIP32c5: Proposed code The code : dds-psm-cme   DssPsmCme.sol   BurnDelegator.sol   LendingHarvest.sol   join-lending-auth.sol   spell-DssPsmCme    MIP32c6: Test cases Unit tests:  DssPsmCme.t.sol BurnDelegator.t.sol LendingHarvest.t.sol join-lending-auth.t.sol   MIP32c7: Security considerations  Compound technical risk Errors or security vulnerabilities in the Compound system could result in the underlying USDC deposits to be lost or stolen.  Implementation technical risk In addition to the technical risk inherent to Compound, the adapter implementation itself is non-trivial and could increase the attack/error surface. Due to the design of multi-collateral DAI, worst-case losses should be limited to the collateral deposited in the adapter, and the debt ceiling should be set with this in mind. There is security consideration about the code itself, compound tokens. In this implementation as we don\u2019t use leverage on compound, the c-token can\u2019t be sized. Another risk: uniswap interaction, but limited to the extra bonus.  MIP32c8: Licensing  AGPL3+  ",

I will push another MIP for it as it is very similar to this one but with more complexity/more risk. @Replenish2030 don\u2019t get it wrong in that case we push the overflowed Dai into compound and remove the underflowed dai from compound. I don\u2019t think it will serve compound on a long term as they will face the same problem as we are currently facing. You might think that will help them by increasing their exposure but it also creates a lot of instability into their price which is what maker is selling at the end of the day - a fixed rate and an understanding price. However, I think if this situation last - difficulty to sell our debt position - I agree we will need to integrate with Aave too. But my hope is that by the end of this year with RWA, we will be able to sell all our debt position and more instead of using second market lending. ",

Sentence Summary This proposal define a new Peg Stability Module which converts USDC to DAI and DAI to USDC, during the conversion it lends and farm the gem via lender token and leverage the position using cdai using the same technique to farm it too.  Paragraph Summary The PSM Compound Mixed Exposure With Farming is based on the PSM Compound Mixed Exposure MIP32 but with two farming join on each token (cDai and cUsdc). The join use the generic \u2018maker join\u2019 interface. It takes as input a collateral, lends and farm it behind the scene to compound, on the output the join redeems the position and return the collateral. This PSM will have 2 urns one cDai and one cUsdc which are both leverage in compound, but the maker position for this PSM is still on uscd and dai.  Component Summary MIP35c1: The PSM Contains snippet of proposed implementation. MIP35c2: The Lending Join MIP35c3: The Burn Delegator MIP35c4: The Harvest Contract MIP35c5: Proposed Code MIP35c6: Test cases Lists existing test cases MIP35c7: Security considerations Comments on the security implications MIP35c8: Licensing States the license under which the proposal and code are distributed.  Motivation Currently, the usdc token inside the PSM is inefficient and needs to be diversified. By using cDai and cUsdc and farm them we will bring more diversification. The farming bring more risk as the token is locked as collateral, but it is also motivated by a better outcome.  Specification The PSM Mixed Exposure is articulated around 3 main components:   The PSM (entry point) - Same as MIP32   The New Farming Join   The excess delegator (excess token conversion) - Same as MIP32   The harvest contract - Same as MIP32    MIP35c1: The PSM We reuse the MIP32 component and plug the new farming join on it. It has three methods:  sell(address usr, uint256 gemAmt) buy(address usr, uint256 gemAmt) reserve()  It also has three admin methods   file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address  There are three prameters:   tin : The fraction of the Gem \u2192 Dai transaction sent to the vow as a fee. Encoded as tin in wad units.  tout: The fraction of the Dai \u2192 Gem transaction sent to the vow as a fee. Encoded as tout in wad units.  line: The maximum amount of Usdc owns by the PSM. Encoded as line in wad units.  sell will take in input usdc, convert usdc into dai via the new farming join (usdc/dai). Then it will take the dai and convert it to dai via another farming join (Dai/Dai) and take the fees and return the Dai. buy will take in input dai, convert the dai after fee into dai via the farming join (dai/dai). Then it will take the dai and convert it to usdc via the farming join (Dai/Usdc) and return the Usdc. reserve will return the reserve inside the contract in dai,token - this is based on the uniswap reserve() call. Additional specification: The same level of debt is maintained for both positions (the leverage urn and the gem urn).  image681\u00d7761 29.7 KB   MIP35c2: The Farming Join The Farming Join is a new Join. It uses the same join interface as MIP32. A classic join interface with an additional method harvest() behind an allowlist. The join has one external methods  exit(address guy, uint256 amount)  The join has two authenticated methods  join(address guy, uint256 amount)  harvest() : To move excess to the delegator  The join also has forth admin methods   file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address  cage() : To cage the join  The join has seven parameters :   excess_delegator The delegator address.  excess_margin Margin amount until we start sending asserts to the delegator.  cf_target The compound coefficient target in WAD  cf_max The coefficient max in WAD. It overrides the compound provided max coefficient, this parameter is here for safety. If it is set above the compound value the join will take the compound one.  route The uniswap contract to swap token.  max_bonus_auction_amount Max amount we send to uniswap each time - to figth against eventual attack and slippage.  bonus_auction_duration Minimun time between two uniswap auction.  The collateral is register against the vat and allow borrowing on it exactly like a normal collateral, but the farming join lends, and farm the collateral with compound. The join is an auth-join type accessible only by allow list.   The exposure is adjusted to the coefficient target each time we remove or add some assert to the vault. Join(), exit() and harvest().   The coefficient target is calculated by using the minimum between : - 98% of the compound maximum coefficient - 98% of cf_max - cf_target If cf_target is set above the maximum coefficient we use 98% of the maximum coefficient for target as safety.   After join(), exit() and harvest() we check with compound the status of our position and reject the transaction if the vault in a liquidation stage.   We wind and Unwind our position using a loop, we borrow and mint or redeemUnderlying and repayBorrow up to 99% of the max allowed by compound to reach the cf_target. The last iteration will exit the loop.   harvest() method will first check if we have a position superior at 100.1% in compound of the underlying collateral to allow a exit from the join in good order. Please Note, Farming can bring a risk of losing some part of the main collateral.   if we don\u2019t hold the position and if we hold COMP we process to an uniswap auction using the parameters max_bonus_auction_amount and bonus_auction_duration to limit the frequency and the amount. We auction an amount up to max comp or the corresponding dai to go up to 100.1% + excess_margin   if we hold the position  we move the excess token minus the excess_margin to the delegator. we move the bonus token to the delegator.     image651\u00d7541 19.4 KB   MIP35c3: The Burn Delegator We reuse the MIP32 component This delegator has three public methods:   processUsdc() convert the usdc to dai via the psm.  processComp() convert token bonus to dai via uniswap.  processDai()  convert dai to MKR via uniswap and burn the MKR.  The join also has forth admin methods   file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address  cage() : To cage the join  There are six parameters :   psm : psm address - can be changed  route : uniswap route address - can be changed  bonus_auction_duration: min time is sec between 2 uniswap swap  max_bonus_auction_amount : max comp amount by swap.  dai_auction_duration: min time is sec between 2 uniswap swap  max_dai_auction_amount : max dai amount by swap.   MIP35c4: The Harvest contract This contract will have only one external method harvest() which calls harvest from the join. Two contract will be deployed to call both join. This contract has only one public methods:   harvest() call harvest from the join  We separated this method from the PSM to allow more flexibility for update.  MIP35c5: Proposed code The code : dds-psm-cme   DssPsmCme.sol   BurnDelegator.sol   LendingHarvest.sol   join-lending-leverage-auth.sol   spell-DssPsmCme-with-farming    MIP35c6: Test cases Unit tests:  DssPsmCme.t.sol BurnDelegator.t.sol LendingHarvest.t.sol join-lending-leverage-auth.t.sol   MIP35c7: Security considerations  Compound technical risk Errors or security vulnerabilities in the Compound system could result in the underlying USDC deposits to be lost or stolen.  Implementation technical risk In addition to the technical risk inherent to Compound, the adapter implementation itself is non-trivial and could increase the attack/error surface. Due to the design of multi-collateral DAI, worst-case losses should be limited to the collateral deposited in the adapter, and the debt ceiling should be set with this in mind. There is security consideration about the code itself, compound tokens. In this implementation as we use leverage on compound, the c-token can be sized. By using leverage on compound we also expose ourself to a lost of the assert which is currently compensated by COMP token. Another risk: uniswap interaction, but limited to the extra bonus.

Here the module, plug them in series so usdc -> dai  then dai -> dai. so the end user will have a usdc -> dai conversion. But on our end you will have 1 cUsdc and 1 cDai in each vault. There is no magic our main limitation here is the Dai supply as the convertor is used the supply will increase and the dai price will fail twice as fast as a normal psm. The main issue with the PSM is that it levels the dai at one price 1.01or 0.99 this one will actually push the peg down or up. I don\u2019t think, there is no accounting issue here. Actually I don\u2019t think I understand what you mean by accountant to look at the legal behind it. ",

                    "content": "What i mean by accounting issues really boils down to whether or not there is an issue with lending an encumbered asset. Would that be considered legal for a traditional company? DAI isn\u2019t just some 1 dollar currency to the protocol. Its an obligation to provide 1 dollars worth of collateral back at emergency shutdown. IMO that is why @SebVentures calls it a liability in this post. So like seb says in order to buy anything the protocol \u201cexpands it balance sheet\u201d and purchases the asset in question be that a loan or usdc or whatever, but what this basically means it is doing is that it is minting a new liability that it uses to purchase the asset in question. In a sense, these new liabilities (i.e new DAI) basically gives the bearer a lien on the asset that was bought. This is because that dai is redeemable for $1 worth of collateral at ES (see this post explaining ES). That being the case, would it be legal for maker (assuming it existed in the traditional fiance world) to give a purchased asset (which has a lien associated with it) to compound and then receive some cToken that is supposed to be redeemable for the face value of the initial collateral + interest. I know i can\u2019t just give my house to someone and receive some IOU from them for a bigger house without paying back my lender first. My guess (im not a lawyer or an accountant) is that isn\u2019t legal unless you first have equity in the underlying asset. Meaning you first need to pay down the DAI liability to some extent before you are able to give any USDC to compound for investment purposes. ",

The 100.1% is here to cover the eventuality of a negative interest with no COMP - it gives us probably around 2 weeks to take action ( with 0.1% over collateralization). However, there is a risk that cToken can\u2019t provide the full amount promised during the redeem - sort of real world company bankruptcy where you get only 1/2 of your money -. This risk is probably the same with any others collateral. I believe the overall risk is the same as the cropJoin one which has been evaluated already for cUsdc risk evaluation . ",

The PSM-USDC is ours (MakerDAO), not of the users! We are bagholders. It is true that the DAI generated with the PSM (from USDC), and introduced in the DeFi ecosystem, is backed only as long as we have the USDC or anything worth at least as much. But as @SebVentures said, our only responsibility as MakerDAO is to keep all DAIs backed. So we should, potentially, be able to invest the USDC in the PSM. If we screw up (e.g., yesterday\u2019s yEarn hack), we will have to print MKR to compensate for that. But we are free to do whatever we want with the USDC in the PSM, as far as I understand. ",

I mean if someone deposits DAI we can just repay the DAI debt of the USDC urn to release the corresponding USDC to be sent to the buyer. Nothing wrong with the design itself, but it makes things more complicated and links our cUSDC exposure with cDAI exposure. I think it\u2019s better to have out cDAI exposure managed by something else. The proposal could also be improved if we can set a limit to the amount converted as cUSDC. Managing out USDC exposure and the cUSDC one should be separated. For instance, if we have too much cUSDC we might pressure the USDC lending/borrowing rate on compound which might have bad implications. I\u2019m fully behind the idea to put those assets at work, just think that we are not yet at the implementation phase. But it can be an experimentation if that doesn\u2019t take too much SC time.

                    "content": "First thanks for this feedback. Regarding the line, it is actually a good idea. I currently have a cage() - flag instead of a limit - which is not yet in this spec. I will remove it and add the line parameter which is more flexible than an on/off. the cage is on the sell only as we want to allow the unwinding in good order. There is still a possibility to un-auth the PSM from the join in case of bad event. Regarding the mix cDai and cUsdc I can see at least 3 reasons - for reference my first idea was to plug it to the PSM directly, but it evolved, I will explain why. but before, the join is generic and can be plug on a normal PSM (probably need to redeploy the existent one as we can\u2019t change the join on it) or be used like the usdc join if we remove the auth. So the reasons are : 1 - We can\u2019t have market gap on Dai to Dai so we can\u2019t have a sort of automation to fill up cDai with a Dai to Dai exchange. To fill up the usdc we use the market gap between Usdc and Dai. By plugin them in serie we use the usdc/dai market gap to fill up cDai. 2 - It gives us more diversification and cDai looks actually a better assert to have. 3 - Probably the most important one and also more complex to explain. With the normal PSM we create a marginal trading line around both limit. 1.01 or 9.99. Currently as soon as the USDC at 0% will be removed or empty we will have the Dai going up or down to one of the lines and margin trading won\u2019t let it go. the Dai will peg to 1.01 or 0.99. As you can buy and sell to this limit. What happen with margin trading in this case is you buy 1000200 and you sell 1000000 but that doesn\u2019t move the price, it just trim it . The difference here is for 1usdc bought we inject 2dai, it creates a pressure so you can\u2019t just sell, buy sell buy around the limit. Now what happen with this PSM, you will trim the top and inject 1 million into the market indirectly which will push the peg down and in theory de-peg the 1.01 or 0.99 limit. I am not too sure we don\u2019t need it to be honest, but I also believe we don\u2019t need it right-now. ",
