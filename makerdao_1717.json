                    "content": " PECU Announcement: Maker Protocol, the Merge and Future Forks of Ethereum Due to recent questions from the community, the following guide provides context and information about replay attacks, a potential Ethereum hard fork, and potential effects on MakerDAO contracts. It also details risks of using DAI\u2019s permit function on all Ethereum mainnet forks. None of the following information constitutes advice of any form. After years of extensive testing and work, the transition to proof of stake Ethereum is ready, and is expected to take place between Sept 14-15th 2022. However, in the last few months, miners along with other parties have raised the possibility of a hard fork of Ethereum, creating a proof of work chain (PoW) as well as a proof of stake chain (PoS).  What\u2019s the consensus? In general, most protocols and companies are opting for support of the PoS chain, with kingmakers such as USDC issuer Circle , oracle provider ChainLink and WBTC custodian BitGo already announcing support for the PoS chain. BitGo\u2019s announcement states the following:  BitGo protects all transactions originating from our platform against replay attacks; for example if you have a confirmed transaction on the PoS chain (which will maintain the current chain ID), then that transaction cannot be \u201creplayed\u201d on a given forked chain, as the latter will necessarily have a different chain ID.  It is important to emphasise BitGo\u2019s mention of replay attacks because one cannot be certain that PoW ETH will change chainId to allow for a smooth hard fork to occur, as described below:  Tweet 11182\u00d71214 105 KB  *This issue has been raised already.  PoW_PRs730\u00d7246 54.1 KB  Open pull requests changing the chain ID remain unmerged. Based on this, it appears that there is a non-zero chance that PoW ETH will use the same chainId as PoS ETH. The following discussion assumes that the chainId of the PoW fork will be 1. Let\u2019s discuss why this may have adverse affects and how users can minimise the risk of being affected by this.  What is a replay attack? A replay attack is taking a transaction from one network and using it on another network. If you sent someone 100 wETH on the PoW fork; you wouldn\u2019t want this action to be repeatable on the Ethereum mainnet without your permission, however replay attacks make this possible. In more detail, a replay attack involves taking a transaction on PoW ETH and replaying it on PoS ETH. EIP-155 was implemented to prevent replay attacks by using a unique chainId value for different networks (such as Binance Smart Chain and Polygon as well as testnets like Rinkeby and Goerli) however if the same chainId is used on two networks, replay attacks become possible again.  How do replay attacks affect DAI and MKR owners? Replay attacks are not specific to DAI or MKR tokens - raw ether, ERC20 tokens, ERC721 NFTs and all other digital assets can be transferred through replay attacks. Any transaction broadcast to the PoW network can be replayed on the PoS network if they share the same chainId. Some examples of interactions which may be replayable:  Interacting with any Maker contracts on PoW directly (from the same address you used before the fork) Selling PoW DAI or MKR tokens to someone in a peer-to-peer transaction Interacting with PoW DAI or MKR tokens via a dApp (such as selling them on UniSwap)  In summary: anything you do on PoW ETH may be able to be replayed on PoS ETH and you should assume that it can be replayed on PoS.  How do replay attacks affect Maker Protocol beyond this? Users should be aware and cautious of the above risks. Here are the main elements of the DSS system which may cause issues:  Oracles The median.sol contract (part of the  oracle module) does not have any verification of chainId value, meaning that PoS asset prices can be used (via replay attacks) to \u201cforce\u201d the MCD system to \u201cwork\u201d. While this would keep the price of DAI at $1 in theory, forcing PoS oracle values into PoW MCD would likely overvalue the underlying collateral, meaning that DAI on PoW would be backed by less value in reality than the system would think. At this point, undercollateralized PoW DAI is not expected to impact PoS DAI. Median can be used to force DSS to keep operating on PoW based on PoS price feeds, however the true collateralisation ratio will be much, much lower than target.  DAI token The DAI token contract is immutable and was provided a chainId in it\u2019s constructor. The DAI  permit derives the digest from the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR which is based on the  chainId provided in the constructor rather than the current chainId. This makes interactions with DAI unsafe on any \u2018proper\u2019 fork (one which changes the chainId) of Ethereum mainnet.  Again, regardless of whether the chainId is updated on the fork, usage of DAI on any fork of mainnet could result in loss of DAI on mainnet via replay attack. The use of permit on any hard fork of Ethereum\u2019s current state could be used to transfer users\u2019 funds via a replay attack on other forks, including mainnet.  What does this mean for DAI and MKR holders? Here are some options for PoW chain interaction, from safest to riskiest:  Do not interact with the PoW fork at all (no interactions at all). Do not interact with MKR, DAI or any MakerDAO associated contracts on the PoW fork. Interact with the fork, taking extreme precautionary measures and assume that all of your transactions will be replayed on mainnet. Avoid the use of permit and do not assume that DAI will be using the correct price feeds or that it is sufficiently collateralised.   Conclusion If the PoW fork backers decide to use a chainId of 1, the PoW fork will be dangerous for all users, including technical and experienced ones. Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic experienced replay attacks (even with ETC using a chainId of 61) which claimed the funds of new and old investors alike. It is worth noting that interacting with the Maker Protocol on any future fork of Ethereum mainnet\u2019s current state is dangerous - even if the fork uses a different chainId value - due to the aforementioned issues.
