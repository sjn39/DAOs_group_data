(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): rotki is an opensource portfolio tracking and accounting tool that thanks to in large part an optimism grant supports Optimism chain completely. Among other things it detects all optimims token balances for all user addresses, pulls all transactions and decodes them into human readable format and then can create an accounting report with PnL for all addresses in a given time period. What\u2019s more all this is done in a local application without storing your data in external server where they can be hacked/leaked or sold to the highest bidder. Website: https://rotki.com/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/rotkiapp Discord/Discourse/Community: Rotki Other relevant links (including any demos): GitHub - rotki/rotki: A portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting application that protects your privacy Additional team member info (please link): Contributors to rotki/rotki \u00b7 GitHub Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: rotk is a long-running project since 2017 and the team has contributed to it for a long time. Other thant that, the founder (me - Lefteris) has also contributed in multiple ethereum projects since 2014.Among them are: the C++ Ethereum client, solidity compiler, the DAO, raiden network etc. Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): This is not a dapp, so there is no on-chain metrics Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): There is no other opensource and local solution that does what rotki does. There is a ton of SaaS/webapps that do some parts of what we do. Zerion/zapper/debank etc. for portfolio tracking, cointracking, koinly etc. for the accounting part. Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: (Not really deployment but including in production): 2/3/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: This proposal is for having opensource EVM transaction decoders for various Optimism protocols. Just like with ethereum, there is no opensource library/app/code that can take a bunch of transactions and decode them nicely into human readable format.With such code available (and rotki is a good example for it) can feed it transactions and have them decoded into a common event format, suitable for human consumption.So others too can see transactions as nicely as etherscan shows them, or even better depending on the decoded protocol. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: We propose to work on those decoders for various protocols (the biggest ones used in Optimism) and have them available in rotki for end-user consumption and also in our codebase in a modular way (that\u2019s already there) so other devs can just use our code in their apps. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We believe that having opensource code that solves the problem of decoding optimism transactions would help grow the Optimism ecosystem as developer would not need to reinvent the wheel.Say you want to create a python app/webapp that processes Velodrome, or 1inch optimism transactions. You would need to create code to do that. But not if we implement the decoders.If we do they can just go to rotki\u2019s codebase and use them. Btw \u2026 important to note that we already have some decoders for optimism: rotki/rotkehlchen/chain/optimism/modules at develop \u00b7 rotki/rotki \u00b7 GitHub and a lot more for ethereum: rotki/rotkehlchen/chain/ethereum/modules at develop \u00b7 rotki/rotki \u00b7 GitHub Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: Yes. And it\u2019s been completed:  [READY] [GF: Phase 1] rotki - #57 by lefterisjpIn fact this application is building on top of that old grant. Number of OP tokens requested: 40,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A \u2013 we do not have a token How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): 100% allocated to development Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: As far as I understand since this is a builder grant there will be a lockup. Once lockup is done, we will use it to pay our developer salaries. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: This is a continuous development grant. I would consider each milestone to be a full decoder module implemented, and code being in github.We would ofcourse continue to support them, debug them, fix bugs and improve them as protocols change.If I understand correctly since there is a lockup milestones do not really make sense here, but open to discussion with the commitee on what they think is best. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: there is no incentives. This is just to develop opensource code. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): The only accountability I can imagine in such a grant is the link to our github to see the work being done: GitHub - rotki/rotki: A portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting application that protects your privacy Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions EDIT: I have added some extra information regarding the proposal in the next post.

                    "content": "After reading the milestone assessment post and speaking with some reviewers I would like to offer some extra information to help with judging the merit of the proposal. I am adding it as an extra post here since the original post is a copy of the google form used for the application and was not sure if I should edit it.  Milestones As this proposal is to implement code and decoders for an unspecified number of optimism and integrate them into the rotki code and ship them in released versions of rotki it\u2019s a bit hard to pre-set a set of milestones. It\u2019s to support continuous development of rotki in optimism. But what we can do is agree on supporting the biggest TVL projects in optimism, seen here which at the moment of writing would include Velodrome, Aave v3, Curve etc. and add more as time passes going from highest to lowest TVL.  Milestones Composition Supporting means the following for each protocol:  Write the opensource decoders for it, decoding as many events as possible. For optimism protocols the code will be located here. Write the frontend code that renders the results for each decoder in the transactions view. Example screenshot:  FpLTXkdaMAkDNtE1350\u00d7999 146 KB   Include them in a release, so that it\u2019s available to the general public and not only developers. Releases are here: Releases \u00b7 rotki/rotki \u00b7 GitHub    Quarterly updates All of this is opensource and in github, even the binaries for all 3 major OSes, but in order to make it easier for the reviewers to judge progress we can do a quarterly report of which optimism protocols were integrated and in which releases they were included for each quarter.  Team Size This grant is to support the rotki team in developing opensource decoders for various optimism protocols. The team is composed of 8 people right now. But the funding will go towards supporting the development, so only to the developers. It\u2019s very hard to judge costs since there is an 1 year lockup and as such price of OP can vary greatly. The rotki team is currently  1 OPs/HR/all non-coding work person. 4 backend developers (including me). They write the opensource code in the backend that integrates the protocols. The backend is the core of the application and where most of the work is. 2 frontend developers. They write the frontend code that displays the results of the decoded transactions, filters for searching etc. 1 designer for the frontend (new addition - just started!)  The team members can be all found here: Contributors to rotki/rotki \u00b7 GitHub. Along with how much work they do. It\u2019s all open! The power of opensource and working in the open. The ones included in the team from the link above and towards whom funding would go are: lefterisjp (B), kelsos(F), yabirgb(B), lukicenturi(F), nebolax(B), prettirrelevant(B). B stands for backend and F for frontend.  Attracting more developers to optimism Naturally one of the main point of these grants is to also attract more developers to Optimism. As these protocols decoders are open other users can integrate them in their projects. The only requirement is that they use python. There is projects that already do that and are based on rotki\u2019s code. One prime example is buchfink: GitHub - coinyon/buchfink: Plaintext Crypto Portfolio With having optimism well supported with a rich set of transaction decoders for its protocols this could attract more python developers to Optimism as opposed to other L2s or chains.
