                    "content": "Dear Community, In February, we started working with the @strat-fin-core-unit on the legal review in connection with our upcoming request to increase debt ceiling and bring in a trustee to oversee our vault. Thank you to the CU and to the @Recognized-Delegates for your support in this process. Our intent is to complete the necessary diligence work and ask for a vote within 30 days. In macro conditions, we have seen an upwards move in a lot of growth equities, as well as cryptos, with the expectation that the Fed is tapering their hawkish stance. However, job numbers came in stronger than expected this month, signaling a strong economy, and the market is anticipating a 5.25-5.50% Fed rate this year, thus expecting 3 additional 25bps increases. In US housing, some institutions have started to change their outlook to a more positive one, and some are calling a bottom in US housing. In geographies where New Silver operates, we have not seen any price decreases thus far, which seem to be concentrated mostly in the Western U.S. markets, though we have seen y/y price deceleration, as well as decrease in demand, in line with what has been projected. Our model for originations still takes in a conservative 5% price decrease over the next 12 months. Here is the latest US real estate market overview from realtor.com:  The number of homes for sale has increased by 65.5% compared to last year. The total number of unsold homes, including homes that are under contract, has increased by 13.1% compared to last year. Home sellers are less active this year, with 5.4% fewer homes being listed for sale compared to last year. The median price of homes for sale has increased by 8.1% annually in January, only slightly less than December\u2019s growth rate. Homes are spending 75 days on the market, which is 13 days longer than last year but still shorter than before the pandemic.
