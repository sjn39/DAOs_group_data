Contracts and API are fully open source Optimism native? Yes, and exclusive. Date of deployment on Optimism: Deployed 6/2/2022 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? The Optimism ecosystem needs to grow substantially in the midst of significant headwinds from both competing ecosystems and macroeconomic forces. A strong secondary economic engine that creates access to deep ecosystem liquidity is a dependency for growth; indeed, the Optimism Foundation has identified the lack of such an engine as one of Optimism\u2019s greatest growth impediments. New projects need resources to quickly and efficiently bootstrap initial liquidity, while existing ones need to sustain and grow their liquidity at minimal cost. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Put simply, our unique public good Optimism-native protocol design makes it simple for protocols to bootstrap and build liquidity faster and with fewer resources, returning 100% of the value generated created back to them. Optimism incentives on Velodrome are essentially a 2x-3x multiplier of liquidity incentives - including grants - for the ecosystem at large, making it easier for protocols to onboard onto Optimism and cheaper for them to operate, resulting in lower burn rates for $OP and project\u2019s native tokens as compared to direct LP incentives. On Velodrome, protocols create revenue-positive liquidity programs that will sustain them and the ecosystem at large for years to come. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Velodrome is already demonstrating our ability to drive significant ecosystem growth. We are doing this by not only helping to attract and onboard new projects to Optimism, but also by lowering the operational costs associated with maintaining liquidity for existing protocols. By reducing costs ecosystem-wide, we are allowing protocols to reinvest in themselves and helping to ensure their sustainability through adverse economic conditions. And because the economic activity that Velodrome generates occurs exclusively on Optimism, it drives significant sequencer revenue, supporting the broader vision of self-sustaining retroactive public good funding. Since launch Velodrome has generated over 2.5M transactions, averaging 25K daily in the last 90 days (~15% of all transactions on Optimism), and has distributed over $6M in $VELO liquidity incentives, approximately at $300K per week, to support the high level of trading activity. What makes Velodrome different than other AMMs on Optimism? Velodrome is a next generation Optimism native AMM that combines some of the best mechanisms from Curve, Convex, and UniV2 into a single cohesive experience. Velodrome\u2019s status as an Optimism exclusive public good aligns its incentives entirely with those of the ecosystem. It also ensures that all the economic activity generated by the protocol (emissions, governance, bribes, fees, LPs) stays on Optimism, supporting sequencer revenue and the broader Optimism flywheel. Velodrome has the lowest fees on Optimism (0.02%) and supports the efficient swapping of both stable and volatile pairs, consistently attracting high volume per $ of TVL and TVL per LP incentives. We are the only AMM on Optimism that supports native governance and bribing, with no need to bridge capital or assets to main-net to participate. Additionally, 100% of the revenue generated by the protocol is returned to $veVELO lockers (primarily partner protocols) on Optimism rather than being redirected to mainnet stakers. Enabling protocols the ability to maintain deep liquidity at very competitive rates. Essentially, Velodrome operates as an extension of Optimism itself, augmenting the economic engine of $OP incentives with $VELO as well as the business development / onboarding arms of the Foundation. Rapidly accelerating ecosystem growth and sustainability.  Previous Grant History  Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? We received a 3,000,000 $OP grant from the Optimism Foundation Partner Fund in July. Existing incentives are likely to be exhausted in next 4-8 weeks in alignment with the distribution timeline encouraged by the Foundation. This grant had three primary objectives:  Lowering barriers to entry with locking incentives Boosting ecosystem efficiency with bribe matching Building deep liquidity on key ecosystem pairs  The results of this program so far have been overwhelming:  Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 11.32.461920\u00d71078 92.6 KB   A consistent top 3 protocol by TVL, volume, transactions, and users $6M+ VELO liquidity incentives distributed into the ecosystem (2-3x OP grant) 30 new protocols onboarded and supported with liquidity growth in ecosystem 30-70% reduction in liquidity incentive costs per $ TVL for ecosystem partners $5M+ liquidity of OP token pairs, creating $1B in volume $1M+ in protocol revenue returned to veVELO lockers (primarily protocols) $10M+ value locked as veVELO (70% of total) locked into the Optimism for ~3.5ys $250k veVELO airdrop for OP Team, $2M veVELO airdrop to ecosystem partners Highly engaged community of 8,400+ Discord members, 44K Twitter followers   Screen Shot 2022-10-14 at 12.06.161448\u00d7808 204 KB  Since receiving the grant, Velodrome has exploded in almost every metric:   TVL: 400%+ increase, from $14M to $80M+ (as high as $150M)  Weekly Fees: 500%+ increase, from $3.3K to $20K  Cumulative Volume: 700%+ increase, from $270M to $2.2BN+  Average Daily Volume: 150%+ increase, from $2.2M to $4.5M+  VELO Holders: 100%+ increase, from 6.6K to 12.7K  VELO Supply Locked: 70%+ increase, from 219M to 373M+ VELO   Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 13.57.461600\u00d7906 67.2 KB  In summary, the ~3M OP incentives have returned a massive ROI in the form of:  $80M+ in TVL $6M+ in direct liquidity incentives $10M in value locked into the ecosystem $15M in market cap value living exclusively on the Optimism ecosystem   New Grant Request This grant request is focused on extending the duration of the existing incentives whose effectiveness has been demonstrated for the next 6 months in order to maintain the pace and velocity of ecosystem growth it is helping to drive. During this period, Velodrome will also continue to exclusively develop its roadmap for Optimism, focused on a v2 deployment with a number of upgrades:  Velodrome Relay Concentrated liquidity pool types (UniV3 style) Improved veNFT experiences with Quixotic Delegateable OP in LP positions Improved retail oriented UX, e.g.:  Custodial wallets integration Wallet top-ups LP zappers DeFi educational content    While previous grants to protocols of our size (measured by on-chain metrics TVL, volume, transactions) imply a much larger grant, we\u2019ve chosen a lower number with the goal of preserving Governance Funds for other use-cases and even more motional timing. Number of OP Tokens Requested: 4,000,000 OP  98% less than average OP granted per $ in TVL 80% less than median OP granted per $ in TVL 98% less than average OP granted per $ in Volume 65% less than median OP granted per $ in Volume 98% less than average OP granted per transaction 86% less than the median OP granted per transaction 91% less than the average OP granted per user 51% less than the median OP granted per user   Screen Shot 2022-10-20 at 11.29.191920\u00d71076 82.4 KB  Received OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund? Not since original grant detailed above and no new grants are in progress. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Over the next 6 months, Velodrome will distribute ~257M VELO in emissions to liquidity pools. Based on historical results, 85%-90% of these emissions will be directed to pools incentivized through this program: a value of $6.5M at current VELO prices. This not only represents over 1.6x the grant request size but also equals over half of all $OP incentives projected to be distributed via governance over the same period. Likewise, due to the design of our incentive programs, participating protocols are required to provide their matches, which further increases the multiplier effect on the grant.  For every one dollar in lock bonuses, protocols must lock an average of $4 for 4 years For every one dollar in bribe boost, protocols must provide $2 - $9 in bribe value  In short, we will not only be 2-3x the the incentives with our own emissions, but also be requiring each partner to provide a 2x-9x match to access the incentives as well. How will the OP tokens be distributed? Lowering Barriers to Entry with Locking Incentives - 37.5% [1.5M OP] To onboard new protocols to the Optimism ecosystem during uncertain times and in the face of competing incentives, we must ensure that they are able to bootstrap their liquidity in the most cost-effective method possible. At the same time, these incentives should be paired with mechanisms that require protocols to meaningfully invest in the ecosystem for the long term and thus discourage mercenary and exploitative behaviors. Incentivizing the acquisition and locking of veVELO is an ideal strategy in this regard, as it requires a multi-year lock of capital in the ecosystem to receive the lock bonus and access Velodrome\u2019s voting and revenue generation capabilities. It is to our knowledge the only currently running incentive program that requires the locking of capital in the Optimism ecosystem. Incentivizing locking lowers the underlying costs of building an initial veVELO position (by an average of ~25%) while simultaneously giving any protocol the power to direct emissions and attract liquidity for the long term.  Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.49.56 PM1590\u00d7844 142 KB  Overall, the number of tokens per 10k VELO have roughly decreased in the last several epochs due to increased locking, and yet the %rebate has increased due to token price movements. The overall effect has been to increase the per-OP efficiency of this bonus. Token locking also supports the health of the ecosystem by a) reducing the floating supply of VELO, thereby buffering LP incentive returns denominated in VELO; b) aligning incentives between the token holder base and the overall ecosystem, as veVELO holders have a shared interest in the long-term success of Velodrome and Optimism; c) strengthening ties between participating ecosystem protocols, as they not only see aligned incentives but also collaborate as partners and are connected by Velodrome\u2019s external-facing team. Rewarding lockers with OP tokens will not only increase the health of the Velodrome economy but also give more governance power to the deeply invested, long-term supporters Optimism is looking to attract. Since the beginning of the lock bonus on July 7, we\u2019ve generally seen more VELO locked than emitted, with lock rates at 60% - 70% at an average of 3.7+ years.  Screen Shot 2022-10-13 at 12.51.17 PM1596\u00d7714 106 KB    Quantity: 1.5M OP  Delivery: 40K OP incentives per week over 6 months, distributed to veVELO lockers proportionally to new veVELO balance per week, exclusively for transaction locking liquid VELO (no lock extensions or rebases).  KPIs:  Exceeding and maintaining 70% VELO total supply locked Doubling share of OP protocols locking VELO among those with native tokens Attracting additional new protocols to the ecosystem that meaningfully improve layer-wide economic activity     Boosting Ecosystem Efficiency with Bribe Matching - 37.5% [1.5M OP]  As protocols like Curve and Convex have demonstrated, bribe-for-emission models are far more capital efficient than direct incentives in the attraction of liquidity, and Velodrome remains the only AMM in the Optimism ecosystem that supports native bribing. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that bribing for emissions has been massively popular on Velodrome for both new and existing protocols, allowing them to draw significant liquidity at roughly 1/3 the cost of doing so with direct LP incentives. To date, we have been matching partner bribes at a 25% - 75% rate, lowering the underlying cost basis of bribing and facilitating the migration of incentives from Mainnet and other networks. This program has been an unalloyed success, with cumulative bribes, total bribed pools, and number of protocols bribing rising almost monotonically since inception. After kicking off the bribe economy, Velodrome\u2019s incentive program has shifted to mostly supporting partner liquidity. Partner bribe matches are growing weekly as more protocols migrate to Optimism and are expected to make up the majority of Velodrome\u2019s OP incentives in the coming months. Over time, partner bribes have taken over the majority of bribe value, greatly reducing reliance on Velodrome incentives.

Through the bribe matching program, Velodrome will continue to support partner onboarding and enable the bribe economy to take life of its own. Extending this program for 6 months will be crucial to strengthen our partners\u2019 liquidity depth and give them enough time to evaluate the results of their incentive programs. The expectation is that we can foster enough new building on Optimism to draw the kind of activity and ensuing liquidity demand that will fully kick off broad exploitation of the Velodrome economy.   Quantity: 1.5M OP  Delivery: 40K OP per week for 6-8 months.  KPIs:  Increasing the total numbers of protocols bribing Increasing number of total pools bribed Increasing the total value bribed in $ / ETH terms     Building Deep Liquidity on Key Ecosystem Pairs - 25% [1M OP]  For Optimism (and Velodrome) to succeed, they need to attract far more liquidity on core token pairs from Mainnet Ethereum and ensure that core ecosystem pairs that support the broader Optimism flywheel such as $OP and $VELO remain deeply liquid on chain. This is essential not only to support the onboarding of capital to the ecosystem, but supporting the broader economy. Generally speaking, these pools need to be deep enough to support the lowest fee and slippage trades for the large transactions types that tend to make up a disproportionate share of volume on Mainnet and allow easy entry/exit for those looking to engage with the ecosystem. Establishing this pool depth will create a virtuous cycle of capital migration, as the resulting economic activity will make Optimism the ideal venue for both trading and LPing DEXs across the network. We thus believe it is essential to continue supporting Velodrome emissions for key public good pools that benefit the ecosystem collectively. So far, these pools have been massively successful, attracting >$30m in liquidity and generating $1B+ in volume since launch.  Because the Optimism Foundation is legally unable to bribe these pools directly, Velodrome will commit to bribing and boosting the votes of these key pairs to ensure they will attract the votes/emissions to build deep liquidity at no additional cost to the ecosystem protocols that depend on them. Key pairs include:     Pair Current Liquidity 24H Volume (Oct 13) 30-Day Avg Volume     OP - USDC $4M $850K $1.6M   WETH - USDC $3M $700K $1.3M   sUSD - USDC $17M $240K $323K   wstETH - WETH $12M $220K $123K   sETH - WETH $8M $140K $131K   MAI - USDC $7.1M $340K $302K   LUSD - USDC $3.8M $18K $62K   OP - WETH $500K $85K $183K      Quantity: 1M OP  Delivery: 30k OP per week for 6-8 months.  KPIs:  Increasing TVL for ecosystem pairs High number of transactions Low slippage for high volume trades     Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?  The purpose of the Governance Fund is \u201cto incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem.\u201d This growth is intended to bring to the \u201ccity of Optimism\u201d a broad base of projects, capital, and users that can create a self-sustaining economy, driving exponential growth for all. Much like the Optimism sequencer itself, our success as a public good depends entirely on the health of that broader economy; this utility is designed to be entirely permissionless and sustainable once an economy of a sufficient size exists to support it. To put this another way, incentives will never completely disappear from Velodrome as emissions are designed to run in perpetuity, following a sustainable and predictable schedule (see our docs for details). When combined with incentives generated in perpetuity by Optimism\u2019s retroactive public goods funding, we expect a virtuous cycle that will maintain Velodrome\u2019s status as the premiere base liquidity layer for the ecosystem for years to come. We have strong conviction that Optimism will eventually catch up to the level of activity we see on Mainnet today, attracting billions in annual trading volume. At 10% of Mainnet\u2019s current volume, Velodrome\u2019s fees would yield a 30% return per year for veVELO holders at current value. The incentive program proposed above extends Velodrome\u2019s built ability to stimulate the broader economy while the natural tailwinds of Optimism\u2019s growth continue to accelerate. Once OP incentives end, protocols, organizations, and retail players alike will hold long-term veVELO positions, which will allow them to further direct VELO liquidity incentives while sharing in the upside of Velodrome\u2019s and Optimism\u2019s success.  Moreover, the fact of being able to sustain those APRs, along with the continued presence and building of these partners, would amplify any future liquidity mining rewards they choose to implement. More broadly, we\u2019re not just targeting users or capital: we\u2019re targeting projects. Doing so allows us to avoid some of the pitfalls of simple liquidity mining in that development work and network connections derived from that are inherently stickier than capital drawn in by high APRs. Once partners work with us, they tend to want to continue to do so, and creating a scene of builders organically is in our view one of the primary ways that Optimism will be able to sustain its growth, shore up the value and quality of its governance, and successfully deliver on its ideals. In a time when there is frankly a diminished user base crypto-wide, it is of primary importance that Optimism use the current moment to direct its resources toward facilitating infrastructural development, setting up the conditions for the ecosystem to thrive when end users do return.  Update  Based on feedback from key delegates and Optimism governance participants, we propose staging the delivery of the grant to allow for evaluation of its effectiveness. Details as follows:  Maintain grant amount as outlined above, but deliver only half of the funds up front. Deliver a full report on efficacy at the 2.5 month mark, to be submitted directly to governance Upon delivery of the report, open a 2 week window where anyone in governance can raise a proposal that, upon two delegate approvals, can proceed direct to snapshot to suspend further grant payments If none are submitted, funding continues  If successful, a similar staged model could also serve for future large grant requests.

How do proposed alternative metrics benefit the Optimism ecosystem?   Velodrome has gained significant traction in a tough market environment. Losing momentum now will predictably lead to lower liquidity and activity, especially against competing ecosystems with upcoming grant programs such as Arbitrum. Why is waiting for a second stage of grants preferable to continuing the current program? Stopping and restarting incentives is measurably less efficient than extending a program.   We specifically included data and a visual representation on efficiency of OP incentives and Velodrome is a clear leader. Would you propose an alternative grant size for a protocol attracting ~15% of the ecosystems transaction volume and ~10% of TVL?   ",

                    "content": "First, very well written and researched proposal with an incredible data set. From my own research and understanding of dexes, you generally want deep liquidity and volume in what I like to call the base pairs. Network Coin + Dominant Stable. For Optimism that is clearly ETH/USDC, on top of that I can understand OP/ETH AND OP/USDC since we all understand that deep liquidity on OP as a token can only be a good thing. But then some of the other pairs become a bit difficult, I added a column here of what I call ratio, the 24H Volume divided by Liquidity. From my understanding this is the actual information we want to analyze pairs for since it\u2019s what ultimately drives usage.     Pair Current Liquidity 24H Volume Ratio 7D Volume Ratio     OP - USDC $4,000,000.00 $850,000.00 21.25% $10,359,358.00 258.98%   WETH - USDC $3,000,000.00 $700,000.00 23.33% $6,577,178.00 219.24%   OP - WETH $500,000.00 $85,000.00 17.00% $869,076.00 173.82%   MAI - USDC $7,100,000.00 $340,000.00 4.79% $2,050,891.00 28.89%   sETH - WETH $8,000,000.00 $140,000.00 1.75% $1,025,624.00 12.82%   sUSD - USDC $17,000,000.00 $240,000.00 1.41% $1,935,689.00 11.39%   wstETH - WETH $12,000,000.00 $220,000.00 1.83% $1,249,708.00 10.41%   LUSD - USDC $3,800,000.00 $18,000.00 0.47% $285,555.00 7.51%   Edit: Added 7D volume         I reordered the information so it goes from biggest ratio to smallest. ETH/USDC + OP/USDC + OP/USDC have all impressive Ratio. MAI/USDC has a great ratio. wstETH/ETH I can understand is a new pair but liquidity depth on that is great, so clearly volume is lagging. After that the shown pairs are not impressive in regards to ratio. Outside of the declared pairs USDC/DAI boasts an impressive swap volume as do some VELO pairs like VELO/USDC and VELO/OP. (I am basing my information on this dune dashboard, Velodrome Finance On Optimism) To the questions:  Both Synthetix and QiDAO have their own proposals and allocations for their tokens, and your proposal shows how the bribe economy is shaping up, but couldn\u2019t the Velodrome incentives be directed to other uses, like a builders grant on top Velodrome? The bribe economy has shown itself to be very effective to attract TVL, looking at Defillama, Optimism holds a very different landscape if we see Volume/TVL metrics Optimism Volumes - DefiLlama. How is the team thinking the competing dex landscape for Optimism specifically? Confirmation request, your proposal doesn\u2019t include any provision for delegation and/or usage of the OP while it\u2019s not being distributed.

Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  seeing the performance of the rest before a second stage of grants is key;   Given that demonstrated effectiveness, the only thing that delaying an extension of Velodrome incentives would achieve is massively slowing the current rate of ecosystem growth while making it harder for existing projects to operate.

Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  Velodrome is in an ideal metric scenario in its sector; since Uniswap is just deciding how it will use the grant and Curve   We have to keep in mind that battle isn\u2019t between DEXs on Optimism, it is in their collective battle for attracting liquidity and builders from mainnet and alt L1s. We\u2019ve been hugely successful in this. Incentives on Uniswap, Curve, Sushi, and Beethoven will have a role to play too, but the ecosystem shouldn\u2019t wait on them to get the ball rolling \u2013 especially given they are not Optimism native and have competing priorities. Once all the programs are live, some comparative analysis would certainly be welcome, but I think that is all the more reason to keep the existing program running. Ending one before the others begin will not just  make it harder for us to collectively attract liquidity from mainnet, but will make it harder to do 1:1 comparative analysis on efficacy. ",

A great question, ser. Because bribing on Velodrome helps to create a 30-70% reduction in liquidity incentive costs for projects, supporting that efficiency is in essence a builder grant. It allows builders to save potentially millions a year in incentive costs, which they can reinvest in their own projects. And they can do this without having to go through some cumbersome process. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to attract over 30 new projects to the network without builder grants (and most haven\u2019t received OP grants either).     Netrim:  The bribe economy has shown itself to be very effective to attract TVL, looking at Defillama, Optimism holds a very different landscape if we see Volume/TVL metrics Optimism Volumes - DefiLlama.   Volume comes with utility and activity. As of now, many of the projects that we\u2019re helping to bootstrap are in their infancy on Optimism. They need some initial liquidity to support their operations, but they are not yet at sufficient maturity to expect their pairs to drive significant volume. That (of course) will come in time as their products are fully developed and more activity migrates to L2. Volume will come once these projects have matured and the ecosystem is booming. That is why it is so important for something like Velodrome to exist at this critical point in ecosystem development.     Netrim:  Confirmation request, your proposal doesn\u2019t include any provision for delegation and/or usage of the OP while it\u2019s not being distributed. Would you consider any of them as possible? if so, please update the main post   We strongly believe protocols and builders need more representation in governance for the ecosystem to be successful. We are supportive of those who have suggested a consistent framework for self-delegation as a norm. That said, it has seemed like enough of a non-negotiable for some that we didn\u2019t feel it was worth including. The most important thing to us at the moment is ensuring ecosystem growth can continue at pace and don\u2019t want to distract from that. ",

Here is what I found: Uniswap: 9 projects, 6 if you filter out ETH/OP/USDC Beethoven: 7 projects, 4 if you filter out ETH/USDC/USDT Curve: 6 projects, 4 if you filter out USDC/USDT Velodrome: 29 projects, 26 if you filter out OP/USDC/ETH This does seem to validate your claim that you have a unique claim on growing and supporting the ecosystem. I was actually quite surprised how limited an impact the others have. I did have one question. If Velodrome is more efficient as you claim, then why is liquidity deeper on tokens like Lyra and Thales on Uniswap and sUSD and sETH on Curve?

Regarding incentive efficiency, the protocols are deploying much higher incentives on Uni and Curve to attract that TVL than on Velodrome. When you compare TVL per $ of incentives, you get some remarkable results. Thales is getting 2.8x TVL per $ of incentives on Velodrome vs Uni and 6.6x the volume per $ incentive!

Because bribing on Velodrome helps to create a 30-70% reduction in liquidity incentive costs for projects, supporting that efficiency is in essence a builder grant. It allows builders to save potentially millions a year in incentive costs, which they can reinvest in their own projects. And they can do this without having to go through some cumbersome process. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to attract over 30 new projects to the network without builder grants (and most haven\u2019t received OP grants either).   Having said that I feel like neither Synthetix nor QiDAO need the Velodrome bribes on top, since they have their own proposals and usage to be distributed. Couldn\u2019t this part of bribes be directed to composability on top of Velodrome? A builder\u2019s grant is much more than simply giving away incentives, for instance Interest Protocol had a solution for composability of OP that would let you keep your voting power even when using said OP. Having that sort of composability on top of Velodrome LPs would be great.     alexcutlerdoteth:  We strongly believe protocols and builders need more representation in governance for the ecosystem to be successful. We are supportive of those who have suggested a consistent framework for self-delegation as a norm. That said, it has seemed like enough of a non-negotiable for some that we didn\u2019t feel it was worth including. The most important thing to us at the moment is ensuring ecosystem growth can continue at pace and don\u2019t want to distract from that.   I understand where you are coming from here and you guys need to pick your battles, but I still feel like it\u2019s a missed opportunity to discuss this. As per the proposal this would run over 6 to 8 months, let\u2019s settle on 6 months. 4M OP ~10% APY would give you ~1k OP per day, which could then be set aside to keep on growing even if the 4M start being distributed. On a very ideal scenario, Velodrome could amass their own self reliant OP stash to use and my own understand is that those could be used as the team/DAO (if applicable) see fit. ",

I am with Revest Finance . This about sums up my thoughts on this as well ^^. Velodrome incentivizes liquidity to remain on Optimism as they have clearly shown throughout the first grant - on top of that they have provided sound data that shows the ROI back to the Optimism Chain. Outside of this, in my personal dealings with the Velo team, they are amazing ambassadors for the Optimism Chain - whether it be advice on Op Governance for their (many, many) partners or brainstorming very innovative and creative strategies to lock liquidity on Optimism for the long term. This proposal is well thought out and back up data provided - fundamentals are all there as well - should be a no brainer to pass this in my opinion - will definitely be keeping an eye on how this plays out!

First, the data is great, but I feel some of it is a bit skewed. For example, do I understand correctly, that in the following paragraph Velodrome metrics are being mostly compared to projects without prior incentives? If so, then this comparison seems pretty unfair, since Velodrome\u2019s metrics are obviously pumped up with the existing grant. \"Number of OP Tokens Requested: 4,000,000 OP  98% less than average OP granted per $ in TVL 80% less than median OP granted per $ in TVL 98% less than average OP granted per $ in Volume 65% less than median OP granted per $ in Volume 98% less than average OP granted per transaction 86% less than the median OP granted per transaction 91% less than the average OP granted per user 51% less than the median OP granted per user\"  Additionally, I see great emphasis put on TVL, Volume and # of transactions. TVL is obviously buffed up with the first grant and Volume and # of transactions is pretty much an automatic product of the TVL and low fees of the protocol, but that does not describe how sustainable the model itself is. Maybe you are able to provide information such as protocol revenue (or fees earned) per OP used? Even better if that could be provided in comparison to other DEX projects that have had successful grants. That would be great information to show that what you are building is sustainable (or at least more sustainable than other DEX projects that are/have been applying for grants). All in all, I am wary that most of the data shown in this proposal and current success of the project is mostly based on the first grant and unsustainable in the long-run. Information that proves otherwise would be much appreciated and well received. ",

These are very interesting ideas, ser. I would love to explore them, but simply do not see any way to do so without putting the proposal at risk given the conversation around this topic so far. I think it\u2019s probably best to discuss in the period between seasons (when no proposals will  be live) to see if we can get guidance from the Foundation for a universal solution that can benefit all protocols equally. I hear they may be working on something already.     Netrim:  I feel like we need to move away from straight up liquidity mining incentives.   Exactly right. VELO emissions to boosted pools will represent a 1.6x multiple on the underlying value of the grant alone. This will reduce the need to lean on direct OP grants alone to incentivize liquidity and help the grant programs sustain for a longer period.     Netrim:  Having said that I feel like neither Synthetix nor QiDAO need the Velodrome bribes on top, since they have their own proposals and usage to be distributed. Couldn\u2019t this part of bribes be directed to composability on top of Velodrome?   Are you talking about bribe matching in their cases or treating their pools as \u201cpublic goods\u201d?     Netrim:  Having that sort of composability on top of Velodrome LPs would be great.   Again, I think we\u2019re already seeing a ton of composability on Velodrome without needing to offer targeted grants to create it. Every incentive we offer is (in many ways) a builder grant. In fact, I would guess that after Synthetix we are probably the most built upon protocol on Optimism at the moment. My opinion is that it is much more equitable efficient to do this by reducing costs universally to protocols versus issuing prescriptive / restrictive grants. I\u2019m also skeptical that we have seen any real results from any protocols who included \u201cbuilder grants\u201d as part of their requests, though maybe @jackanorak would know. ",

AAVE got 5M $OP as incentives and did not even force any user or protocol to buy their native token to get the $OP reward. Shame. What kind of marketing is this? And on top of that, they only manage to push their TVL to 600M and now its down to whopping 400M. And its seems their liquidity is not moving much. This is clear, we should not support AAVE as multichain project. Same with Uniswap, they didnt even start their incentives even after getting the fund, its been 4 months. This does not look good, we should ask why?. They are not trying to spend their incentives in hurry to bring liquidity. This raises a question on their long term vision.

I believe Optimism governance is right to support multiple DEXs for a healthy ecosystem early on. As I see it now, grants are going to Uniswap, Curve, Beethoven, Sushi, Zipswap, and Velodrome. They each have different strengths and weaknesses. Some are offering more investment in Optimism and some less. Everyone is proposing plans for incentives that are different in approach. This is a good thing. We should give them all a chance to grow the ecosystem so we can see what works best. Velodrome seems to be working well. If other DEX incentives work well too we can support the extension of them as well. This not zero sum, multiple strong DEXs on Optimism is  good for all. More liquidity and volume is needed. ",

GFXlabs:  This is just a really big price tag   I guess in some sense, we already see the ask as being trimmed relative to every quantitive measure of grants distributed so far as well as the demonstrated 2x-3x ROI / ecosystem growth we\u2019ve demonstrated the initial grant was able to help us deliver. Our request is also unique in that we\u2019re pairing it with a commitment to match 1.6x the grant size ($6.5m) in incentives as well as requirement other projects to match 4x-9x the amounts to access the rewards. In other words, I think the ask only looks big in a vacuum. The ask is actually quite low relative to the matching investment, demonstrated 2x-3x ROI, and baselines from other grants distributed.     GFXlabs:  Your own metrics listed here could be used to argue Velodrome has hit \u201cescape velocity\u201d and does not need further grants.   The goal of the grants are \u201cto incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem.\u201d The use of them on Velodrome creates a multiplier effect for all ecosystem participants as demonstrated by our onboarding of over 30 new protocols to the ecosystem as well as dropping the costs of liquidity across the ecosystem by 30%-70%. It\u2019s less a question of \u201chas Velodrome reached escape velocity\u201d and more a question of \u201chas the ecosystem reached escape velocity\u201d\u2026 and if not, is extending incentives on Velodrome one of the most effective ways to get us there? I hope we\u2019ve demonstrated that.     GFXlabs:  When speaking of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of OP, perhaps it\u2019s better to offer a proposal to sell VELO to governance rather than asking for a grant?   This is an interesting idea that may very well be worth exploring, but I don\u2019t see how it would lead to the same kind of growth multiple for the ecosystem we\u2019ve shown incentives can drive.     GFXlabs:  Alternatively, you could set it up so it\u2019s delivered in monthly tranches after a required report, so governance has an opportunity to monitor the grant. The days of delivering large lump sum grants were not kind, so a sophisticated applicant like Velodrome can probably caress this into a package that sets a great example    This I believe we would be quite open to! My only note would be that we perhaps do it in three month increments to ensure we\u2019re able to gather enough data and control for all the other variables that I\u2019m sure will come our way over a few crazy months in crypto. I think one of the big differentiators here over the original large lump sum grants is that we now have a demonstrated track record as well as results on the programs we\u2019re asking to extend. In many ways, we hope our initiatives being extended will be inspiration for the other big reciepants to start documenting their own efficacy so they have the same chance when it comes time.

Yes, we are saying we have dropped liquidity costs by 30%-70% for the 30+ protocols building on top of us. A functional grant to those builders.     OPUser:  If that\u2019s the case, would you consider allocating funds specifically to builders grant.   Let\u2019s put it this way, you could either cut costs for all projects in a consistent, fair, and permissionless way and allow them to choose how to reinvest those funds (or) you could create yet another grant layer (redundant to this one) that gives us a bunch of power to pick and choose what projects should get funding. Why would anyone choose the latter? Additionally, our program has overwhelming data supporting it\u2019s efficacy with over 30 net new projects onboarded to Optimism and building on top of Velodrome (most of which who have not gotten grants from the foundation). Can you point me to a single data point that any project that included builder grants in their proposals are having comparable impact? You want our team focused on the business development that is driving massive growth, not duplicating the work of governance.

OPUser:  Few pairs I see on the list has their own incentives as pointed out by Netrim.   Again, can you clarify?     OPUser:  One thing I would like to see is reward ratio, how much $OP was spend monthly with respect to revenue generated on the platform.   I\u2019ll let @tao weigh in here, but will reiterate that about 2.5M OP was allocated over a period where Velodrome produced: \u2022 $6M+ VELO liquidity incentives \u2022 $1M+ in protocol revenue \u2022 $5M+ liquidity of OP token pairs \u2022 $10M+ value locked as veVELO \u2022 30-70% reduction in liquidity incentive costs There is no way to frame the existing grant as anything other than returning multiples on the underlying investment.     OPUser:  I am really curious on this, how did you reach to this conclusion? do you have any literature or peer-reviewed journal to support your statement.   Peer reviewed journals? Are you pulling our leg here, ser? It is a public good because it is essential infrastructure that returns 100% of the revenue generated by it back to the ecosystem. Control of the protocol was distributed to not only the Foundation, but every top protocol in the ecosystem  (representing millions in value). It has no outside investors or stakeholders, leaks no value to other chains, and serves as Optimism\u2019s only currently active native liquidity solution. If you are looking for peer review of our public good status, kindly consider the 20+ protocols who have reviewed and cosigned our proposal or the Foundation who bootstrapped us as such. ",

Below, we\u2019ll dive into different aspects of the proposal but first we\u2019d love to know  what\u2019s the Optimism Foundation\u2018s evaluation of the 1st grant? @lavande @bobby  why do you ask the Op gov house for the 2nd grant? @jackanorak @tao @alexcutlerdoteth   1. Grant Goals     tao:  This grant had three primary objectives:  Lowering barriers to entry with locking incentives Boosting ecosystem efficiency with bribe matching Building deep liquidity on key ecosystem pairs    These goals are reasonable for Velo. For the overall DEX ecosystem on Optimism they should be  Lowering barriers to entry Boosting ecosystem efficiency Building deep liquidity on key ecosystem pairs  ( \u2192 $ in the right place to achieve xyz; openness & support for projects to join & contribute to Op) Velodrome had an especially positive impact on the following 3 OP ecosystem goals:  Velodrome has been a key player in onboarding new protocols through personal contact. Velodrome helped bootstrapping pools for projects with locking & strong co-bribing incentives. Establish liquidity for Op & some stablecoins (1inch examples \u2192 trades routed through Velo & Uni)   100 Weth-Op trade853\u00d7501 36.6 KB    \u2192 Why is it that larger trades are routed more through Uni v3? Despite that, Velodrome achieved other project-specific goals:  Large TVL growth veVelo locking from partners (+individuals) User attention & activity     Things that we criticially look at: Deep liquidity on key ecosystem pairs & ecosystem efficiency  Uniswap has been more important for key ecosystem pairs so far without incentives. (Check routing from 1inch for USDC/ETH/WBTC, Op pair somewhat split between Velo & Uni v3) High amount of incentives & TVL compared to trade volume (market share)    image909\u00d7462 28 KB  2. The Ask As mentioned by @GFXlabs @katie, the Ask is very large - especially given in a lump sum. Locking Incentives: 1.5M Op (40K Op per week)  This incentive can help with onboarding projects to Optimism (+) Requiring projects to invest into Velo instead of Op is not optimal in our opinion. We would look at this more postive if projects were to lock Op or an 80/20 position that helps with effective liquidity (\u00b1) You mention competiting incentives: Do you mean within or outside of Optimism? What kind of impact do you expect from full deployments of Curve and the upcoming start of incentives on Uniswap, Curve, Sushi + Velodrome on Velo bribing, efficiency, market share?      tao:  To onboard new protocols to the Optimism ecosystem during uncertain times and in the face of competing incentives, we must ensure that they are able to bootstrap their liquidity in the most cost-effective method possible.       tao:  KPIs:  Exceeding and maintaining 70% VELO total supply locked Doubling share of OP protocols locking VELO among those with native tokens Attracting additional new protocols to the ecosystem that meaningfully improve layer-wide economic activity    Boosting ecosystem efficiency with Bribe Matching: 1.5M Op (40K Op per week)  This could further help with onboarding additional projects & bootstrapping liquidity on Optimism You state that liquidity cost from bribing is cheaper than direct incentives. Do you compare the same incentives on uni v2 or uni v3 as uni v3 might make up for the \u201cextra cost of direct incentives\u201d?      tao:  It\u2019s no surprise, then, that bribing for emissions has been massively popular on Velodrome for both new and existing protocols, allowing them to draw significant liquidity at roughly 1/3 the cost of doing so with direct LP incentives.       tao:  KPIs:  Increasing the total numbers of protocols bribing Increasing number of total pools bribed Increasing the total value bribed in $ / ETH terms    Building deep liquidity on key ecosystem pairs: 1M Op (30K Op per week)  Higher liquidity in top pairs is important for Optimism (IF liquidity is utilized/effective)  Would it not be a better idea to incentivize top pairs on Uni v3 and for example new projects on Velo considering ecosystem efficiency? Do you believe it makes sense to incentivize the same pairs on different DEXs? Despite \u201cslow\u201d market share growth of DEX aggregators on l2s, we strongly believe in abstraction over time & that users move towards wallets with built-in meta-aggregators in low-cost environments. Hence, we\u2019d recommend a focus on protocol efficiency metrics (Slippage, trades (volume) routed, effective liquidity) over adoption KPIs (TVL, direct users, transactions).        tao:  KPIs:  Increasing TVL for ecosystem pairs High number of transactions Low slippage for high volume trades    3. General Ask Justification Probably this doesn\u2019t need to be stated. 4 Mio Op (110K OP per week!) is definitely a huge Ask. We appreciate the depth of the proposal and data provided, some of the \u201ccomparable metrics\u201d are flawed though (apples & oranges) and should at most be used as small indicator in a comprehensive review. Obviously, we should not justify new Asks with previous grant amounts or Op granted/TVL but with value-added from the new proposal. Maybe, this helps anyways to stimulate a discussion which KPIs we should look at to evaluate all the different grants until today. Potentially good KPIs (for long-term sustainable growth initiatives)  Op granted per unique user onboarded Op granted per top project/team onboarded Op granted per new liquidity on Optimism (+ retention, + effectivity, + network effects, + user activity, - user clusters, etc.)      tao:  Number of OP Tokens Requested: 4,000,000 OP  98% less than average OP granted per $ in TVL 80% less than median OP granted per $ in TVL 98% less than average OP granted per $ in Volume 65% less than median OP granted per $ in Volume 98% less than average OP granted per transaction 86% less than the median OP granted per transaction 91% less than the average OP granted per user 51% less than the median OP granted per user    4. Overall: It\u2019s great to see a native DEX on Optimism with a team that contributes significantly to project onboarding. As many delegates such as @polynya @jackanorak have previously mentioned, it is really important that we finally have some serious evaluation of the first rounds of grants before doubling down on top initiatives. Despite that, we can only restate, that it would be very important for Optimism to have an ecosystem-wide liquidity, DeFi, NFT plan to incentivize the right partners or at least run short-term experiments that help Optimism come up with a competitive ecosystem strategy. As mentioned above, we should very deeply look at incentivizing what\u2019s best for the ecosystem (lowering entry barriers, improving efficiency & liquidity), and not waste incentives on conflicting incentive programs or pick pre-maturely favorites & lock-ins. In that regard, thank you for the data provided. That helps already significantly in reviewing your new grant request. We believe a 2nd grant to Velo could be well-reasoned to further grow the Optimism ecosystem - esp. in regards to project onboarding & kickstarting liquidity for new projects on Optimism. Looking forward especially to your takes re: key ecosystem pairs & competiting incentive campaigns! And, we\u2019d love to hear the evaluation from the Foundation too as mentioned in the beginning.

Based on what I understood, the percentages provided under \u201cNumber of OP Tokens Requested: 4,000,000 OP\u201d have been calculated by dividing the metrics by the total number of OP tokens other protocols have received. While this is more fair than comparing Velodrome metrics to pre-grant metrics of other projects (which I mistakenly understood before), then I would still be wary of using these metrics for justifying the size of the new grant since it\u2019s based on total number of tokens received and does not actually account for how much of the grants have been used till now. This means Velodrome has inherently higher statistics compared to projects that have not used their OP grant yet or are using it up in a slower pace. I understand Velodrome has put great effort into working with other protocols. In this proposal the grant would be also used for supporting other projects by \u201cLowering Barriers to Entry with Locking Incentives\u201d and \u201cBoosting Ecosystem Efficiency with Bribe Matching\u201d. But doesn\u2019t that somewhat force other projects to work with Velodrome to maximize their funds and thus create unfair conditions for Velodromes competitors?

But, regardless the plan was always to pursue grants through governance.     ScaleWeb3:  Why is it that larger trades are routed more through Uni v3?   First, we should note that most pairs actually don\u2019t trade through Uniswap at all. As @OPGovWatch pointed out above, Velodrome supports liquidity for 29 separate projects to Uniswaps 9. For most of the ecosystem, no trades route through UniV3 at all because it has no significant liquidity for their pairs. Second, concentrated liquidity will certainly be more optimal for key pairs and it will always be an important portion of the ecosystem DEX landscape. That is why we\u2019re exploring adding it to Velodrome. But, concentrated liquidity is not without it\u2019s own issues. It is inaccessible to the retail LPs and there is plenty of research to suggest huge % of LPs lose money on Univ3. It is not as capable as Velodrome is at providing fast, accessible liquidity/onboarding and it cannot be relied on alone to power an ecosystem.     ScaleWeb3:  Uniswap has been more important for key ecosystem pairs so far without incentives. (Check routing from 1inch for USDC/ETH/WBTC, Op pair somewhat split between Velo & Uni v3)   Looking at snapshots of routing will never give you an accurate picture of routing in the aggregate. I\u2019d recommend pulling comparative volume numbers for specific pairs over 30 to 90 day periods for that kind of analysis. That said, you are correct that the vast majority of UniV3s volume on Optimism is through just a few key pairs (also Perps variable pairs inflate volume numbers as well and need to be controlled for). It is not accurate however to say that they are not incentivized. Projects are incentivizing heavily on UniV3. Just less efficiently.     ScaleWeb3:  As mentioned by @GFXlabs @katie, the Ask is very large - especially given in a lump sum.   It only looks very large if you look at it without applying any comparative analysis to other grants that have gone out (as high as 9M OP) relative to size and performance of the grantee protocols. That is why we took care to lay this out above. Indeed, it is actual significantly less in $ value terms that the original grant given to us by OP Labs. You have to also take into consideration that the matching investment of incentives ($6m+) from Velodrome here is unprecedented and we\u2019re the only project that has partner add their own matches on top of that to access the incentives, increasing the multiplier effect It is critical for the effectiveness of these programs that Governance evaluate large asks in their broader context. I would ask that if we continue to call the ask \u201clarge\u201d we get specific in relative to what.     ScaleWeb3:  Requiring projects to invest into Velo instead of Op is not optimal in our opinion. We would look at this more postive if projects were to lock Op or an 80/20 position that helps with effective liquidity (\u00b1)   I\u2019m not sure I follow here. When projects lock VELO they gain the ability to direct emissions to build liquidity and their share of the 100% of protocol that is directed to lockers. The token has both functional and financial utility to the protocols, allowing them to create revenue positive liquidity programs. The procuring and locking of it also supports a virtuous cycle that benefits the ecosystem at large. It is what has helped to drop ecosystem liquidity costs by 30%-70%. Why isn\u2019t this a behavior we\u2019d want to incentivize? OP tokens at this time only utility is governance. I\u2019m not sure why Velodrome would be the best place to force the locking of $OP tokens. This seems like something better undertaken by governance. For example, perhaps in the future locking/staking it required for voting. That said, we do care a lot about bringing more utility to the OP token. That is part of why the Optimism Foundation received the largest partner veNFT to support their ability to vote for incentives (in perpetuity) for OP pairs. It is why we\u2019ve raised possible solutions like increasing the number of OP token pairs and making it possible to delegate your OP while in LPs.     ScaleWeb3:  You mention competiting incentives: Do you mean within or outside of Optimism?   Yes, competing incentives coming from other chains such as Arbitrum, Metis, etc. [quote=\u201cScaleWeb3, post:49, topic:3736\u201d] What kind of impact do you expect from full deployments of Curve and the upcoming start of incentives on Uniswap, Curve, Sushi + Velodrome on Velo bribing, efficiency, market share? [/quote] As I understand things, Curve has no plans for a full deployment on Optimism. Staking will remain on mainnet, governance will remain on mainnet, and fees will continue to be sent to mainnet indefinitely. It sounds as if native bribing may eventually come, but there are no immediate plans outside of the stopgap solution they\u2019ve presented for the purposes of receiving a grant. As for incentives on those other platforms, our hope would be that the combined power of them helps to attract more liquidity and volume from mainnet and alt L1s, growing the total amount of TVL, volume, and economic activity on Optimism as a whole. The goal for all of us needs to be to reach that tipping point where Optimism can compete for the largest trades and liquidity providers, which creates a flywheel effect attracting even more activity to the network.     ScaleWeb3:  You state that liquidity cost from bribing is cheaper than direct incentives. Do you compare the same incentives on uni v2 or uni v3 as uni v3 might make up for the \u201cextra cost of direct incentives\u201d?   Bribe for emissions models such as Curve and Velodrome have been demonstrated to be more efficient than direct incentives on UniV2 or UniV3. We have plenty of direct 1:1 examples comparing incentives on UniV3 vs Velodrome as @tao outlined above. It is why there are 20+ protocols incentivizing on Velodrome and like 3 on Uniswap. It is also why projects like Aelin shifted all of their incentives to Velodrome from Uniswap saving millions in the process.     ScaleWeb3:  Do you believe it makes sense to incentivize the same pairs on different DEXs?   Yes, it certainly could make sense to push every DEX to co-incentivize key ecosystem public good pairs as part their proposals. I actually advocated for this on Curve\u2019s proposal, but it didn\u2019t seem like there was any appetite for it there.     ScaleWeb3:  Despite \u201cslow\u201d market share growth of DEX aggregators on l2s, we strongly believe in abstraction over time & that users move towards wallets with built-in meta-aggregators in low-cost environments. Hence, we\u2019d recommend a focus on protocol efficiency metrics (Slippage, trades (volume) routed, effective liquidity) over adoption KPIs (TVL, direct users, transactions).   We stand up great on these metrics too, more data coming.     ScaleWeb3:  Probably this doesn\u2019t need to be stated. 4 Mio Op (110K OP per week!) is definitely a huge Ask. We appreciate the depth of the proposal and data provided, some of the \u201ccomparable metrics\u201d are flawed though (apples & oranges) and should at most be used as small indicator in a comprehensive review.   Good ser. Out of respect for us and the 20+ protocols who have co-signed the proposal, can you please demonstrate the flaw or suggest a better framework before implying ours is flawed in some way. As stated above, the ask is not huge relative to objective measures or the matching investment. Additionally, no other proposal has ever been paired as simply with a proven 2x-3x return on the grant value or a promise to match 1.6x the underlying value in incentives. It would behoove us not to think of it in terms of this will cost $3.8m. But rather, it will return at least $7.6m to $11.4m in value based on the demonstrated performance of the original grant. I have a feeling that if governance doesn\u2019t show a capacity to process large deeply evidenced grant requests at a similar level to OP Labs that the power to allocate them may be shifted away.

Each has largely been given what they have asked for to incentivize users and now have a chance to demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs they designed. Your suggestion that anyone is being \u201cforced\u201d to do anything makes me think you\u2019re not engaging in good faith here. If they can drive similar growth, I expect them to do exactly what we\u2019re doing. Come back with results and ask for additional to support it. But mostly, this is the absolute wrong way to think about DEXs on Optimism. The goal of grants is to grow the entire ecosystem. DEXs on Optimism are less in competition with one another than we are collectively in a competition to attract liquidity from other layers and chains (although some are less incentivized to focus on attracting it away from their own platforms on other networks) . Deeper liquidity across all of us will drive more volume across of us and drive economic growth across the network. Turning it into a zero-sum marketshare on the network is absolutely missing the forrest for the trees and misunderstands the entire purpose of the grants. ",

I\u2019ve been a long time user of Optimism and I use it frequently since I do a lot of arbitrage and other trading strategies on here. From my own experience Optimism was never that interesting because liquidity was very limited on the main DEX at that time (uniswap). When Velodrome was added and especially when the OP grant was liquidity boomed and there were a lot more projects with deep liquidity on Optimism. When I look at all the grants that have been given by OP in my opinion Velodrome must have been one of the most succesful, onboarding new users and creating more possibilities for the user on the network. In my mind this grant to Velodrome would be an easy yes and I will certainly vote for the proposal. Keep it up and keep making it easy for protocols to come to Optimism and provide liquidity. ",

To me, the less said the better and many people smarter than I am perfectly argued the details of that proposal for a successful outcome. That being said, I feel compelled to point out this statement from Alex because I feel the Velodrome ROI is in a class of it\u2019s own and I want voters to understand what\u2019s at stake. I get the hesitance towards a relatively new bribing system that brands itself as a \u201cpublic good\u201d. However, the system is working and it\u2019s currently providing multiple protocols the opportunity to have deep liquidity for a fraction of the cost elsewhere. An approved grant to velodrome is like granting the entire ecosystem imo\u2026 which is what we are set out to do. Is the flywheel sustainable? Idk. But the potential reward (with data to back projections) certainly seems worth the risk.

They seem to be continuously engaged with protocols not yet on Optimism, and are the only grant recipient I know of that have taken on the voluntary burden of being an unofficial ambassador for the ecosystem. I think this deserves recognition. Several of these protocols who moved to Optimism are posting in this thread in support of the proposal. While this thread has clearly not avoided standard online forum shenanigans, I urge any voters to not miss the forest for the trees. At the current time Velodrome is the very definition of critical infrastructure to Optimism, and the way the $OP incentives flow, both from the prior grant and as proposed, support the whole ecosystem of participants. I am in agreement with @ramblers99\u2019s comments. I believe the ask amount is appropriate and I like the two-phase compromise. ",

                    "content": "    Butterbum:  I would like to see Velodrome survive without incentives.   Why? Velodrome would survive just fine without incentives. It is the rate of ecosystem growth that would suffer. The cost of liquidity incentives would increase, putting strain on ecosystem treasuries. Projects would need to increase the rate at which they are spending their granted OP to close the gap, depleting governance funds faster and increasing OP sell pressure. And it\u2019d make it harder for new projects to bootstrap and onboard, slowing the growth in economic activity and losing builders to other networks. It would also put Governance in an awkward position where it is directing millions in incentives to multi-chain DEXs worth billions of dollars that are offering somewhere between $0 to a few hundred thousand in co-incentives, while passing on their only homegrown public good DEX\u2019s offer to pump another $6.5mm in stimulus into the ecosystem. According to the data shared by the Foundation on the Governance Grants to date, Velodrome actually attracted more TVL growth ($66mm) than all the governance grants combined ($60mm). Velodrome did this with a grant of 3mm in OP compared to the 40mm OP distributed by governance. You are essentially suggesting ending the most successful ecosystem growth program funded to date.     Butterbum:  My understanding is, the 1.5 Million allocation is for locked up velo. Which seems like the incentive is designed for buy pressure on your token \u2018velo\u2019.   You are referring to the \u201clock bonus\u201d here. The purpose of it is made explicit in the proposal, namely to lower barriers of entry for protocols seeking to invest and build in the Optimism ecosystem. From the proposal:  To onboard new protocols to the Optimism ecosystem during uncertain times and in the face of competing incentives, we must ensure that they are able to bootstrap their liquidity in the most cost-effective method possible. At the same time, these incentives should be paired with mechanisms that require protocols to meaningfully invest in the ecosystem for the long term and thus discourage mercenary and exploitative behaviors.   Incentivizing the acquisition and locking of veVELO is an ideal strategy in this regard, as it requires a multi-year lock of capital in the ecosystem to receive the lock bonus and access Velodrome\u2019s voting and revenue generation capabilities. It is to our knowledge the only currently running incentive program that requires the locking of capital in the Optimism ecosystem. Incentivizing locking lowers the underlying costs of building an initial veVELO position (by an average of ~25% ) while simultaneously giving any protocol the power to direct emissions and attract liquidity for the long term.  Whereas other incentives programs, particularly proposed by DEXs, focus on direct rewards to liquidity providers who have demonstrated a willingness to quickly exit ecosystems when they taper, this locking incentive requires protocols to lock their investment into ecosystem for four years to access the bonus. Indeed, it has already helped lead to $11.2mm (70% of all supply) being locked in the ecosystem for an average of 3.6 years, a feat we have not seen repeated by any other ecosystem incentive program and that isn\u2019t currently possible for protocols like Curve who require you stake on mainnet. These locked positions further increase the capital efficiency of their incentive programs, reduce the need for protocols to rely on external incentives (such as OP) long term, and actually drive revenue back to them (at a pace of over $10M a year returned to lockers atm).   twitter.com    Velodrome (\ud83d\udeb4,\ud83d\udeb4) @VelodromeFi  Assuming the lock bonus and bribe boosts last for 12 weeks and all recouped funds are compounded into more veVELO, at week 6 the protocol has spent less treasury assets overall than if they were only bribing each week. https://t.co/k4TdVz00W4   1:49 PM - 8 Oct 2022           13                3            If there are indeed second order positive effects on token price, it only would only serve to accelerate a flywheel designed to support the ecosystem: further lowering costs, deepening liquidity, increasing volume, attracting users, delivering more revenue to protocols. In short, the more protocols locking value into the ecosystem the better off the ecosystem will be. ",

If you are implying that the OP locking incentives are used to pump the token price, then you can look at the price history of the token thus far. The price of the VELO token has been in the same range since August despite ongoing locking incentives. There was an initial run up after the June market wide collapse once protocols had begun onboarding onto Optimism, which coincided with the initial OP bribe incentives. At this time VELO/USDC liquidity was a mere $500,000. This July run up also coincided with a 70% ETH run off the June lows. This is besides the point however, a second read of the wall of text in the initial proposal may be in order to refresh your understanding of the reasoning behind locking incentives. ",

Butterbum:  Obviously going to have a direct impact on the price of your token.   I actually do not believe it is obvious that it will have any kind of significant impact, but would welcome any analysis indicating otherwise. Incentives have actually remained consistent since July 15th or so and we\u2019ve seen massive price movements both up and down. Indeed, we actually announced that we were decreasing the lock incentive on 10/19 and have seen the token go up by 15% since. Again, the primary purpose and impact of the incentive is reduce the costs to protocols looking to build long term revenue positive liquidity programs on Optimism and the 20+ net new protocols we\u2019ve onboarded (even as price has gone up and down), the increasing number of protocol accumulators, and $11mm+ we\u2019ve locked in the ecosystem should be evidence that it is working as intended.  image2232\u00d71177 139 KB      Butterbum:  This is my point we can\u2019t be expected to \" pump another $Xmm in stimulus into the ecosystem\" every time the incentives dry up It\u2019s just not sustainable\u2026   I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve understood our proposal. We are the ones pumping 6.5mm in stimulus into the ecosystem. This not only represents over 1.6x the grant request size but also equals over half of all $OP incentives projected to be distributed via governance over the same period. The ecosystem needs to grow before it can become self-sustaining. Limiting stimulus in its prime growth phase or over-investing in inefficient incentives is recipe for ecosystem stagnation (especially when competitors come with their own programs). Once sufficient economic activity exists on the network (which we\u2019re actively onboarding), organic revenue and retroactive public good funding will be more than enough to sustain it.

You\u2019ll see that Velodrome on average between our two proposals is offering 1.7x its grant request in co-incentives and is supporting 3.2x the number of projects as the others combined. For the most part, the other projects have offered zero in co-incentives, with the few that have representing an estimated $400,000 or so (difficult to estimate precisely). That means Velodrome is offering 31x the co-incentives as the other 7 projects combined while only asking for 1.6x the grant size. Most of the other proposals are a mix between haven\u2019t started yet, still waiting on approval, or currently in a progress so as of the moment there is no way to measure if they are achieving a similar 2x-3x ROI on their underlying grant value, though we\u2019d suspect that is unlikely due to most of them using direct incentives (a 1:1 return) and lack of meaningful co-incentives. However if they do, we\u2019d expect them to do exactly what we are doing upon the conclusion of their programs: come back with results and ask for support in continuing the programs if there is still an ecosystem growth case to be made. We\u2019d reiterate that we do not think of incentivizing DEXs as some sort of zero-sum game where investing in one harms the others. The goal of governance is to maximize growth and it absolutely should invest more heavily where co-investment is higher and results are proven.

For example: \u201cVelodrome would be better off directing OP incentives to XXX, as it would drive higher transaction volume / user growth / user retention. Here\u2019s my data to demonstrate why\u201d Here are 5 themes we\u2019ve identified so far:  1) Part of the data provided is based on a snapshot (e.g., 24hr Volume) and may not be representative of recent performance   We have now included 30-day Avg Volume and 30-day Avg TVL. There are slight differences in the figures but the overall results are directionally unchanged:  Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 16.27.451920\u00d7614 84.4 KB    Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 16.52.411226\u00d7548 115 KB     2) Velodrome attracts lower Volume per TVL than alternative DEXes   When comparing same asset pairs (e.g., OP/USDC, ETH/USDC), Velodrome\u2019s Volume per TVL is similar to that of both Uniswap and Curve (see charts below). We believe Uniswap and Curve are perhaps the top 2 DEXes in all crypto. Performing on par with them is a testament in itself. We acknowledge UniV3 pools can offer very low slippage for large trades. Although Velodrome remains competitive for the majority of trades using pools with similar liquidity depth, we like the concentrated liquidity architecture and plan on implementing a similar model for our pools. Some Velodrome pools attract lower volume, as they serve different types of protocols. We welcome these pools, as supporting a wide variety of assets is part of our value proposition.  Volume/TVL for pools with >$100K TVL on Uniswap and Velodrome  Screen Shot 2022-10-27 at 14.05.161604\u00d7910 185 KB  Volume/TVL and Volume/$1 incentives for sETH and sUSD pools on Curve and Velodrome  Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 16.27.561920\u00d7580 84.1 KB   3) Grant ask is too large   As a share of the Optimism ecosystem, Velodrome represents 10% of TVL, 12% of transaction volume, 16% of transactions, and 13% of users, while requesting 1.72% of the Governance Fund.   Using these metrics, the Governance Fund could distribute a similar ratio of OP tokens to ALL existing protocols and still keep 82%- 89% of funds to be used for other grants:  Screen Shot 2022-10-27 at 16.00.571808\u00d7344 117 KB    Even including Velodrome\u2019s grant from OP Labs, the ratio of impact per grant size is extremely favorable  Screen Shot 2022-10-27 at 16.01.031808\u00d7344 126 KB     4) What is Velodrome providing to the ecosystem / what about protocol revenue?  For Liquidity Providers on Optimism, Velodrome has distributed over $7M in VELO emissions, continuing at a pace of ~$300K per week  Yes OPUser, the emissions are part of the protocol. You can see details at https://velodrome-docs.pages.dev/tokenomics    For veVELO holders, Velodrome has delivered ~$450K in fees from >$2B in volume and ~$1M in bribes from partner protocols (net of Velodrome\u2019s OP incentive program)   5) Velodrome has hit escape velocity / Velodrome should prove itself without incentives  Velodrome\u2019s success is strongly correlated to the success of Optimism. We cannot consider the protocol to have \u201chit escape velocity\u201d until Optimism itself is fully cemented as the go-to chain for the next generation of DeFi users. We believe eliminating incentives now will have predictable results (lower TVL, lower overall activity), and would hamper our ability as a protocol to compete with other L2s / alt-L1s planning to deploy incentives in their own ecosystems. Attracting liquidity and users back to an ecosystem is significantly more expensive than maintaining them, since incentives (e.g., APRs) must be attractive enough to drive actions such as bridging capital and LPing. Despite the attractive returns on Velodrome, we still notice a lack of confidence from DeFi players to participate in Velodrome\u2019s model. For example, veVELO voters have received >200% APRs in bribes and fees consistently for the past 4-5 weeks, 3-5x higher than other ve token protocols such as Curve, pointing to lower willingness to lock VELO. This grant would allow Velodrome to continue building confidence from interested players, while we focus on further developing the platform and onboarding new partners. The grant will effectively run longer than the time period Velodrome has been live to date. As outlined above, we\u2019re happy to structure the grant in stages to measure ongoing results.  We greatly appreciate your support. ",

As you can see, the lock bonus rate has remained constant for months while the price of the token has had movements up as high as 300% and down as low as 85%. You can also see in the chart where the lock bonus was decreased by 20% and price rose 15%. The opposite effect you would expect if what you were claiming was true.  Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 7.42.30 AM1920\u00d71012 40.3 KB  So I\u2019ll reiterate that there is no obvious significant correlation between the bonus and price. There are too many other variables that drive price more significantly. You can also see this in the fact that other ecosystem tokens pumped at the exact same time.  image1325\u00d7935 66.6 KB   image1322\u00d7647 52.9 KB  Where there is a more clear relationship is in the weekly lock rate, which increased upon the start of the incentives and has maintained a steady rate, mostly exceeding weekly emissions. Exactly what we\u2019d expect a bonus focused on reducing barriers to locking (not price pumping) to do.  Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 7.57.25 AM1464\u00d7682 40.5 KB  Finally, I will just note again that even if there were a clear positive correlation with price, that still wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing as it would only lead to better outcomes for the ecosystem. If VELO were to 3x tomorrow, liquidity for the 30+ ecosystem projects we support would triple as well. There is no other token on the network that can have this kind of outsized impact. But to reiterate, that is not really what is important. What is important is relative value of locking vs bribing and the overall health of our liquidity economy as we\u2019ve documented in our proposal.     Butterbum:  My fear would be, that Velodrome will continuously demand incentive plans from the Fund to keep it going. I just want to avoid the risk, of the Fund being forced to perpetually support a protocol to avoid a scenario.   This is just not how investing to grow/scale works. Perhaps an analogy would help. Think of Optimism as new city that is trying to attract citizens and businesses to it. One day in that future, it will have a broad enough base of them that the economic activity they generate will sufficient to not only drive sustainable revenue t businesses but also it\u2019s taxes (sequencer revenue) will be sufficient to support and maintain the City of Optimism\u2019s essential infrastructure (public goods). But, we are not not there yet. We need to grow substantially more before the city\u2019s economy is self-sustaining. That is why the grant programs exist. That is where Velodrome comes in. It is part of the city\u2019s essential infrastructure. You can think of it as the roads and highways that people use to get to the City of Optimism and that businesses use to move their goods throughout it. It charges the lowest possible fees for its use and returns 100% the value it generates back to the public, while simultaneously reducing liquidity costs ecosystem wide. Why is this important? Because investing in infrastructure is one of the best ways to drive economic growth. It creates one of the best multiplier effects (2x-3x in our case) on the underlying investment and drives growth in economic activity across the network. As @ramblers99 put it, a \u201cgrant to velodrome is like granting the entire ecosystem\u201d, but getting 2x-3x the results of direct grants. As long as growth remains the focus of governance and we can demonstrate that we are one of the single best means of facilitating it, we will request grant funds (as anyone in a similar position should). But there will be a day where the city has attracted enough economic activity that investing heavily in growth will no longer be needed. That is when Optimism can pull back on economic stimulus and let public goods self-sustain through the taxes and fees they collect. Pulling back too early will only serve to slow or reverse the hard earned growth we\u2019ve achieved so far, long before the city is in a position to sustain itself. (btw you could write a similar analogy for how startups scale here) ",

Yes, the data I shared above would suggest you are indeed mistaken. But, here let\u2019s take a look at it again with your frame.     Ardordo:  08/7 \u2013 it was announced that Velodrome received the grant, start of the price increase 13/7 to 27/7 \u2013 heavy campaign of the OP airdrop 29/7 \u2013 hype from the campaign ended, followed by heavy price decrease    Screenshot 2022-10-28 at 4.29.01 PM1502\u00d7884 133 KB  Seems vaguely plausible right? The problem is that is the SNX chart, not VELO. And if you look at Thales, Lyra, or almost any ecosystem token you\u2019ll see they follow almost the same trajectory. Suggesting the significant factors driving the price changes cannot reasonably be attributed to the  ongoing lock bonus. The frame is also false because you are misrepresenting the nature of our communications around it, which have been as steady as the bonus itself. If you\u2019d done us the kindness of checking your assertions before dropping them here, you would\u2019ve seen us talking about it every week since it began.     Ardordo:  Not sure how it\u2019s fair to conclude that lock bonuses do not affect the price   It is fair because no one has provided a single data point to suggest there was any correlation between the lock bonus and Velodrome price. You cannot on one hand suggest it was a significant factor causing a 300% pump and while suggesting it\u2019s claimed pumping ability was powerless against an 85% decline, especially when those same patterns were playing out on every single ecosystem token. We also have over a week of data after decreasing the bonus showing the exact opposite of your claimed effect, the lock bonus has gone down and the price has gone up.     Ardordo:  I have mostly just lurked around the OP governance, but wanted to comment/ask additional information about this proposal and thus I am a new user here.

And if you look at Thales, Lyra, or almost any ecosystem token you\u2019ll see they follow almost the same trajectory. Suggesting the significant factors driving the price changes cannot reasonably be attributed to the ongoing lock bonus.   I was not expressing how the price was affected by the on-going lock bonus, I was expressing how the price was affected by the OP airdrop campaign for the VELO lockers, which I would also describe as a bonus for lockers.     [Album] imgur.com      These are the SNX and VELO charts together, everyone is free to come to their own conclusions, but my personal take-away is that announcement of the OP grant and OP airdrop campaign definitely had a noticeable affect on the VELO price. I think it\u2019s also fairly obvious from the fact that at some point for every $1 in VELO locked there would have been $1.3 OP airdropped as rewards. https://twitter.com/VelodromeFi/status/1548651423201730561     alexcutlerdoteth:  While the idea that you created an account last week to exclusively to comment on our proposal is certainly flattering, I do not get the sense that you are here in good faith. Now that you\u2019ve made your voice heard on Velodrome, perhaps you can reallocate your time to any of the other 8+ proposals currently up for review and in need of feedback?   I have both expressed in this thread that:  This grant proposal was the main reason why I felt the need to make an account and comment, since even though there was a lot of data provided, I didn\u2019t feel it was completely fair (one could see my previous comments for the percentages provided). I am somewhat biased, since I have prior concerns about Velodrome not being sustainable in the long-term without OP incentives.  If this discredits everything I have commented here and reflects that I am not here in good faith, then it is what it is. There is no denying that Velodrome\u2019s team is great at marketing and making noise, which has definitely ended up with more people learning about Optimism and joining the ecosystem, but I believe the technology of Velodrome\u2019s AMM is not that innovative and I am not sure how competitive it is in the long-term compared to the more sophisticated approaches of the competitors. I also believe that Velodrome price was heavily pumped up with the first grant and the current proposal does not reflect how substantial that effect was. Velodrome will continue growing/scaling while it is heavily reinforced with largest OP grants any project has received, but I am wary of what happens when the incentives stop and truthfully uncertain if best would be to experience it now or keep pushing it to the future with new continous grants.

                    "content": "Hello here; glad to see a healthy discussion happening! I wanted to give some perspective on what those OP lock bonuses achieve from the point of view of a project involved in the Velodrome races. I am TokenBrice, DeFi Strategist at Liquity, leading the charge on topics related to LUSD/LQTY liquidity strategies and integrations of LUSD within DeFi. We are currently leading various campaigns to sustain liquidity, whether on Curve, through Warden Bribes, or on Velodrome. In terms of the amount of liquidity sustained / $-invested, Velodrome is one to two orders of magnitude above the competition. Thanks to an initial 3.4M veVELO position (protocol airdrop), compounded weekly to now ~4.5M veVELO, Liquity can sustain about ~$6.3M on four different pools (LUSD/sUSD, LUSD/USDC, LUSD/MAI, LUSD/USD+). Adding the OP lock bonus drove us to adjust our strategy, increasing the weekly locks to enhance our gauge supporting power while maximizing the reward. To put some numbers in perspective:   4.5M veVELO (~$120K) locked enable to support ~$6M of stablecoin liquidity on Velodrome. (+some bribes from projects we work with that are re-injected as bribes again the following round) To direct 1% of CRV emissions, you\u2019d need to bribe either ~25K a week or a ~5M veCRV position costing ~$4.8M. 1% of CRV-gauge votes is enough to draw a ~3% base APY to a $25M TVL pool. Translating back above into similar terms, it means that to sustain a >3% base APY on a 6M TVL stable Curve Pool you\u2019d need roughly either 6.2K weekly bribes (0.25% total gauge voting) or 1.25M veCRV ($1.2M)   I think those napkin maths illustrate what I meant by \u201cone or two orders of magnitude above\u201d when it comes to Velodrome\u2019s efficiency for a project. Of course, there are other things to consider, and the comparison should be based on various dimensions. However, one of Velodrome\u2019s core value propositions is enabling projects to attract and sustain liquidity efficiently. In that regard, it is delivering beyond what was expected: the OP veVELO locking bonus is a key part of the equation - increasing the efficiency of the flywheel even further. Besides, it drives projects to lock VELO, which means they enter a long-term commitment with Velodrome and Optimism. Hope this helps fuel the discussion, I am available if there are more questions about the impact of the OP-bonuses on the strategies projects involved in the races harness. ",

Only an extension of the ongoing lock bonus (at a lower rate). So it sounds like we agree that on an ongoing basis the significant factors driving the price changes cannot reasonably be attributed to a ongoing lock bonus such as the one contained within this proposal.      Ardordo:  I think it\u2019s also fairly obvious from the fact that at some point for every $1 in VELO locked there would have been $1.3 OP airdropped as rewards.   You could say this every single week as the the \u201celigible lockers\u201d resets to 0 so the ratio of OP:VELO looks artificially high which is offset by a fairly predictable and consistent locking rate. This feels like you intentionally trying to misrepresent things.     Ardordo:  I am somewhat biased   What is driving your biases? You\u2019ve shared nothing about your background or experiences. It seems something in them has rendered Velodrome as the only topic of interest in Optimism governance. Perhaps you could share more about yourself so we could understand how your biases are shaping your perspective here? Which projects have you contributed to / are contributing to? We already have an sense of it, but might be good for you to share.     Ardordo:  I believe the technology of Velodrome\u2019s AMM is not that innovative and I am not sure how competitive it is in the long-term compared to the more sophisticated approaches of the competitors   Given how exhaustively we\u2019ve documented our product performing incredibly well against both Curve, Uniswap, and Beethoven perhaps you could offer evidence to support this rather than stating it as fact?     Ardordo:  Velodrome will continue growing/scaling while it is heavily reinforced with largest OP grants any project has received   This is not even remotely true. Why do you keep misrepresenting things? Multiple 9M OP grants have gone out to top projects Optimism, significantly larger than both of our requested grants combined. None of the grants to date have demonstrated the same kind of 2x-3x impact as our grant. According to Optimism\u2019s own numbers our 3M OP grant brought more TVL than every grant distributed by governance to date combined.     Ardordo:  This grant proposal was the main reason why I felt the need to make an account and comment, since even though there was a lot of data provided, I didn\u2019t feel it was completely fair   Look, I continue to believe you should show some interest in other proposals if you mean for us to take your objections to ours as serious and principled. But, if you are going to continue exclusively here, I beg you to back up your thesis\u2019s with data and evidence so we can have a constructive conversation. This team put literally weeks of work into all the research underpinning the that Velodrome has (perhaps) delivered the best ROI of any grant to date. This proposal may be the single most deeply researched and sourced one to be submitted to governance yet. It represents not just our voice, but the voices of is over 20 ecosystem builders/partners who signed on to support it. Perhaps you do indeed know better than people like @TokenBrice, but trying to undercut our collective perspectives with specious arguments and misrepresentations does them and us a substantial disservice.

We\u2019ve had an extraordinary 26 total non-Velodrome commenters on our proposal so far.

Positive: 12 (52%) Mixed: 6 (26%) Negative: 5 (21%)  That said, sentiment varies significantly depending on account type: New Anon Accounts (6 total) \u2013 3 positive (25% of all positive) \u2013 0 mixed (0% of all mixed) \u2013 3 negative (60% of all negative) Old Anon Accounts (6 total) \u2013 3 positive (25% of all positive) \u2013 2 mixed (33% of all mixed) \u2013 1 negative (16% of all negative) Delegate Accounts (5 total) \u2013 0 positive (0% of positive) \u2013 4 mixed (71% of all mixed) \u2013 1 negative (20% of all negative) Builder Accounts (6 total) \u2013 6 positive (50% of positive) \u2013 0 mixed (0% of all mixed) \u2013 0 negative (0% of all negative) While it may be difficult to perceive to the sheer velocity of their posting, negative proposal sentiment to date has really just coming from about 5 accounts, of which 3 are new anon accounts created in the last two weeks. While that does not mean that their feedback should not be taken into consideration, we do hope it helpful to understand the nature of the overarching sentiment of the feedback to so far. We hope to see more feedback from delegate and builder accounts in the coming days to ensure that we can address their questions/concerns and make sure their voices are not being drowned out of this process.

Are you asking how we know how much in co-incentives Curve is likely to match for incentivized pools? If so, we really don\u2019t. Curve has not committed to any sort of targets that I know of (as we have) and the overwhelming majority Curve\u2019s emissions will continue to go to mainnet for the foreseeable future. It will take time before there is hard data on the effectiveness of using bribing veCRV voters with non-main net asset like $OP and we get a clear picture on their rate of their coincentivization. That said, Optimism\u2019s research into the effectiveness of incentive programs to date did document the current rate of CRV emissions flowing to Optimism, which is what we used for our projection.  To put this in perspective, that is $90,000 in co-incentives from Curve over a period where Velodrome distributed $2,900,000. That means we are pumping 32x the stimulus into the Optimism economy that Curve is while asking for a grant merely 8x the size of theirs.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  Some of us have emphasized here, Sustainable Growth. This does not include the increase in metrics for constant subsidy/issuance; but what will happen when both end? The incentives generate tvl and volume, but when the incentives end, the liquidity disappears   We\u2019ve addressed this ad naseum at this point, both in the proposal and in our responses. Please refer to those answers here, here, here, and here. If you want to dispute any particular arguments, please quote them and provide data or evidence to support your assertion.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  Do you think that if it hadn\u2019t received the first grant, Velodrome would hold metrics above other dexes today?   To be clear, Uniswap received their grant before us. I think the pace at which they\u2019ve moved to put it to use makes it clear how much of a priority Optimism currently is for them. As for if our metrics would be the same? It\u2019s impossible to know. Even before the grant, we had plenty of data indicating we were the most capital efficient DEX on Optimism and were beginning to attract new partners so it\u2019s possible we would still be in a strong position. However, it would\u2019ve made it far more expensive for the 15+ new protocols we\u2019ve onboarded who have not received grants from the governance to onboard their users, liquidity, and activity to Optimism. In other words, any loss of Velodrome\u2019s would\u2019ve also been a loss for the growth of the ecosystem and that would\u2019ve knock on effects that are difficulty to extrapolate.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  Yes, it will continue to maintain metrics above these; Well, then the new scholarship is not necessary, , since no dex has applied for a second grant. Not, if you think Velodrome wouldn\u2019t be the major Dex; (as I said in my first answer) we should wait to see how the Uni and Curve grants work out before continuing to subsidize Velodrome   I do not really understand your words here, but I will reiterate that every DEX that comes back to Optimism demonstrating a 2x-3x return on investment in terms of the growth multiple they\u2019ve provided should be strongly considered for an extension of their incentive programs. The only thing a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach will give you is slowing growth to the detriment of the ecosystem and a messy comparative data set on DEX incentives. ",

Curve\u2019s proposal requires the buying and locking of veCRV on mainnet to directly access the the $OP bribes they are requesting as incentives. The pools that get those incentives are also 100% controlled by the votes of veCRV stakers on mainnet, requiring staked veCRV to access. Likewise to earn the fees the boosted liquidity offers, you must again stake veCRV on mainnet. In other words, projects and individuals need to buy and lock veCRV to access their proposed incentives as well. I have not seen you raise a similar objection in their case. Is there a reason for this? In contrast every .20c in lock incentives spent earns the ecosystem $1 in TVL locked in Optimism for 4 years (a 5x return). As far as I know, it is the only program in existence that requires projects to lock investment into the ecosystem to access $OP rewards. You yourself have mentioned worrying about capital moving off of the network when incentives tapper, this solves for that at a 5x multiple.  image1156\u00d7704 30.3 KB  Do you have a suggestion for better a strategy?

The $OP reward of-course vary from epoch to epoch like mentioned above in comments.   This is tough for me to wrap my head around. I think you are trying to create a distinction where there really isn\u2019t one. Your objection was:     OPUser:  As a user if I need to buy project native token to be part of OP incentive, then I am not in favor of it.   Curve: You must acquire (or have acquired) and lock veCRV on Ethereum mainnet to access incentives designed to facilitate growth on Optimism. Velodrome: You must acquire and lock veVELO on Optimism to access the incentives designed to facilitate growth on Optimism. In both cases, you need to acquire \u201cthe project native token to be part of OP incentive\u201d, though as @GuyWithKeyboard just noted this is not limited to \u201cbuying\u201d as you suggest. If I am understanding your attempt at a distinction, for Curve you are saying you see no issue with requiring the acquisition of veCRV to access OP rewards, despite the fact that it leaks value and activity from Optimism to mainnet. But in the case of Velodrome, you don\u2019t think it is appropriate because it requires the acquisition of new tokens? So there is something intrinsically better about requiring the acquisition of a project native token when you you include both existing AND new veCRV lockers on mainnet rather than focusing the incentive just on new veVELO lockers on Optimism? Even when considering in our case the result is millions in new capital locked in the ecosystem, versus value leakage? This seems really hard to square fren, especially given when you\u2019ve supported other proposals that likewise \u201crequire the acquisition of project native tokens\u201d to access the incentives such as Balancer and Beethoven. And to be clear here, I think the Curve proposal is a perfectly acceptable given the technical limitations that exist at the moment to them supporting a fully native solution. It may be worth it to the ecosystem even if the incentive isn\u2019t quite as efficient. But, I\u2019m just struggling to find coherency in your suggestion that it\u2019s okay in the case of a solution that is objectively less optimal for Optimism and not okay in the case of an example that has demonstrated itself to be a ecosystem growth multiplier.

It seems like the main source of the criticisms is that the benefit for Optimism looks like this: Optimism should be looking to cultivate the presence of legacy mainnet protocols rather than supporting OP native upstarts with flashy marketing and distortive incentives. Supporting deep liquidity on known legacy protocols will be better for OP in the long run. Putting our thumb on the scale for Velodrome will prevent this needed development. I think this is a flawed argument based on the data provided and I don\u2019t see how any other current ecosystem player will step in to fill the niche Velodrome is filling in the near term. This isn\u2019t a knock on the legacy protocols. Onboarding a bunch of new protocols to Optimism makes no sense for them as a growth strategy. This shows up If you look at their grant proposals. They are looking to extend their current competitive advantage on mainnet to Optimism - not get into the business Velodrome is in. If Velodrome was proposing using the OP grant to spend a ton of money bribing a 3-pool, tricrypto or funding the development of v3 pools then sure\u2026 they are trying to box out the competition. However, they aren\u2019t trying to use the grant for this. They are asking to continue the incentives that have been filling a needed niche for OP\u2019s future growth. Protocols that have come here are backing up that these incentives, including the lock bonus, were the easiest way for them to come to Optimism. The mindset that we stop incentives and let Velodrome succeed or fail because we have so many well known protocols around to pick up the slack seems super short sighted. How will waiting to see what happens with the Uni/Curve incentive programs onboard 20 protocols to Optimism? Their incentive programs aren\u2019t even designed to do this. I\u2019m sure there will be competition between the different DEX/AMMs, but this grant doesn\u2019t seem to be playing a role in that. There are still a ton of needs to fill where legacy protocols have an obvious competitive advantage they will be able to exploit with some focused development. Velodrome making good use of incentives also goes both ways. Optimism governance benefits from having a DEX that they have significant influence (and voting power) over that can adapt on the fly to ecosystem needs.  The Velodrome team is willing to take on a ton of due diligence responsibilities to get the grant and they have basically created their own accountability metrics they will be measured by. Seems like an obvious win. ",

Case 1 :  Existing veToken holder  Curve - As a existing holder of veCRV, I will get reward depending on the amount I hold and how I vote. Velo - same as above  Case 2 :  New user  Curve - I can use 100K $USD to acquire more CRV, lock it to get more veCRV. My voting power increase resulting in more reward and my principle amount is locked in form new veCRV. Velo - Same as above, + I will get some % of my principle money back in form of $OP as mentioned in the proposal for buying and locking $VELO. We have seen that lock bonus vary  but could possibly reach up to $1.3 in $OP for $1 in    depending on amount locked in that specific epoch but even If I take an average of  80%  30% return then at the end of epoch I will back  $80K back  30K in form of $OP airdropped as a reward.  So basically, we are paying users to buy protocol native token which is not the case with Curve. Hope this example provide  more context from my side.     tao:  40K OP incentives per week over 6 months, distributed to veVELO lockers proportionally to new veVELO balance per week   I am not trying to create a distinction, its clearly mentioned in the proposal.     katie:  do not like to see edits made after approval has been given   Thank you for this, Katie.

Screenshot 2022-10-30 at 5.28.28 AM1536\u00d7604 81.9 KB  I think what you are advocating for here is objectively a bad deal for growing Optimism. You could have an incentive that lowers the costs for new protocols onboarding the ecosystem (locking $1 in capital for every 20c in incentives), but it seems that you think that ensuring that existing lockers are included is more important, even if that means rewarding $veCRV voters with no vested interest or investment in the ecosystem over actual Optimism users. I think we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. Do any other delegates have a POV here? ",

Their proposal is not airdropping OP directly to users wallet for locking BAL or Beets edit 3- dont want to spam the thread so will edit this comment as needed. I understand that, as a user I dont necessarily need to buy the token, acquiring via farming could be another way to get the token.

Oh, my apologies. You are talking about these chart.           These have nothing to do with the grant proposals. This is just an analysis of the relative effectiveness of when protocols incentivize liquidity on Curve or Uniswap with direct incentives versus when they incentivize on Velodrome with bribes. As you can see they get somewhere between 1.3x - 3.3x the ROI on Velodrome. This is because bribes for emissions models have been proven to be more capital efficient that direct liquidity incentives and Velodrome is the only platform with native bribing on Optimism.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  That\u2019s right, and that pumping was absorbed by the skaters, each one chooses how to mistreat their tokenomica   I don\u2019t think this statement translated well. Could you try to restate it?     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  your conclusion is that if Optimims doesn\u2019t inject 4M of $OP now ngmi? or is Velodrome who ngmi?   Velodrome would be fine. It is the rate of ecosystem growth that would suffer. The cost of liquidity incentives would increase, putting strain on ecosystem treasuries. Projects would need to increase the rate at which they are spending their granted OP to close the gap, depleting governance funds faster and increasing OP sell pressure. And it\u2019d make it harder for new projects to bootstrap and onboard, slowing the growth in economic activity and losing builders to other networks. The opposite of what governance is supposed to be doing. I think it is probably worth reemphasizing that we\u2019ve onboarded over 32 net new protocols and projects to the ecosystem at a pace of about 5 per-month.  Screenshot 2022-10-30 at 6.26.09 AM1338\u00d7622 77 KB  Those projects are bringing new users, capital, and activity to the network. We believe we need to continue to onboard new protocols at this pace and have proven methods for doing it. As @states_of_nature1651 so nicely put it (great post, ser), no legacy AMM is even suggesting that they\u2019re interested in taking that work on. But really, you don\u2019t need to trust us on this, just listen to the builders.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  For a protocol that seeks to boost its incentives, it is not comparable to do it with $velo or with $crv, the metrics here show a much greater loss of capital for $velo stakers.   Can you clarify this and provide some supporting data? Voters on Velodrome have earned more than voters on Curve for our entire existence.     Jadmat.Eth-DefiLatam:  Curve\u2019s proposal encourages the diversion of $crv rewards TOWARDS OPTIMISM, it is exactly the opposite of what you indicate, under your analogy it would be an \u201cimporting value from the main network\u201d   Yes, this is correct. Assuming Curve\u2019s proposal passes, governance will literally bribing main-net veCRV stakers to vote to direct CRV emissions to the Optimism network. It is yet to be seen what the ROI of this strategy will be. Velodrome on the other hand is offering $6.5M in emissions for incentivized pools, 1.6x the total value of the grant we are requesting and over half of all $OP incentives projected to be distributed via governance over the same period. Think about this, for a 4M OP grant we\u2019re basically going to give a 50% match on ALL the stimulus offered by Optimism Governance at large. We are committed keeping these emissions on Optimism in the context of this grant because we\u2019re ecosystem maxis who believe that it has a tremendous opportunity for growth. That does not mean that they must continue to go exclusively go to Optimism in the absence of such an agreement. There is just no way to cut the data to suggest that Optimism is getting anything other than an incredible ROI from granting Velodrome. ",

I want you to look at two things: the date of the tweet (July 17) and the deadline for locking (July 28) The point was at that moment (July 17) there had been little enough locked in the campaign that the next $1 VELO locked would have returned $1.3 of OP. That is, there was more OP earmarked for distribution relative to locked VELO to date. But as more VELO is locked over the next 11 days, that same OP gets spread out over more locked VELO so the final distribution per VELO would be much, much less. The tweet was just indicating that that hadn\u2019t really happened yet. In the end, enough had been locked that the bonus per $OP locked was a fraction of what you\u2019ve posted. So again, prob best to take it down - easy thing to misunderstand. ",

It may be one of the best ways to distribute Optimism Governance power to protocols and users who are most ecosystem aligned. There have been plenty of conversations about the best ways to ensure that protocols are able to gain a voice in governance. This may be one of the best ones as it essentially represents an exchange: you lock $1 in Optimism for four years, you get 20c worth of voting power in Optimism governance. This makes a ton of sense because projects and individuals locking for four years is demonstrating a long term commitment to ecosystem. They are now invested in both Velodrome and Optimism\u2019s success. They are exactly the kind of people who we want to have a say in governance. This seems far more likely to benefit the right kind of users that OP incentives that flow to fickle liquidity providers or mainnet stakers. There is also nothing in the language of this proposal that would prevent us from entering into a social contract with protocols who are earning these rewards to encourage them to hold and/or delegate the tokens they are earning.

I was referring to this section from the Beethoven/Balancer proposal indicating they\u2019d $OP would be used to directly bribe $veBAL voters (i.e. requiring the token to earn the reward).  Screenshot 2022-10-31 at 12.06.52 PM1432\u00d7360 43.4 KB  To be clear, I have no problem with as I understand how incentivizing them returns multiples versus on direct incentives. I was just trying to draw OPUser\u2019s attention to a lack of consistency in how he was evaluating proposals that require the veTOKENs to earn the OP rewards. It\u2019s possible they aren\u2019t actually bribing yet, but the point here is really just focused on what he is saying is okay to approve versus not. ",

The OP tokens from the grant are used as bribes when the bribe roi is positive and for direct LM when the bribes roi is negative, as you hinted, this is the most capital efficient method. Either way, the end result is the same no? which is LM incentives in the pools for OP participants of all kinds, utilizing various tokens, that provide liquidity in those pools. Also, either way, bribes or direct LM incentives, the grant tokens used are being matched 1:1 in value. Again, is this not truly benefitted at the user level, for people who join the pools, using any token they want for those various pools? therefore, to benefit from the use of the grant tokens, users simply need to provide liquidity in the pools. they are not required to attain project native tokens. Is that not the end result? would you agree with that analysis? Id like to further note that beetx on optimism has been using fees collected to market buy OP tokens to match with much (about 75% so far) of the grant tokens used for direct LM incentives.  Is this not further providing benefit to the OP eco and its users as its not simply matched with emissions only? Does that not also demonstrate a difference in the methodologies employed? Not trying to highjack your thread mate, and my apologies for doing so. Also not trying to be negative towards you or velo at all, and not saying either the velo or beetx methods are right or wrong. I simply wanted to explain the logic while i feel the comparison in bribing may not be so directly apt, and thus perhaps why OPuser had that opinion. ",

I think it totally appropriate for OP incentives to be directed to those who acquire (or have previously acquired) native project tokens as long as the second order effects of those incentives can be clearly demonstrated to drive multiples in growth back. As you describe, while the OP from bribes do indeed flow exclusively to those who have acquire (or have acquired) \u201cproject native tokens\u201d, they produce second and third order effects like increasing the cumulative rewards flowing to LPs within a given epoch and growing TVL on the network. Likewise while our OP lock bonuses flow exclusively exclusively to those acquiring \u201cproject native tokens\u201d, they produce second and third order through requiring protocols to lock 4x the investment in the ecosystem (increasing TVL) while giving them an ability to direct more emissions than the value of the underlying lock to LPs (in perpetuity). In one case, you\u2019re using incentives to rent the direction of LP emissions and in the other case you\u2019re using incentives to acquire the ability to direct emissions. In both cases, you need to own the project native token to access the first order incentive, but you do not need to hold the token to access the downstream benefits. ",

Overview Velodrome spent several weeks creating what is likely the detailed and evidenced proposal to be submitted to governance yet. If you have the time, please consider reading its in it\u2019s entirety. Since it\u2019s posting 12 days ago it has received 133 comments from 31 commentators:   Positive Commentators: 17 (58%)  Mixed Commentators: 5 (17%)  Negative Commentators: 7 (24%)  As you can see, there are more positive commentators than negative and mixed commentators combined. Though it may be hard to tell from differentials in the volume of post:  2.4x more commentators were positive than negative 100% of comments from builders were positive 43% of negative commentators were from new accounts Only 13% of positive comments were from new accounts   Notable Positive Comments Since there are have been far more positive comments than negative ones on the proposal, we\u2019ll start by highlighting a few positive ones that we think emphasize our impact well.  You can also check out the testimonials we\u2019ve collected from 10+ partners (and counting) on our Twitter.     Aes:  this is Aes from MakerDAO\u2019s Strategic Finance Core Unit. Wanted to post in support of this proposal and the Velo team - they\u2019ve been extremely patient, a pleasure to work with, and have been critical in analyzing how MakerDAO could best leverage the velo veNFT airdrop to maximize DAI\u2019s liquidity on Optimism.       bebis:  There\u2019s a lot of technical analysis going on here which I think distracts a bit from the value being added by the Velodrome team.  They\u2019re on-boarding a ton of people the hard way - with actual customer/client services. They\u2019re getting teams and users invested long-term in the ecosystem\u2019s success. They\u2019re the main Optimism point of contact if you\u2019re a builder/developer. Their bribing system makes operations much lighter for small teams and startups.  They\u2019re doing the hard, high-effort stuff that most aren\u2019t willing to. I\u2019d consider any proposal they put forth extremely seriously.       ramblers99:      alexcutlerdoteth:  It would behoove us not to think of it in terms of this will cost $3.8m. But rather, it will return at least $7.6m to $11.4m in value based on the demonstrated performance of the original grant.   I am not one for long winded governance debates and even knowingly sat out on the Overtime discussion even though I sit on the Thales Council \u2026 That being said, I feel compelled to point out this statement from Alex because I feel the Velodrome ROI is in a class of it\u2019s own and I want voters to understand what\u2019s at stake \u2026 the system is working and it\u2019s currently providing multiple protocols the opportunity to have deep liquidity for a fraction of the cost elsewhere. An approved grant to velodrome is like granting the entire ecosystem imo\u2026 which is what we are set out to do.       TokenBrice:  We are currently leading various campaigns to sustain liquidity, whether on Curve, through Warden Bribes, or on Velodrome. In terms of the amount of liquidity sustained / $-invested, Velodrome is one to two orders of magnitude above the competition. \u2026it is delivering beyond what was expected : the OP veVELO locking bonus is a key part of the equation - increasing the efficiency of the flywheel even further. Besides, it drives projects to lock VELO, which means they enter a long-term commitment with Velodrome and Optimism.       states_of_nature1651:  It seems like the main source of the criticisms is that the benefit for Optimism looks like this: Optimism should be looking to cultivate the presence of legacy mainnet protocols rather than supporting OP native upstarts with flashy marketing and distortive incentives. Supporting deep liquidity on known legacy protocols will be better for OP in the long run. Putting our thumb on the scale for Velodrome will prevent this needed development. I think this is a flawed argument based on the data provided and I don\u2019t see how any other current ecosystem player will step in to fill the niche Velodrome is filling in the near term. This isn\u2019t a knock on the legacy protocols. Onboarding a bunch of new protocols to Optimism makes no sense for them as a growth strategy. This shows up If you look at their grant proposals. They are looking to extend their current competitive advantage on mainnet to Optimism - not get into the business Velodrome is in.       jornx:  I\u2019ve been a long time user of Optimism and I use it frequently since I do a lot of arbitrage and other trading strategies on here\u2026Optimism was never that interesting because liquidity was very limited on the main DEX at that time (uniswap). When Velodrome was added and especially when the OP grant was liquidity boomed and there were a lot more projects with deep liquidity on Optimism.When I look at all the grants that have been given by OP in my opinion Velodrome must have been one of the most succesful, onboarding new users and creating more possibilities for the user on the network.    Key Discussion Points While negative and mixed commenters have represented a minority of the total engagement on the proposal, questions and concerns they\u2019ve raised have allowed us to discuss and clarify key points on our proposal. We provide a quick overview of some of the key questions raised and provide short  summaries of our responses:  Is Velodrome Asking for Too Large a Grant?  TLDR: No. It is 90%+ smaller than the average grant by every KPI, offers a proven 2x-3x ROI, and comes with Velodrome offering $6.5mm in co-incentives (31x those of other DEXs combined). Likewise, Velodrome represents 10% of TVL, 12% of transaction volume, 16% of transactions, and 13% of users, while requesting 1.72% of grant funds. No alternative frameworks for grant size evaluation have been suggested or offered.       Is The Lock Bonus An Appropriate Use of Funds?  TLDR: Yes. The incentive flows to veTOKEN lockers consistent with other proposals such as Curve/Balancer and while drive similar second order effects that grow the ecosystem by multiples and reduce costs for the ecosystem. No data has been provided suggesting it has any meaningful impact on price.       Would Builder Grants be Better?  TLDR: No. Velodrome grants have brought 30+ new builders  to the ecosystem by reducing their incentive costs by 20% - 70% while less accountable direct builder grants offered by other protocols have yet to demonstrate their efficacy.       Is Velodrome Really Competitive with Curve and Uniswap?  TLDR: Yes. Velodrome is more efficient in TVL/Volume / $ spent in incentives (lowering costs ecosystem wide). It also attracts similar levels of volume per dollar in TVL while simultaneously hosting 3.2x more ecosystem projects tokens than Uniswap and Curve combined.            Should Velodrome Be Forced to Operate Without OP Incentives?  TLDR: Velodrome has demonstrated the highest ROI in terms of ecosystem growth of any governance or partner fund grant to date. The primary impact of pulling back on incentives would be to slow or reverse that ecosystem growth while simultaneously continuing the flow of incentives to less effective programs on other DEXs making comparative evaluations of different programs more challenging. Incentives already represent a declining proportion of our total activity and we expect that to continue to shrink over the course of this grant.            Does Granting Velodrome Harm Other DEXs?  TLDR: Ecosystem native DEXs and multi-chain DEXs have different goals and incentives when it comes to growing Optimism and cannot be easily compared. Overall though, all should be evaluated / granted equally in terms of the growth multiple they can return and growing ecosystem activity will benefit all.  Summary We hope you\u2019ve found this summary helpful and will continue to add it if/when new topics are raised to make the overall thread a bit easier to navigate as we move into the voting page. Thank you for reading! ",

Even though I\u2019ve had some disagreements with the Velodrome team in the past, I can\u2019t deny that they have stimulated a lot of activity on Optimism, especially in regards to their liquidity mining program and the numerous protocol collaborations as a result of it. Before Velodrome launched their program with OP incentives, the liquidity situation on Optimism was quite shallow. You could hardly swap even minor amounts of ETH without slippage those days. Today swaps for ETH are as competitive on Optimism as most other chains/rollups with Velodrome being the leading DEX (by liquidity). In regards to OP incentives for vote-locking $VELO, I think it\u2019s an aggressive strategy but one that is logical given that LPs will be receiving $VELO rewards, and those LPs are OP community members and ecosystem token holders after all. So essentially the value is distributed among Optimism ecosystem protocols, aligning values accordingly. This proposal will essentially extend their OP liquidity mining program to Optimism\u2019s 1 year anniversary and ensure Optimism remains appealing to new entrants and competitive in that time. IMO Velodrome has been a net positive for Optimism and I think they\u2019ll continue to be so. ",

With the committee not reaching consensus, I\u2019ll however vote Against. I mentioned earlier as a request to committees that at Cycle 8 we have reached a point where it\u2019s time to carefully evaluate the results of prior cycles and be increasingly more stringent about grants. Particularly for repeat projects, we have to be very particular. So, I\u2019m going to practice that here. While Governance Fund has certainly benefited activity and user acquisition on Optimism, in my opinion it has far lagged the $OP tokens that have been distributed - not just Velodrome, but across the board. Arbitrum One has continued to grow organically without any incentives, and continues to be the leading smart contract L2 - further muddying the waters. My impression of this proposal - and skimming through the 140 comments - is this approximately maintains status quo without bringing any new innovation to user acquisition that we are seeking. Sure, continued incentives will onboard more users, but there\u2019s also a heavy cost in misallocating $OP tokens to mercenary liquidity farmers, whose time shouldn\u2019t be extended for an entire year or so. We have seen ecosystems like Avalanche & NEAR plundered by long-term liquidity mining, with nothing to show for today - they remain veritable ghost chains. Generally, I personally don\u2019t like to see incentives that are aimed at mining liquidity and growing TVL, and I\u2019ve also written extensively about the risks of doing so while Optimism is still heavily centralized. Further, we have reached a point where liquidity isn\u2019t the bottleneck on Optimism - we need to focus on growing other applications and onboard more users who can actually leverage all this excess liquidity. Velodrome has now established itself, and even without these incentives I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll continue to thrive, only losing some mercenary liquidity in the process. I have some other minor qualms, some of which are mentioned above, but overall, all things considered, in my opinion, we\u2019ve been there, done that. There\u2019ll be a more opportune time in the future to try this again - new ideas to incentivize user acquisition, more activity across other usecases, a more mature Optimism, a bull market etc. ",

Of course, this is subjective, and some may argue TVLs, staked amounts and trading volumes are more important, but I disagree - it\u2019s all about growing a dedicated userbase with diverse activity at this stage - we have already achieved sufficient liquidity. So, my opinion is the bottleneck now is no longer liquidity, but onboarding users. So, we should focus on different forms of incentives and proposals across a diverse set of usecases and see how that develops before considering returning back to traditional DeFi incentives. The ultimate goal would be to surpass BSC - which is #2 to Ethereum L1 - with XM DAUs and 50M+ tx/day, but of course that\u2019s a long term goal. ",

I\u2019m not a core team member these days, but know the team very well. Thank you @polynya for this response; I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment around grant performance; reporting has been sparse and comms around post-grant activity barely exist. Accountability is hugely important, and Velodrome are the the first project to document, analyse and share performance data demonstrating the success of their grant programme, which is something that should really be a requirement of grant recipients. However, this is a tactical focus and it is far more difficult to measure the exponential strategic impact of outreach, business development, relationship building and friction reduction. I\u2019d like to re-amplify a comment from @bebis of Byte Masons below:     bebis:  There\u2019s a lot of technical analysis going on here which I think distracts a bit from the value being added by the Velodrome team.  They\u2019re on-boarding a ton of people the hard way - with actual customer/client services. They\u2019re getting teams and users invested long-term in the ecosystem\u2019s success. They\u2019re the main Optimism point of contact if you\u2019re a builder/developer. Their bribing system makes operations much lighter for small teams and startups.  They\u2019re doing the hard, high-effort stuff that most aren\u2019t willing to. I\u2019d consider any proposal they put forth extremely seriously.   It\u2019s important to note that Velodrome has had zero fundraising, private investment or token raise. The entire project has been bootstrapped on a small $150k grant and has been running lean (extremely lean) ever since. It takes an inordinate amount of time and effort to simply manage the current project relationships, never mind nurturing and building new ones as an increasingly important first engagement point for Optimism, all while continuing to develop the product itself (and engage heavily in governance!). I myself have been approached by a number of protocols looking to deploy on Optimism (redirected to Optimism bizdev), despite not being Velodrome core team; Velodrome is seen as a portal to the ecosystem due to the ability to quickly deploy deep accessible liquidity, a quick response time, support from a team with a great network, easy composability and willingness to work with fellow builders (example: Velodrome Sugar). This is an exponential multiplier; Velodrome are not only onboarding users of the platform, but a range of protocols, who bring their own communities, users, TVL and expertise. Competition between L2s (and alt-L1s) is fierce and margins razor thin; this grant can be seen as allowing Velodrome to continue its growth and maintain an edge over other rollup competitors, continuing to onboard projects who may well do similar. Focusing on TVL and liquidity as the primary metrics is, to me, shortsighted, although those metrics also demonstrate the value of the project to the ecosystem. Accessibility is super important; those of us here who are actually builders know the pain of getting a response from key ecosystem personnel, generating the \u2018right kind\u2019 of liquidity (retail accessible) without greatly affecting your economics, navigating bureaucratic governance, plugging into new tech infrastructure etc. The Velodrome team have demonstrated their ability to remove these frictions time and time again; this should, in my opinion, be an important factor for delegates to consider.

I am Smerdyakov of the OpenX Project, I speak about our project but I only speak for myself. Two months ago we arrived on Optimism from a truly plundered blockchain, albeit not one plundered by excessive liquidity mining. Our project ran on Harmony for more than a year. We know too well what conditions create a functioning DeFi ecosystem, what inhibits their development, and what conditions can ultimately destroy it. We chose Optimism for its obvious dedication to builders who are dead-set on re-creating and inventing powerful but accessible blockchain-native financial instruments. I want to briefly share with you some of the value we created that was destroyed. Our developers had just pushed a fractional-routing aggregator which, to this day, is used by Harmony traders to maximize the liquidity that remains on chain. We were busy working on governance-focused NFTs containing underlying LP tokens to automate away many of the \u201csteps\u201d between the initial onboarding of a new user to decentralized finance and their full participation in all of the benefits it has to offer. We needed a secure blockchain to recreate our vision, and we needed a capital efficient strategy to bootstrap. We had zero doubt our project\u2019s innovations would generate revenue - but revenue isn\u2019t liquidity. My humble opinion: The importance of the veCRV / Solidly / Velodrome and similar models has simply not been understood. The importance of what Velodrome calls \u201cwhite glove service\u201d even more so. We mentioned our \u201chome\u201d blockchain collapsed, but perhaps the reader is unfamiliar with the story of the Horizon Bridge. We encourage users investigate it, it is a very instructive case in securing interoperability among blockchains. The consequences for us were severe. The two audits we performed on Harmony buy us nothing here. We arrived with the initial liquidity we raised from an ad hoc pre-sale of our NFTs on Harmony and about 3 BTC in out-of-pocket value our Team provided. We needed a capital efficient strategy to bootstrap sticky liquidity as an unaudited, teensy-cap project. Velodrome did their due diligence and onboarded us. They whitelisted our experimental SushiBar after we pitched it, the same is true for our optimization of cvxCRV. Having an established project with the ability to onboard and incentivize experimental projects is necessary for the further innovation of native-blockchain instruments. Half of this is due to the capital efficiency of what we\u2019ll call an \u201cinitial value-proposition\u201d - that is, a \u201cbribe,\u201d although this word makes granny cringe. This purchases more than a week of liquidity. It purchases a week of exposure by way of introduction to the ecosystem via a decentralized marketplace of deep core liquidity. A place where bigger wallets make trades. A place where users can learn of a new listing, a new financial concept or instrument even, and go from there. (The importance of Core liquidity has not been discussed either from what I have read here.) If there is to be a \u201cCore\u201d Liquidity market place the team behind it must bear great responsibilities - they must be excellent market-makers! Nevermind the difficulties of managing partnerships across dozens of projects from every imaginable timezone and background. This leads me to Velodrome\u2019s team. They describe themselves as white glove. Our experience has been more than that. They embraced our project, true, but it was their constructive criticism that allowed us to re-imagine some of our ideas. This facilitated innovation. Our SushiBar will now be used as the vote-escrowed foundation for solving the rebase and equitable tx fee distribution issues inherent in veNFTs. Their critiques of our cvxCRV fork forced us to examine cvxCRV\u2019s influence on Curve and re-imagine our offering as a perpetual bond built with mechanisms that offset the parasitic influences derivatives-without-programmed-parity introduce. This then inspired us to develop a reserve-and-peg-by-parity mechanism we believe will help re-introduce perpetual bonds as legitimate, blockchain-native financial tools that can tokenize locked value, serve as a bond, all while serving a perpetual function in our exchange. Velodrome traded their white gloves for boxing mitts when it came to analyzing our ideas. They did this to protect the space they created while honoring the commitment made in their documentation to reward sophisticated Defi users, they did so with their feedback and patience. If there is to be a whitelisting process to protect and foster innovation before full decentralization is possible for an exchange such as this, it must be curated by a team committed to onboarding innovation. Dozens of hours spent helping a teensy-cap maximize capital efficiency - has this been understood? It is their passion for constructive blockchain-native development that allows Velodrome\u2019s team to function as a Hospitality Tent for the Optimism Ecosystem. The fact of our being here to share our success is proof-of-onboarding enough for us. We have numbers to share concerning our capital efficiency upon request, especially as it relates to our liquidity-balancing strategies. These will only further substantiate the success of Velodrome and the capital efficient onboarding options it presents. (As a project:) We believe Velodrome has come closer than anyone to perfecting the models that have produced sustainable decentralized market-making strategies and potential.  We support their proposal 100%. ",

The experience was buttery smooth, and delivered a fantastic liquidity marketplace all under one roof (which requires at least 3 roofs to accomplish on mainnet between Curve/Convex/Votium).

Every week Velodrome is highlighting and onboarding a new project that I can explore. I can say that SEVERAL of the projects that have bribed me through Velodrome have also gained me as a user.

That is why I hope you\u2019ll indulge us pushing on this just a little more.     polynya:  I personally don\u2019t like to see incentives that are aimed at mining liquidity and growing TVL \u2026 there\u2019s\u2026 a heavy cost in misallocating $OP tokens to mercenary liquidity farmers.   I think this is fair critique of many proposals, but not ours. Our objective isn\u2019t aimed at increasing TVL or rewarding mercenary capital, it is to substantially lower the barriers of entry to Optimism for projects and protocols, making it easier for them to onboard to and grow within the ecosystem. You can see this in the fact that we do not directly allocate any OP to mercenary liquidity farmers. The OP instead flows (via a variety of mechanisms) to veVELO lockers who by virtue of the required 4 year lock have (as @TokenBrice put it) entered into \u201ca long-term commitment with Velodrome and Optimism.\u201d Accessing each of these incentives likewise requires them to match the value at a 2x-9x level (either by virtue of locking capital or putting up the bulk of the bribe). These are mercenary resistant incentives. Liquidity mining of VELO tokens (which take pressure off of OP) and the resulting TVL growth are really just second order effects of attracting and retaining projects that will (in your words) drive \u201cuser acquisition, more activity across other use-cases, a more mature Optimism.\u201d Arbitrum\u2019s greatest strength is really in the fact that it has strong ecosystem of apps (with lets be honest, significant funding) that people actively want to use. Our goal on Optimism needs to be to attract support the next wave of apps and builders so that they can do the same for Optimism, building the thriving and self-sustaining economy powered by retroactive public goods envisioned by the Foundation. Velodrome is helping to do just that.     polynya:  My impression of this proposal \u2026 is this approximately maintains status quo   So what is Velodrome\u2019s status quo? I would argue that it is currently the single biggest engine of ecosystem growth at the moment. You can see that in the fact that it has onboarded 32 new projects to the ecosystem, with most of them having not needed to rely on grants from the Governance Fund to do so. And it is doing this at a fraction of the cost of other protocols. According to the Foundations analysis of grants to date, the 42.6M OP granted thus far has earned:  A 100% increase in transactions at a cost of 676 OP per incremental transaction A 74% increase in TVL (60M) at a cost of about .3 OP per incremental dollar  In contrast, Velodrome\u2019s grant of 3M OP from OPLabs has thus far earned:  A 100% increase in transactions, at a cost of 40 OP per incremental transaction A 400% increase in TVL ($65M), at a cost of .03 OP per incremental dollar  That is still too much to be paying in perpetuity and isn\u2019t a complete picture of impact, but it is a 16x better ROI on Velodrome per transaction and at 10x better ROI per dollar in liquidity. And it doesn\u2019t even take into account the downstream effects of the 32 project\u2019s we\u2019ve onboarded and the users, transactions, and activity that they are driving. We need to remember that is in part because Velodrome is offering Optimism 31x the level of co-incentives as other DEXs and 1.6x the value of the underlying grant request: $6.5M versus the projected $360k offered collectively by protocols worth billions of dollars. It is nearly half the entire value of Governance Fund grants slated to be approved over the same period and is real tangible ecosystem stimulus that doesn\u2019t need to come out of Optimism\u2019s pockets. This reinforces to me the idea when it comes to evaluating Velodrome\u2019s grant performance to date, we\u2019ve been the exception and not rule. Playing a huge role in mitigating the worst effects of the suboptimal grant allocations to date. An argument for extending what is working, especially while taking a step back to reevaluate what hasn\u2019t.     polynya:  So, we should focus on different forms of incentives and proposals across a diverse set of usecases and see how that develops before considering returning back to traditional DeFi incentives.   I think broadly speaking we in agreement about the outcome that we want to create. We need a rich ecosystem of applications that can attract the kind of users and activity that can sustain the ecosystem, especially once the market comes roaring back. I know you see us in the context of broader failures of grants to date, but I hope that maybe we\u2019ve made the case that in this specific case doubling down on a proven strategy would be more impactful than abandoning it (especially knowing that it will be up again for reevaluation in just 3 months). In either case, appreciate the consideration. ",

I am new to crypto over the last 2 years, and in that time have come to very much espouse the general ethos of ethereum and its various L2\u2019s. In the last bull run Main net was essentially unusable for users such as myself, and I was hearing all about the various L2\u2019s and very hopeful for their release. I ended up bridging over to OP very early, and I hate to use this phrase. But at the time, there was nothing to do here but hope for an airdrop. The first protocol that changed my attitude about OP and it really having some lifeblood and exciting innovation, was velodrome. I was in their initial twitter spaces with them and the op team. They committed to build alongside OP for the good of the ecosystem from the very start.  I recently became involved and interested in a second OP protocol, Sonne finance, that launched directly on top of velodrome, and has been aided greatly by their relationship with velodrome. In discord I have even asked the velo team about their plans to operate across other L2\u2019s as well, and imo, you will not find a team more focused and dedicated to OP as they passionately make the case for why OP is the only place they want to be. I believe some of the proliferation on arbitrum is simply a prelude to them offering similar liquidity incentives to what op has done. I do believe op incentives are performing exactly as designed, in attracting and exciting users, such as myself  as well as protocols like Sonne finance, and open x, mentioned above directly through the partnership with velodrome. I understand the desire to see organic growth without the added stimulus of op liquidity incentives, however I believe at this early stage, bootstrapping of users, protocols, and liquidity are still very much pertinent goals for OP. As OP tokens must eventually be distributed anyway, what better way, than bootstrapping new users and protocols, and building general excitement around OP through partnering with one of the biggest proponents of the long term OP vision velodrome.

The grant allows continued growth, facilitating an over-performing team to continue to deliver a high level of service to new protocols either building on Optimism, currently on-boarding or actively looking to. One could argue that some projects may not have chosen Optimism if it weren\u2019t for the Velodrome team\u2019s outreach, pitch and onboarding assistance; by not accelerating the current trajectory we may well stymie Opti protocol growth (of which any one could be \u201cour GMX\u201d). This grant, I think, directly affects Optimism\u2019s competitiveness, not just Velodrome\u2019s. I agree liquidity isn\u2019t the current bottleneck; what is currently missing is a (or more than one) native ecosystem that necessitates adjacent builders to move to Optimism (Lens is a great example on Polygon; if you\u2019re utilising a Social Graph, you have to build there). This is a business development problem; we\u2019ve seen time and time again that  dev grants alone can\u2019t necessarily solve this, you need evangelistic, committed ecosystem-centric builders aggressively bringing in partners who they think may become foundational elements. One could argue greater funding of bizdev at Foundation level would possibly have a similar outcome, but in this case we see user on-boarding (friction reduction through bridge/infra familiarity), higher liquidity plus greater composability on top of on-the-ground focused outreach.

Great example. You are pointing to  the wallet of Inverse Finance, one of the protocols that we\u2019ve successfully onboarded to the Optimism Ecosystem from mainnet. They had no presence on Optimism prior to their granting of a veNFT, have not applied for or received a direct grant from Optimism\u2019s Governance Fund, and are currently in the process of expanding their presence on the network. The Governance Fund to date has granted about 46,600,000 OP to 41 project at an average cost of ~1,130,000 per project attracted. You appear to trying to cast aspersions over a net-new project incentivized with about 10,000 OP over two months? That is a 113x better ROI than governance is currently getting. Did you notice what they did with the funds after swapping them? They locked their investment for 4 years in Optimism Ecosystem in the form of veVELO. This veVELO will allow them to create revenue positive liquidity programs without needing to rely on external incentives or OP grants.

                    "content": "There are too many valuable comments here, but as Sonne Finance, we want to add what we think about the proposal and Velodrome in general. While it\u2019s very important to investigate as deep as possible, it sometimes might lead to missing the bigger picture. Firstly, Velodrome is the point of contact for new projects. There is no better place to launch a project, while incentivizing liquidity. One of the main reasons of our launch on Optimism was Velodrome.     Mingyue:  It is of great significance to grant more op to native optimism protocols(i.e.Velodrome) rather than those mutichain projects such as uniswap and curve.Uniswap and curve\u2019s boom will do very little help to optimism\u2019s prosperous,and,their TVL is also not steady,that is to say when op grants over,those TVL would more probably move to other chains(Arbitrum,Zksync,and many other new chains) in lack of enough incentives.Only native protocol can help optimism\u2019s big prosperous in bull market and grow up in bear market.   Secondly, Velodrome is one of the few native projects out there having success on Optimism. We saw what happened when OP incentives are gone from non-native protocol:  image801\u00d7534 24.9 KB  People simply farmed OP rewards, dumped them and leave. Total market size of AAVE dropped from $1.4B to $400m in just under a week. But anything Velodrome spends, is almost guaranteed to stay in the ecosystem:  Lock bonus: Users have to lock veVELO for 4 years in order to get an OP bonus. They have to stay 4 years in Optimism ecosystem. Bribe matches: Another project have to put skin in the game in order to have this boost. And for that, that project needs to focus and compete with others in Optimism ecosystem, which creates a positive feedback loop for whole ecosystem. It incentivizes both project launches on Optimism and having deeper liquidity. Key Pairs: That\u2019s where we are skeptical at, we don\u2019t believe further incentivization of key pairs should be there. And it creates unfair advantage to some projects. Or we can argue that Sonne should be a key pair too, but it would create unfair advantage for us as well.  We believe that the success of Velodrome, will lead to success of Optimism ecosystem in general. Though we have some suggestions:  Decrease 1.5M Locking incentives to 750k. While it might be helpful for new users to explore Optimism ecosystem through Velodrome, spending 1.5M OP to incentivize locking VELO is a bit too much. Key ecosystem pairs incentivization might not be fair for all. OP/USDC and wETH/USDC deep liquidity is important to have on-chain, but we believe other incentivizations are not necessary. Competition is what keeps action alive, and that suggestion is against fair competition. We believe that wBTC/USDC pair for example is far more important than other pairs right now. It might be decreased to 500k OP, and only for wETH, OP and wBTC against USDC or in between.  Other than that, as Sonne Finance, we hope that the proposal passes. Velodrome is playing a huge part on Optimism\u2019s success, and we believe that it will continue to do so in the future as well. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019d like to speak on this \u201cCore Liquidity\u201d concept a bit more, I believe it needs clarification. I am no expert in Game Theory and I am not concerned with traditional applications of these terms as much as I am in making this point as I understand it: In a decentralized marketplace there needs to be some situation that no individual project - or collection of projects - could improve upon by branching off and trying it themselves. This would simply split liquidity and, while that can have its advantages, it defeats the purpose of consolidating deep liquidity to remove unnecessary PI that deters larger swaps. But why should Velodrome be the place for this? It\u2019s not really a matter of why, it\u2019s a matter of because. It is because they have already taken the risks and achieved it in a capital efficient manner. They are the Core Liquidity for Optimism because they developed the best model to retain sticky liquidity. This is a proof of past performance, and regarding future developments I\u2019m not sure what else there is to go by. I\u2019d like to add regarding liquidity and bringing new users to Optimism: It took us about three days to review the opportunities offered by Velodrome to understand what it meant for us. The 3 BTC in value we bribed is value we brought to this chain because of Velodrome. The locking airdrops for users allow new entrants to catch up. We say this without the added benefit of receiving the airdrops as a project because we are an aggregator of veVELO and are thus not eligible. Dozens (or more) users followed us from Harmony. Some bribed out-of-pocket once they understood the capital efficiency of the opportunity. We are proud of our results but projects like OATH and SONNE have performed similar strategies to great success as well. Why emit a token with limited liquidity when you can create a speculative value proposition for it that also acts as an equitable distribution of emissions. More generally, my thoughts on the progression from veCRV \u2192 veNFT (Solidly) \u2192 Velodrome is that a large step has been taken in the formation of sustainable decentralized market-making. This growth will not produce its ripest fruit until its possibilities have been comprehended and exhausted. It will take months, perhaps years, of experimentation to bear this out. Velodrome has been wildly successful already by every measure of capital efficiency. Speaking of positive feedback loops, I know of none better than entrusting a proven good steward of their talents with more capital to exercise them. How users choose to use their bribe rewards and airdrops is of course their business. I\u2019d only like to point out the VELO is one of the few tokens on chain that has chosen huge price exposure to the OP token itself via their highly incentivized VELO-OP pool. We may fear mercenary liquidity miners but users capable of thinking more than two weeks ahead understand the liquidity looping possibilities created by these incentives and will maximize their liquidity provision and return possibilities. Velodrome has taken the riskier proposition of betting on Optimism by exposing the value of their project to it. The very success of the VELO token is thereby inextricably linked to the good stewardship of their incentive packages. ",

Deeply appreciate your open mindedness, ser.     polynya:  I\u2019d very much like to see proposals focused on bizdev & marketing rather than liquidity mining.   This is an interesting point-of-view I hadn\u2019t really considered as an implication of your thoughts so far. For whatever it is worth, as someone who has spent most of their career working in those domains I think the Governance Fund would be wise to avoid directly subsidizing business development or marketing activities. It is a squishy space that is difficult to assess objectively and that can lead to ineffective (or abusive) allocations of funds. That said, I agree that they can play an incredibly important role to ecosystem growth, so the question is what is the best way to enable them? I submit that you do that by supporting and removing the barriers the projects demonstrating the most competency in doing that business development and marketing work successfully. This thread is full of projects and protocols (and users) attesting to the Velodrome Team doing just that. Indeed, Velodrome has actually onboarded more net-new protocols (20 for 3M OP) than the Governance Fund itself (18 for 7.4M OP) and did so at a fraction of the cost. That is why I think it should carry some weight when we the functional SMEs in this area say that we don\u2019t need grants to pay us to do or subsidize the costs of the work. We need grants that have demonstrated an ability to lower the barriers of entry to the ecosystem so we can continue facilitating the growth of new protocols. As long as the ecosystem continues to grow, we can continue to self-fund the ecosystem leading marketing / biz dev efforts we\u2019re leading while keeping the millions of dollars in incentives we\u2019re generating focused exclusively on Optimism\u2019s growth. That is what this grant is enabling, not liquidity mining for its own sake. ",

This thread is extremely in-depth, with a lot of high-quality arguments from both sides - I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts from myself. Velodrome onboarded our protocol to the Optimism Ecosystem by offering us a veNFT at their launch. I have nothing but great things to say about the team at Velodrome, they have been a pleasure to work with so far. Bringing our decentralized stablecoin, DOLA, across to Optimism has so far been a success, and we have already begun building (first smart contract on optimism besides our token deployed a couple of weeks ago!). I notice that someone previously cited our DAO Multisig Wallet executing a few swaps of OP \u2192 VELO, I\u2019d like to highlight that our many swaps of USDC (bridged from Ethereum L1) to VELO (to be locked for 4 years) were excluded, you can see over $20k in transactions here and plenty more to come! As Alex highlighted above, the OP incentivisation that we have received from Velodrome (around 10k) has not only helped onboard us, but led to us investing significantly more $ than received and building on the chain. I believe that this behaviour will be replicated with other protocols as a result of Velodrome\u2019s strategy. I am in full support of Velodrome receiving what they have requested, I am confident that they are one of the best-placed projects in the ecosystem to help turbocharge the continual growth of Optimism as a successful L2. At Inverse, we have a lot of potential for big plans on the chain, so it\u2019s in our interest for the ecosystem to be as active/successful as possible. ",

But rather, it will return at least $7.6m to $11.4m in value based on the demonstrated performance of the original grant.   Our grant is dramatically over performing Governance Fund grants to date:     alexcutlerdoteth:  According to the Foundations analysis of grants to date, the 42.6M OP granted thus far has earned:  A 100% increase in transactions at a cost of 676 OP per incremental transaction A 74% increase in TVL (60M) at a cost of about .3 OP per incremental dollar  In contrast, Velodrome\u2019s grant of 3M OP from OPLabs has thus far earned:  A 100% increase in transactions, at a cost of 40 OP per incremental transaction A 400% increase in TVL ($65M), at a cost of .03 OP per incremental dollar        alexcutlerdoteth:  Indeed, Velodrome has actually onboarded more net-new protocols (20 for 3M OP) than the Governance Fund itself (18 for 7.4M OP) and did so at a fraction of the cost.   In short, the grant only looks large if you ignore baselines in terms of KPIs, massive co-investment, or demonstrated ROI multiples it has delivered. It remains significantly smaller in actual dollar terms than the one originally given to us by OPLabs. Repeatedly suggesting \u201cit is too big\u201d without directly engaging in this context isn\u2019t constructive, especially from someone who received their own incredibly generous grant but has yet to produce evidence of similar returns.

                    "content": "Hey @DanieleSalatti Appreciate you giving us a sense of where your head is at. Hope you\u2019ll indulge me probing on your thinking just a little bit more.     DanieleSalatti:  since the amount at stake is high   Can you give us an idea of what you\u2019d need to see to convince you that the ask wasn\u2019t actually high in any kind of comparative terms to other grants? Including those active up for votes at this moment? We\u2019ve tried to break this down any number of different ways.     DanieleSalatti:  community doesn\u2019t seem to be aligned   Can you give us an idea of what would convince you that community is actually fairly aligned? We\u2019ve done qualitative analysis on the commenters on this proposal and found 65% of them (24 total) to be positive with just 22% of them negative (8 total, 40% new accounts). This is mirrored pretty closely in the current voting where 55% of voters have voted yes (2636 total) where just 10% have against (515 total). You\u2019ll also notice that over 20 protocols and builders are supporting our proposal as wel. There is certainly a vocal minority opposed, but surely we need tools to see the bigger picture.     DanieleSalatti:  A vote against is a two way door (a new proposal can be submitted and discussed with more time), a vote for is not.   This I would push back on a bit. A vote against is almost certainly a vote to put an indefinite end on what is arguably the most effective incentive program currently active as there is currently no timeline for \u201cSeason 3\u201d. The Optimism Foundation has already hinted that big changes are coming, so really no one knows when a new proposal could conceivably be put up for review let alone be approved/implemented. The protocols we\u2019re actively onboarding to the ecosystem (32 already and another 12 or so in the pipeline) need the ability carefully plan and model their expansion and investment in Optimism. The reliability and consistency of incentives is critical to that as builders like @TokenBrice, @cryptoharry, @Smerdyakov, and others have expressed in this discussion. Letting incentives lapse would not come without a significant cost and risks stalling the hard earned momentum we\u2019ve built. I will also note that this really isn\u2019t a lump-sum grant of 4M OP. It is a grant of 2M that gives governance the option of ending the program at the three month mark if they are not pleased with the results per the mechanism we designed with @Katie. Extending existing programs that have proven their effectiveness for three more months while securing our commitment to pump $6.5M in stimulus exclusively into the Optimism ecosystem feels far less risky than letting the program lapse. I will also add that this process is incredibly intensive and has taken our team away from the core work of our protocol for weeks on end now. I think we can deliver a lot more value if we can put our attention back on onboarding another protocols, not spending all of our time trying to persuade delegates of our value. ",

                    "content": "Voted yes - It seems like one of the main concerns around this proposal is grant size, which is understandable because this is a large request.  However, only half of the funds will be distributed up front, with the second half being contingent upon an efficacy report at the 2.5 month mark which I feel has been overlooked (see below).  This circumvents the issue of the team having to submit another proposal and go through this extremely labor intensive process (as shown by the 176 comments as of writing this) but also includes the accountability component which has been missing from previous proposals.     tao:  Based on feedback from key delegates and Optimism governance participants, we propose staging the delivery of the grant to allow for evaluation of its effectiveness. Details as follows:  Maintain grant amount as outlined above, but deliver only half of the funds up front. Deliver a full report on efficacy at the 2.5 month mark, to be submitted directly to governance Upon delivery of the report, open a 2 week window where anyone in governance can raise a proposal that, upon two delegate approvals, can proceed direct to snapshot to suspend further grant payments If none are submitted, funding continues    The Velodrome team has been extremely successful with growing the ecosystem (which is the purpose of the governance fund) with their previous grant as shown extensively by data and metrics.  This is an impressive grant performance, backed by verifiable numbers and data. We should be rewarding teams that are building on Optimism. None of the funds requested are going to any internal operational costs, this grant is 100% focused on bootstrapping liquidity, lowering barriers to entry, and acquiring new users, which again, is the purpose of the governance fund. I would also like to point out that the Velodrome has responded to every single concern raised with a thoughtful response backed by numbers, facts and technical analysis.  There has clearly been a massive amount of effort on the Velodrome team to address concerns and move this proposal forward which should not be taken lightly. I would encourage others to look past the grant size and focus on the data and metrics that have shown the success of this project so far.  These are the types of grants and projects the governance fund should be supporting imo. ",

I think this is more evidence that liquidity mining programs are beneficial to boostrap some initial liquidity, but after the initial couple of weeks it\u2019s best to let the protocols organically find their equilibrium. As such, we should focus more on user onboarding and diverse activity, rather than liquidity mining and chasing TVLs repeatedly - particularly given other factors like the high risk of Optimism\u2019s current centralized state. Earlier, I had written my personal guidelines for what would qualify a project for a repeat grant: Polynya - Delegate Communication Thread -  Governance / Delegate Updates - Optimism Collective Having mulled over it, Velodrome does not meet my criteria. a) Rises in liquidity and adoption was largely frontloaded in July & August and growth has flatlined over time. Even if it had continued growing linearly, I would expect a gradual wind-down of incentives over time. b) Time has not passed yet without incentives to assess the effects. And c) there\u2019s no new approaches - it\u2019s still mostly about liquidity irrespective of adjacent narratives. As such, I have now voted Against. I\u2019ll be following along the conversation, and I\u2019ll be open to changing my vote to Abstain if more compelling arguments emerge. My hope would be to assess the effects of Velodrome without incentives, and to see a more compelling proposal in the future based on a) what\u2019s learned from that and b) new strategies to onboard users beyond focusing on liquidity - already been there, done that with the first grant. If the vote passes, I would expect significant increase in activity on Velodrome & the wider Optimism community versus what has come before. If all I see is status quo or mild growth, it\u2019s not good enough for a repeat grant. ",

Our focus from day 1 has been to attract talent to come build on Optimism, and tbh we\u2019ve done an excellent job. Just look at the teams we\u2019re working with, including many of which have taken the time to express their support in this proposal. This grant is designed to incentivize protocols first and foremost by rewarding projects that take a stake in the ecosystem (bribing and/or locking). We believe that by increasing the diversity of protocols on Optimism, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate the overall network flywheel of more users > more protocols > more users. But onboarding protocols takes time. Our ask here is to extend a program that has had incredible success attracting teams willing to build. We\u2019re in active communication with dozens of teams that are planning to launch on Optimism or have already done so through us. Consider the case of Sonne Finance, a protocol with >$28M TVL and growing. They leveraged Velodrome\u2019s mechanics to design a sustainable token launch strategy:  Paired USDC raised from TGE to create SONNE-USDC LP Staked SONNE-USDC LP on Velodrome and bribed the pool with more SONNE Redirected VELO emissions collected from their staked LP to their own platform as rewards   image1920\u00d71080 54.7 KB  By redirecting VELO rewards, they were able to majorly reduce their SONNE burn rate during a crucial period and demonstrated that Velodrome really is a base layer protocol.

Totally aside from the merits of the proposal (which we believe are significant) it is really exciting to see proposals taken so seriously be DeFi protocol teams. I\u2019ll be sharing this one as an example to other protocols seeking grants and partnerships with Lido going forward. Lido fully supports this proposal. As many have attested to, Velodrome has been a great advocate and resource for the Optimism ecosystem. They\u2019ve been super helpful to us as we planned the migration of wstETH to Optimism and have proven to be reliable, smart partners to us so far. In case it is helpful - I offer Lido Analytics\u2019 Dune dashboard for wstETH on Optimism: wstETH on Optimism We encourage the Optimism community to approve the Velodrome team\u2019s proposal and have faith that their work in supporting the growth of the Optimism network will be worth every penny.

They are asking for $4m $OP They already received $3m $OP back in July We perpetuate the unsustainable cycle of yield hunting by making people move to optimism to get extra incentives with the foundation footing the bill.  Pros  The project is definitely a good one for optimism. Most protocols that have worked with velodrome have only good things to say about them I have used velodrome. Pretty smooth experience. Definitely good for the ecosystem They responded to most feedback here in the forums.  Just like @polynya stated I would like to see velodrome without incentives for a bit to see how such a protocol can stand on its own without someone else injecting artificial yield to attract users. At some point we really need to consider sustainability of the ecosystem. ",

                    "content": "I think velodrome is really really cool, and this is a fantastic proposal, but I chose to vote against this proposal for similar reasons as Lefteris. The main thing is that 4m $OP (even if it is broken into 2 parts) is just too large of a proposal, despite that, from the metrics, it is a totally legitimate ask. I think @polynya nails it here:     polynya:  we have reached a point where liquidity isn\u2019t the bottleneck on Optimism - we need to focus on growing other applications and onboard more users who can actually leverage all this excess liquidity.   It would be good to see the $OP in our coffers focus more towards onboarding new projects with diverse users outside instead of bribing more LPs that will likely leave when the incentives dry up. ",
