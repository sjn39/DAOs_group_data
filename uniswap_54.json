I am a designer and software engineer who\u2019s been involved in Ethereum-related things for awhile now. Lately I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about UNI governance, and in particular, initiatives like the UNI Grants Program. I don\u2019t have a complex pitch here, but my general thought is that there\u2019s an opportunity to vastly increase the amount of interest in and participation in UNI governance, and the most important thing right now is to have a greater number of individuals who are publicly speaking about proposals and putting forth new ideas. I would like to be one of those people. Here are some things I\u2019m interested in right now:  Continuing (and evolving) the UNI Grants Program to get more leverage out of treasury funds Lowering vote threshold for submitting proposals to governance (due to token price increases) Creating more regular, structured time for community discussion via public community calls or in another format Speaking more on Twitter about what\u2019s happening with UNI governance, what proposals are being worked on, and how to get involved  Right now, I have very few delegate votes here. This pitch is the beginning of my work to become a more prominent and helpful voice in this community. If you\u2019d like to delegate any votes to me, you can do that here: https://sybil.org/#/delegates/uniswap/0xB0623C91c65621df716aB8aFE5f66656B21A9108 Feel free to ask questions below, or find me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/ Thanks!
