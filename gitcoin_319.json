Earthquakes in Turkey have directly affected approximately 13.5 million people, leaving them homeless. People who survived the earthquake that took place during the night hours when sleep was at its deepest had to struggle with harsh winter conditions. In total, 6444 buildings were destroyed. When you consider the average number of apartments in these apartments and the demographic structure in the region, it would not be difficult to predict that the number of deaths will increase very rapidly, not linearly, but parabolicly. It\u2019s the fourth day of the earthquake and the death toll is about to reach 20 thousand. Only the number of injured in the wreckage is 60 thousand and those who survived the earthquake from the 4th day will unfortunately have lost their lives due to the inadequacy of the rescue teams. the disaster in Turkey; It is one of the biggest earthquake disasters of the last century.

As for the request, here is my contribution Additionally, I\u2019d love to work with a designer from the Turkish community to create 3 tiers of POAPs Tier 1 - $10 or more Tier 2 - $100 or more Tier 3 - $1,000 or more We can work with the POAP team and FDD analysts to retroactively send out the POAPs to anyone who donates to the addresses above or to a specific gitcoin donation address if preferred. That might be better. What does everyone think about this plan? Calling in attention support from MMM @CoachJonathan @Viriya @garysheng ",
