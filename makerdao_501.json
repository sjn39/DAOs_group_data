I\u2019d pledge to not be the resident pessimist or so curmudgeonly next year, but l prefer to just say I\u2019ll put in more effort to follow the @LongForWisdom admonishment to assume the best intentions in others. Maker has sucked me in to the point I have left archaeology, and the best part of any endeavor is, of course, the people. Have a wonderful New Year celebration tonight, and everyone stay safe from drunk drivers and coronavirus ",

It\u2019s very rewarding to read (and re-read) you on the chat. Learnt a ton about economic history and regulation, I\u2019m very glad you didn\u2019t stick to archeology. ps: if you ever decide to write about archeology please let us know, I think more than one of us will be interested in reading it!
