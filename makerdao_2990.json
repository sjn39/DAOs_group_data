We\u2019re happy to have with us Shashank from Leverj. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a derivatives decentralized platorm, so we\u2019re going to speak a little about perpetual positions, futures, and whatnot. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   Leverj Shashank Tiwari Presentation 00:38 Shashank Tiwari1920\u00d71080 58.9 KB 01:42 - \u201cI don\u2019t have a Powerpoint type of presentation. I will just walk through the concepts, show you things that are live. Let me give first a little introduction on the story of Leverj, the underlying technology and why and how this is important to the entire ecosystem\u201d 07:26 - \u201cOn the basis of that, Leverj was able to realize a high-speed decentralized derivatives platform [\u2026] There is our token, which drives the governance and some of the security contracts. Plus it also allows people to earn rewards if the stake actively. That token is L2\u201d 09:06 - Juan asks Shashank for a short definition for \u201cderivative\u201d and what kinds of derivatives Leverj has (09:06) 1920\u00d71080 107 KB 12:14 - \u201cLet me try to address that question about derivatives\u201d 17:17 - \u201cI\u2019m talking primarily about the fiat asset class, which is basically the regular markets across different asset classes. What we have seen in the crypto world is that there has been a lot of activity around basic future contracts or basic contracts that let you trade on prices of the main crypto assets a little ahead in time\u201d 19:18 - Juan asks Shashank to elaborate on the difference between futures and perpetuals (19:18) 1920\u00d71080 187 KB 25:05 - \u201cIf you look at the site that I\u2019m sharing right now, this is essentially the Leverj IO perpetual trading platform. Let me mention a few things about this contract\u201d 1920\u00d71080 116 KB 29:55 - \u201cYou will end up seeing a wallet like this. The idea of this Gluon wallet is that you have things which exist in your main chain [\u2026] Once I\u2019ve connected and registered my account, I take a part of it or all and move it over to the Plasma wallet; and now that it\u2019s available on the Plasma wallet, I can use it to trade these derivatives\u201d 34:49 - Juan asks where the prices are coming from. Regarding margin, he further asks how the liquidations work, at what percentages they kick in 1920\u00d71080 143 KB 40:18 - \u201cLet me talk about liquidations a little bit. And in the interest of time I\u2019m also going to talk a bit more about L2 per se, the token that we\u2019re here for\u201d 1920\u00d71080 185 KB 52:22 - \u201cIn terms of the Maker world, how it plays in here and what might make sense here, if you look at the Maker world and Leverj as two venues and how they could play well together, there are three or four things that pop up in my mind right away\u2026\u201d\" Discussion  46:50 - How long does it take for me to deposit ETH? Rollups takes seven or five days; CK takes half an hour with Loopring\u2026 48:41 - Did you go over the frontrunning part of things? Is something like fill-or-kill available on your platform? 56:36 - Can you comment on what the fees are? Also, you mentioned signing a couple of contracts, so maybe you can comment on gas fees too 01:01:00 - I guess it depends on the price of the gas fees, Can you give us a rough idea on how much it is to fund or withdraw the account? 01:01:55 - You are competing against the ftxs of the world, dydxs, Decentralize\u2026 Would you say that\u2019s the downside risk, that you\u2019re competing against ftx, dydx, and the fact that L2s are still brand new and we still don\u2019t know which ones are going to survive?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 01:06:05  Thank you, Shashank, for coming. It was very nice to have you. Thank you, everyone else, for coming. Next week we\u2019re going to have Mona El Isa from Melon Protocol discussing more interesting projects  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.
