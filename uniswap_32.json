We now have enough details on v3 to get the liquidity rewards debate back on track.  As it was the case before, it\u2019s a really tough question to answer. To make a long story short, Uniswap pretty much proved that it could keep a dominant marketshare while not rewarding its LPs. Now that v3 is here, a new question arises : should we choose to bootstrap v3\u2019s launch with a brand new, limited (1 month or so ?) liquidity mining campaign ? It would probably be a good thing to incentivize users to take on the new smart contracts risks at play here (and even more so on Optimism where risks are compounded) But, in the longer-term view, the old question still remains : Are we counting on v3\u2019s superiority alone to keep dominating the market while others (Curve, Sushi) are pumping out tokens most likely for the years to come. ? Inflation could be used as a tool. That\u2019s what most protocols are doing with varying degrees of success. Maybe we should consider electing a committee for liquidity mining questions (like we did for grants) Vive v3 ! Long live v3     ",

The author suggests using inflation as a tool and possibly electing a committee for liquidity mining questions.
