The latest executive which has passed but has not executed yet would lower USDC-A and PAX-A collateralization ratios to 103% and increase debt ceilings to meet the increased demand for DAI. Current proposed TUSD Parameters: Collateralization Ratio: 120% Debt Ceiling: 2M DAI Risk Premium: 0% The goal is this signal request is to modify the proposed TUSD Risk Parameters to match the USDC-A and PAX-A Vaults. This will also diversify the MCD collateral stablecoin pool from being primarily dominated by USDC. New Proposed TUSD Parameters: CR: The lower of 103% or the winning governance poll vote. RP: 4% - This is inline with USDC-A and PAX-A. Should Urgent Action be taken to modify the proposed TUSD Risk Parameters?     Yes - Urgent Action should be taken to modify the TUSD-A Risk Parameters No - Use the proposed TUSD-A parameters in the governance poll. Abstain     0 voters     What should the TUSD-A DC be set at?     2M DAI (current) 10M DAI 25M DAI 50M DAI Abstain     0 voters     TUSD currently has a circulating supply of 488M. There is a high amount of on-chain TUSD liquidity. 150M TUSD is in the curve ypool. 227M TUSD is in the swerve pool. TUSD recently upgraded their contracts. While they\u2019ve been audited by Peckshield and Certik there\u2019s a chance that there are hidden vulnerabilities.  Polls will close on 2020-09-17T16:00:00Z.

If the community has come to a consensus that they are comfortable having stablecoin fiat-backed collateralization ratios at 103% (and possibly even 101% down the road) then there is no reason we shouldn\u2019t onboard TUSD at the same CR.   That being said, with the TUSD contract being new, there is significant smart contract risk. Even audits aren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s really a matter of withstanding the test of time. One just has to look at the recent bZx hack, their third! Their contracts were audited by Peckshield and Certik, both well respected auditors in their own right, and they still had a critical bug that allowed anyone to drain funds. We should not be underestimating the fallout of smart contract risk just because we haven\u2019t had any incident thus far. To that end, I\u2019m highly skeptical of having a high debt ceiling for TUSD like our approach with the USDC and PAX debt ceilings. I would much rather sandbox TUSD with a lower debt ceiling like we\u2019ve done with USDT to account for the extra risk and then raise it over time. Out of the current polling options, I would advocate for a 10M debt ceiling, Oracle price fixed at 1, with no liquidations and SF at 6%.   ",

                    "content": "If we are going to have Friday\u2019s executive for 101% LR on USDC and PAX I think we should approach DC increase for each stablecoin (USDC, PAX, TUSD) with a strategy to diversify Maker\u2019s stablecoin exposure. Most likely people will arb the price by minting DAI mostly on USDC until DC is hit. But once DC is hit, they will be forced to use PAX or TUSD to make profit, no matter what. We can basically set MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin exposure in advance by setting DC for each. Why I think this is important is because there potentially won\u2019t be another possibility to diversify stablecoin exposure for some time. Ideally you would want to diversify at least among three of them, but we would then soon need to assess the risks of a much higher DC on TUSD on Friday (and same 101% LR / 2% SF), associated with Nik\u2019s comment.

Many people think this is reasonable, but I think it is unreasonable. ETH shall not exceed 50% of DAI mortgage assets.   You can\u2019t simplify it so much, since collateral have different risk premiums. While in the longer term, i agree with your premise, i strongly disagree short term. One of the problems is ofc to set eth RP, imo especially because of migration to eth 2.0. ",

                    "content": "Looking at DEX liquidity I estimate that around 150m DAI would need to be minted to arb versus USDC, USDT and TUSD to push the price down to $1.01 (assuming 101% LR vote on Friday is realistic and this is already our target in regards to DC increase). There\u2019s additional demand on CEX and other pairs, so the final figure may be potentially around $250m DAI? The 133m DAI that is currently in SAFE/DAI pool on balancer will be probably released back when farming stops end of this week. But I think we just learnt we always want to have 100m-200m buffer available to defend against these farms that can pop up out of nowhere. What I also think is that we shouldn\u2019t be really constraining ourselves or being fooled that doing a smaller rather than larger increase of DC for stablecoins makes Maker any more safer at this point. Also, if speculators and arbitrageurs believe that 101% LR on Friday is realistic, they will already start shorting DAI this week until DC is reached. So we can either increase DC already now by 300m to accommodate for Friday\u2019s potential 101% LR outcome if we want to pursue that strategy. Or make a \u201csmaller\u201d increase (100m?) so that we make sure DAI price doesn\u2019t go up from here and then do the real one on Friday, when we\u2019ll have more information on the potential 101% LR. The other issue is we don\u2019t know how much more DAI goes into SAFE farming. And then we also need to decide, whether we want more exposure towards PAX and TUSD by having same parameters and limiting USDC DC to some number so we force people to mint on other stablecoins. I think this would be great but not sure how feasible it is, assuming that current DAI from SAFE will be returned, USDC DC will be released and people will prefer it versus PAX and TUSD. ",

While we don\u2019t have big name exchanges behind us like some other stablecoins, here at TUSD we\u2019ve made tangible investments in trust and transparency exceeding other fiat-backed stablecoins.   Transparency: TUSD is the only fiat-backed stablecoin to ever have 24/7 real-time 3rd-party attestations. These come from top US accounting firm Armanino.  To take transparency to an even higher level, we\u2019re now working with Chainlink Oracles to put this collateralization data on-chain for use by protocols such as Maker.     Trust: as mentioned above, TUSD has significant DeFi adoption and has the highest DeFi Score of any stablecoin listed on AAVE, higher than both USDC and USDT (PAX is not listed)   Access: TUSD is widely available through both 1st party and 3rd party fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, creating a new entry point for both individual and institutional Maker users. You can mint and redeem it right here.   Diverse collateral types from just one issuer: in addition to TUSD, we bring to the table 4 other trustworthy, real-time attested currencies: TrueAUD, TrueCAD, TrueGBP, and TrueHKD. This allows the maker system to diversify across multiple currencies while only taking on the risk of a single issuer. TrustToken is the only issuer that can offer this. image1343\u00d71172 345 KB   If folks still have concerns about TUSD as a collateral type, please let me and my team know so we can work with you to address them.

I\u2019m frustrated that this proposal only polls on DC, not RP or CR (binary choice only). Should poll for all 3, with minimallly biased ranges.   The main goal of this signal request was whether we wanted to modify the RIsk Parameters to be more in line with USDC-A and PAX-A. My opinion regarding the CR was that the on-chain governance poll holds more weight than a signal request. Better to use that for our signal. I think voting on RP would be a bit of a distraction. Mainly semantics why it should be different than USDC-A and PAX-A. Could always start a signal request to change the RP of TUSD-A and go through the normal weekly cycle. ",

I\u2019m going to add a counter-point we should consider. Since we want to be more aggressive about collateral on-boarding. How risky is this? What does an implementation upgrade in the future look like?  If you think about it, it will look just like this. They give us early access to the contracts, smart contracts domain team reviews it, MakerDAO approves the new interface for the join adapter, then they make the new implementation live. This is the process for the least amount of disruption to our TUSD users and liquidators. Notice that this process looks exactly like the situation today. We reviewed the implementation ahead of time, MakerDAO approved the implementation addition, and it will just instantly go live once that spell executes rather than when they upgrade. What\u2019s more.  We never added such an implementation check for USDC, as we had not thought of it yet.  Furthermore, we were unable to add the check for PAXUSD as that variable was private scoped.  While I support the implementation check, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the TUSD team, who have been extremely accommodating to our requests, start to feel as though they are being arbitrarily and unfairly treated. Let\u2019s say they decide to upgrade six months from now and have a 100 million DC, after they jump through all our hoops, we still have the risk that an upgrade is extremely bad.  The implementation check solves a particular set of risks for us, but we are no worse off than if PAXUSD or USDC do the same thing. ",

Since this new implementation is brand new, I think it would be wise to start with at most a $10M debt ceiling.

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  It also just seems like a really bad idea to even set the ceiling to 10M on a contract that has only been live for 48 hours.       Jiecut:  One thing to note, the smart contract team reviewed the upcoming TUSD implementation 2 weeks ago.   @LongForWisdom and others- we\u2019ve aimed to give you (and other integrators) as much time as possible to review the new contract and approve it before performing the upgrade. We didn\u2019t know this emergency vote was coming, and so we planned on several weeks between delivering the code to you for review and actually doing the upgrade. Things don\u2019t always go as planned and we\u2019re ready to roll with the punches! Given the situation, I think the best thing for us to do is upgrade as quickly as possible, which would be later today. This is not at all rushing code into production- this code has already passed an external audit as well as been reviewed by both the Maker and AAVE teams. For next time, we\u2019ll figure out how to make the process smoother.     SebVentures:  USDC contract can change tomorrow without any warning. TUSD is working with us and gives us the time to review before putting in prod. What is better?       cmooney:  We never added such an implementation check for USDC, as we had not thought of it yet. Furthermore, we were unable to add the check for PAXUSD as that variable was private scoped. While I support the implementation check, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the TUSD team, who have been extremely accommodating to our requests, start to feel as though they are being arbitrarily and unfairly treated.   We\u2019ve (fairly) gotten a lot of shit for a serious mistake that we made: one time recently when we upgraded TUSD without telling integrators such as Maker. We messed up and are 100% responsible. It was unintentional and I hope our behavior since then has made it clear how we intend on operating going forward. But I think it is worth noting that the transparency of our product, from our 24/7 real-time attestations to how our smart contracts are written, is part of what makes mistakes of this kind so glaring. As an example, I just went ahead and took screenshots of the stablecoins that have been discussed in this thread: USDC\u2019s proxy on Etherscan\u2019s Read Contract Feature: image1472\u00d71783 625 KB PAX\u2019s proxy on Etherscan\u2019s Read Contract Feature: image1486\u00d71903 746 KB TUSD\u2019s proxy on Etherscan\u2019s Read Contract Feature: image1516\u00d72233 991 KB No this is not just one example, it goes all the way up and down the stack. You can click on the ProxyOwner and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s just as transparent. It is in turn owned by a Gnosis Multisig. If one of our banking partners were to make a $1 mistake you might see the real-time attestation dashboard in a \u201cripcord pulled\u201d state (yes this happens sometimes, and yes it\u2019s embarrassing, but that\u2019s how transparency works). We\u2019re now working on putting the collateralization information from that dashboard on chain with Chainlink oracles. Once that\u2019s ready, protocols such as maker can choose to have tripwires not just on implementation upgrades or ownership changes but actual collateralization thresholds. Yes this in some sense disadvantages us compared with other stablecoins where you just can\u2019t tripwire on this stuff, but once again, that\u2019s how transparency works. No we don\u2019t have the brand or capital of a big exchange like USDC does, but I think we\u2019ve built a damn good product that gives every other stablecoin a run for its money. Conclusion: I am voting in favor of a 50M DAI DC. There\u2019s a lot our projects can do together and it\u2019s time we get started. ",

The Executive passed, and the following changes to the TUSD-A risk parameters modifications were put into effect. CR: 101% DC: 50M DAI RP: 4% This has been a great for enforcing the $1.01 cap on DAI and also diversifying MakerDAOs stablecoin exposure. ",

[Signal Request] Should we increase stablecoin DC and diversify exposure? Governance       Hey all,  Unutilized debt ceiling on stablecoins currently amounts to 90m (100m including USDT). DAI price seems to be more or less fixed around $1.01, but we shouldn\u2019t underestimate new DAI demand from upcoming farms in the next few weeks. We learnt the lesson with SAFE when more than 170m DAI was drained out of liquidity venues in only a few days. We would also want to have an additional stablecoin debt ceiling buffer always ready that provides liquidity in an event of unwinding ETH and WBTC v\u2026     ",
