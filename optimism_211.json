                    "content": "Committee Proposal  Committee Category: DeFi Committee Our focus is on making the proposal process straightforward for DeFi projects by providing a clear framework and support along the way. Our approach of engaging with proposers, performing solid due diligence & sharing qualified assessments, should help proposers make stronger proposals, facilitate decision-making for other delegates and strengthen the Op ecosystem. We consider all kinds of DeFi applications and liquidity mining schemes to fall under this category. Example proposals that would fall under this category:  Perpetual Protocol: (Liquidity, Building) [GF: Phase 0 Proposal] Perpetual Protocol - #7 by tiandao.eth  Paraswap: (Liquidity, Building) [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] ParaSwap  Liquity: (Liquidity, Borrowing, Bridging, Building) [DRAFT] [GF: Phase 1] Liquity   We are interested in making the proposal flow straightforward and offer to be the go-to committee for DeFi proposals. We look forward to collaborating closely with the 2nd DeFi committee to share a similar assessment framework & offer proposers a similar experience. So far, most proposals do not differ fundamentally as they include liquidity mining, builder and ecosystem incentives. Hence, we could split proposals in the following 3 simple ways  Alphabetical: (A-M, N-Z; tbd) In alternating order (A, B, A, B; tbd) Small-size vs. large-size ( A < 450K Op < B; tbd)  In the future, we look forward to more active proposal guidance to achieve lasting Op ecosystem growth. This could benefit from committee expertise in different DeFi areas. tbd  Committee 1: Derivatives, Trading, Liquidity & Asset management Committee 2: Lending, Stables, DEXs, Aggreagtors   Proposed number of committee members 5  Who will be the committee lead? @OPUser:- Bio  Summary - 449 comments / 4 days read time on I from a Tradi-fi background, started as a developer and now working as a PM mostly focusing on consulting and slowly moving into web3 space, mostly active on this gov forum and our gov-general channel on our Discord. Apart from this, I have contributed to two projects on Optimism, I was alpha tester of Lyra platform and the second project is Layer2DAO where I participated at the initial step of their Phase 0 proposal. Finally, I like my cute bunny pfp. Optimistic Bunnies are the very first NFT project on the OP chain and I do hangout in their discord from time to time.   Who will be the committee reviewers?(please link to bio and explain their involvement in Optimism to date)   @SEED_LATAM_Joxes:- Bio    Summary - 69 comments made / 1 day read time on governance forum My background is engineering and materials but interested in cryptocurrencies and Ethereum in 2017 since hyperinflation came to my country. Since then I have been active in various blockchain communities as a user. Since 2021 I\u2019m part of DeFi LATAM (first as a member, then as part of the team), a top latam community focused on Web3 for education and adoption purposes, providing a platform with high quality content and research on blockchains, DeFi, scalability. Since months ago I have also led a new community called \u2018L2 en Espa\u00f1ol\u2019 to study and educate everything that has to do with Ethereum scaling solutions. I also help the initiative called Optimism Espa\u00f1ol to push the adoption of this solution to the region and I have a role as part of the Polygon Advocate Program. Last but not least as delegate I\u2019m not working alone, we are currently exploring the sum of contributors in shared representation of the DeFi LATAM community and others in the region alongside honorable contributors with dedicated channels, governance calls and more, so you can also see how we work collectively for decision-making and participation in different instances.    @MinimalGravitas:- Bio    Summary - 103 comments made / 1 day read time on governance forum I come from a background in physics but have been interested and active in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2016, though as a user not a builder. I\u2019ve been an active participant in the online Ethereum community r/ethfinance, which gave me the confidence in my knowledge of the space to become a delegate for Optimism. Over the first season, each of us in this committee have been among the most active participants in the governance discussions and proposal reviews. This is shown in the forum data, for example with two of us having reached Trust Level 3 (Regular badge on Optimism Collective).    @Dhannte:- Bio    Summary - 37 comments made / 12h read time on governance forum I come from game design and architecture (construction and real state) with the pandemics I switched into crypto and since then I coordinate EthernautDAO where we bridge web2 senior devs to web3. My background in game design helps me understand tokenomics, usability, design, narrative and some code while construction taught me how to coordinate big projects with lots of people. I\u2019ve been an active user and preacher of Optimism as it is the only L2 using ETH as their gas token which is in my opinion the best way to provide value to the mainnet. We deployed all our smart contracts from EthernautDAO in optimism since we started and I have good relations with some of their devs (they are all good mentors).    @ScaleWeb3: Bio    Summary - 56 comments / 19h read time on gov forum I, Julian Richter, have an academic background in finance & entrepreneurship. After studies & working for tech startups such as Hellofresh & Flixbus, I founded my first company and went full-time into Web3 in early 2018. Since then, I\u2019ve led partnerships for NEM blockchain in the EU (2018), engaged in blockchain consulting (2019), launched blockchain-comparison.com (2020) to make crypto more accessible. In 2022, I\u2019ve founded ScaleWeb3 to elevate the top crypto ecosystems (l1s, l2s, Web3 & DeFi projects) more hands-on with ecosystem building, governance, product input - leveraging existing crypto & DeFi knowhow and quality distribution channels - and building new apps & tools for users, investors & projects. Optimism is a top l2, we\u2019ve been very active throughout the first governance phase, joined the workshop in Paris, and we look forward to support the ecosystem a lot more going forward.  Couple of proposals and ideas (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ) were submitted by the committee members during season 1, many of them received good feedback from the community and few of our recommendations were accepted by the Optimism Foundation which we really appreciate. Please provide the voting participation rate and % of votable supply held by each committee member:   @OPUser -Boardroom profile - 100% participation - 0.53% of votable supply   @SEED_LATAM_Joxes - Boardroom Profile- 100% participation - 0.60% of votable supply   @MinimalGravitas - Boardroom Profile 100% participation - 0.62% of votable supply   @Dhannte - Boardroom Profile 100% participation - 0.41% of votable supply   @ScaleWeb3 - Delegate Thread feedback on all 4 voting cycles, voting participation only in first 2 cycles due to l1 multisig issue some delegates experienced. Redelegate scaleweb3.eth \u2192 superdelegate.eth! - 0.3% of votable supply still in scaleweb3.eth    Please disclose any and all conflicts of interest committee members may have:   @MinimalGravitas - RocketPool Node Operator, abstained from RocketPool proposal (both discussion and voting), will abstain from any future proposals regarding RocketPool.   @Dhannte - EthernautDAO, I\u2019ll abstain from any future proposals regarding EthernautDAO   @ScaleWeb3 - We\u2019ll abstain from any future proposals regarding ScaleWeb3.   If additional conflicts of interest occur in the future we will abstain from votes and declare the potential bias in any relevant discussion.  Please link to the voting history (with rationale) of each committee member: Voting history can be verified for each committee member on Snapshot and voting rationale is mentioned in either their communication thread or on cycle closing thread.  @OPUser - Snapshot Profile  , Communication Thread @SEED_LATAM_Joxes - Snapshot Profile , Communication Thread @MinimalGravitas - Snapshot Profile ,no central delegate communication thread, example analysis from voting cycle 1 roundup: https://gov.optimism.io/t/voting-cycle-1-roundup/2619/34?u=@MinimalGravitas  @Dhannte - Snapshot Profile ,no central delegate communication thread, I do explain my logic here: https://twitter.com/@DhannteG/status/1543593278695677952 @ScaleWeb3 - Communication thread, Introduced a basic assessment framework during voting cycle 2 which consisted of value-add, reasonability of amount requested, quality of Op distribution and applicability of co-inventives (more extensive framework below)  It\u2019s important to note that our voting power is relatively low, which far from being a disadvantage represents a valuable attribute as genuine contributing members of governance while maintaining neutrality or de-risk of centralization of opinion or influence. In our position, our expected performance and commitment are backed by our past actions and activity and our commitment to continue over time.  Please outline the decision making framework the committee plans to use to make recommendations: Our decision-making framework can be seen in the following table. Some of the categories slightly overlap and decisions will likely never be fully quantifiable but we look forward to utilising the framework, making fair recommendations and offering other delegates good insights when making their own decision whether to follow our recommendation or not  1600\u00d7807 327 KB  Any other points not specified in the table that are circumstantially relevant will be duly addressed and noted in the report. This will depend on the particularities of each proposal. As the committee accompanies proposers through the proposal process, proposal quality should rise. It should be clear when proposals are ready to get committee approval. Nonetheless, projects decide whenever they wish to move from \u201cDraft\u201d to \u201cReady\u201d and we offer our recommendation in the forum.  Please describe how the committee will operate: The committee will pick one lead reviewer per proposal but all committee members should engage in each proposal. The committee will collaboratively assess the proposal and give one recommendation in the forum. Currently planned workflow, communication channels and expected outputs are detailed below:  For us, open communication and transparency is important as can be seen in our season 1 voting. Our committee will continue this approach as we believe that it\u2019s one of the important pillars of sustainable DAO Gov. We will have one \u201cprivate\u201d Discord channel for this committee to discuss internal processes, organisational improvements and launch of new proposal reviews. Our committee will offer proposers a point of contact and open a Discord channel on the Optimism Discord Server that is readable for other users to give continuous feedback to the team responsible for the proposal. Once the project wants to go from \u201cDraft\u201d to \u201cReady\u201d, we will offer an official feedback within 3 days and share our formal recommendation according to our framework on the gov forum below the proposal and in our Committee thread. At the end of each cycle, we will share our learning on the gov forum and at the end of season 2, we will share a report which will include season feedback and recommendation for next season.  This offers extensive support to proposers, insights to committee-proposal discussions as well as a public track record for accountability of committee and members. ",

It surely makes sense for the group of delegates with the highest demonstrated participation in assessment of proposals for season one to take responsibility for a largest section of proposals for season two!   I don\u2019t see any particular defi expertise represented here   The other way to look at that is that we don\u2019t have as many potential conflicts of interest as may arise from teams with members that work for their own DeFi projects. If you consider assessing competitors proposals as well as dApps that interact with a delegates\u2019 projects as possible conflicts of interest then I would have thought for the most credible neutrality we want delegates who are experienced DeFi users more than those who work in DeFi themselves.

I recommend refocusing on what this group has shown expertise at and considering another specialization. judging from your backgrounds i could see, for instance, metagovernance tools or broader community-oriented public goods, such as data providers or engagement programs, some of which I know firsthand are planning to submit for proposals.

I think one DeFi committee should be constituted by experts in the field yes. But having their own DeFi protocols makes it a huge conflict of interest and the second committee should be from outside any DeFi protocols running on optimism or mainnet. There\u2019s no guarantee you will approve any competitor from velo. It\u2019s also worth mention you are engaging here saying this committee is a bad idea because we are not professionals, but when you were asked to disclose Velo code and make it open source you said no, so how can we know you are an expert if we can\u2019t review the code, the whole idea of the crypto space is not to trust a human yet here you are saying \u201ctrust me but not this committee\u201d who has been 100% open. In the future constructive feedback is more useful than just saying what you think is wrong, keep it in mind for future project you will have to review. If you think we are not DeFi qualified then ask DeFi questions you think we don\u2019t understand and you\u2019ll get your answers. I\u2019m a heavy DeFi user since the beginning of it, I\u2019ve been part of many VC research groups and hedge research group yet this is outside my background because it\u2019s not my main job, just a math hobby for me.

In the meantime i don\u2019t see anyone here complaining about lito coen, kris caczor, or other protocol affiliates forming a tooling committee. as for my own case, i would be only one person on my committee, so i\u2019m not sure how i could be flagrantly self-serving in a group with others known to OP. I was asked to join because others - who in many cases have argued against me! - thought i brought a useful perspective. i\u2019ve weighed in exhaustively on other proposals - please feel free to surface an instance where i\u2019ve done anything other than speak my conscience. if i had to abstain from anything that velodrome touches, i wouldn\u2019t be able to weigh in on anything. we\u2019re a dex. we\u2019re central to defi on Optimism. Not sure where you get your news but velo code is open source (and always was exposed on etherscan from day one). repos, audit docs, and everything right here:  Security \u2013 Velodrome Finance. let\u2019s try to keep this conversation truthful and relevant  In the future constructive feedback is more useful than just saying what you think is wrong, keep it in mind for future project you will have to review.  Members of your own group conceded that DeFi expertise wasn\u2019t your key selling point, it was your level of activity. That\u2019s great. I made a suggestion to be a committee for another vertical more aligned with your backgrounds. i\u2019m not really sure how i could possibly be more constructive. I love EthernautDAO. Was talking about it yesterday with a colleague and wanted to see about engaging you all. What you do is great, and there are many ways outside defi your particular expertise can be brought to bear. tooling, community, devrel, infra would all benefit from your perspective. Our jobs here are to help Optimism thrive and win \u2013 that might not necessarily come in the ways we expect. i recommend you take my suggestion productively and reconsider your position. ",

Both are things I do not like to see when engaging with proposals and I would ask you to stop once more. The aggressive, unconstructive approach demonstrated is the exact behavior from \u201cecosystem thought leaders\u201c that will be mirrored by communities and ultimately turn off quality contributors. Re: Defi expertise, importance of building new things & committee fit. Let me simply summarize your Velodrome Finance project Project itself  It\u2019s a copy paste project: you forked Solidly ve(3;3) with all its complexities DEX should be for most efficient trading, it should not be about  amassing large amounts of liquidity (Unnecessary Total Value at Risk for Velo investors & the Optimism protocol which gains less from ineffective TVL(!) than it risks today)  adding 3 layers of complexity with voting & (manual!) bribing which takes 50%(!) of the fees from LPs (LPs take IL risk, others receive money?!)    Obscure token economic & governance model  Velo\u2019s initial token distribution has been a disaster and made it really hard for Optimism investors. Due to the setup, the only way the project will be successful is when Optimism sponsors incentives such as liquidity mining and trading incentives. Your implementation of Solidly is even more obscure than the original and will likely lead to an unneccessary redistribution of wealth from unsophisticated investors to insiders (Red Flag) and many investors are at risk of loosing a lot of funds through \u201cwrong positioning\u201c in the money game, an exploit of the large TVL, dilution or LPing. Running a ve token model offers some long-termism and creates some token sink but it makes little sense for projects without serious revenues. (hence, also not interesting for Convex-style ecosystem projects)  Having a non-aligned set of holders (for example other protocols & whales) decide on revenue distribution for pools is a pretty bad idea for the project as the most important pools get less bribes than they should (Ask @Solarcurve, Balancer will need to change this; at least pre-select pools & allow only small parameter changes)     Your involvement in Optimism  You asked for an incredibly high amount of OP tokens (3M!) as a microcap (Red flag) You received a large amount of Op tokens from Op foundation \u2013 even though you had already a completely messed up token distribution & incentive design for new investors on Optimism (why?!)  Due to Op incentives, you were able to grow TVL & veVelo  Your team engages in bad faith when talking to potential competitors (2x afaik)  Aggressive Curve response across channels (whose veModel is the basis of your project) This thread   Your team member steals funds in public (very bad look on judgement) - props on quick solution! Little quality governance involvement in Optimism until today  Is Solidly bad?  Solidly optimizes token sinks & long-term alignment when implemented well Solidly can bootstrap growth The Solidly/bribing model requires smart parameter choice, risk management & well-aligned partner protocols, then it can lead to flywheel for a quality ecosystem (Revenues are needed!)  Token economics & incentive design should not be mixed up with efficiency of a DEX protocol  Conclusion: Instead of making random claims and swings at valuable contributors to Optimism, I\u2019d recommend  improving Solidly (soon 1 B AUM \u2013 a nice hacking prize pool!)  acting in good faith in the Op ecosystem as you should be eternally grateful to Daddy Optimism helping the Op ecosystem grow by onboarding & welcoming stakeholders  @ all other delegates and community members  Feel free to ask us any questions regarding the proposal, our expertise or whatever interests you and is relevant to pick a committee. I encourage you to take an active stance when seeing bad faith actors as that costs a lot of energy and will result in us & others not contributing anymore to the ecosystem  (\u2013> Code of Conduct)  Enjoy the weekend, stay optimistic   ",

Meanwhile:    Introducing Governance Committees   Problems to Solve We heard lots of feedback from community members and delegates throughout Season 1. Committees attempt to solve the following problems: 1. Information Overload for Delegates There are currently a lot of proposals to be voted on by Token House delegates. Even for delegates that are very familiar with the context of these proposals and their applications, processing all these proposals is unsustainable. Providing feedback on proposal drafts and engaging on forum posts, while voting on active proposals, is currently an unmanageable workload for many delegates. 2. Purpose Mismatch for Delegates Delegates have different areas of specialty. While the majority of proposals to date have been related to DeFi, some delegates specialize in non-DeFi related topics such as public goods, tooling, and L2 infrastructure. These delegates don\u2019t feel well-equipped to vote on DeFi proposals or aren\u2019t interested in doing so.   Diminishing people capacity, expertise, ability to work in a specific committee was completely pointless in the first place. I didn\u2019t need to read all this BS but thanks. Now I know I don\u2019t want to be part of this kind of DAO. ",

I am highly aligned with MinimalGravitas, whose beliefs on climate change, for instance, are in lockstep with my own. I think they are a towering, valuable influence on OP. I\u2019ve looked in this thread and in the delegate commitment section and found not one mention of DeFi in their background. OPUser\u2019s claim to DeFi knowledge was being an alpha tester of Lyra. I\u2019m not saying these people shouldn\u2019t weigh in at all - but where\u2019s the actual argument for being specifically on the DeFi committee? Rather, members have highlighted backgrounds in gaming (unaddressed vertical), devrel (infrastructure, also unaddressed), and advocacy & education (community, also wide open). I think it\u2019d be great for these members to apply their expertise to proposals in these domains, of which there are already many. This is not a zero-sum situation.

But its all good, its a nature of DAO Gov, beauty of chaotic co-ordination and it will pass too. We had a chat in past on committee and you know where I stand on this, it has some cons but now with the committee guideline we all need to put the recommendation in written form which might be a biggest advantage so far as it can help counter biases. I wrote all this because I think you are an active member of this gov from start and we need your contribution, good thing is that our gov is working on iteration and foundation is serious about it so my request to you would be to consider this statement if you were serious about it. If we mess something up, we can fix it in the next iteration but only with your contribution.     Prometheus:  Now I know I don\u2019t want to be part of this kind of DAO.   ",

Governance is an iterative process, and progressive decentralization is the right path to take. That said, it needs to be clear what communities and delegates can decide and what is ultimately decided by core teams. Core teams like Optimism should make most decisions and even have veto rights at this stage. Nonetheless, contributors should have a say over defined parts and be able to meaningfully add value - otherwise I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that there are better ways to spend your time. Ultimate goal should be minimalistic governance for key protocols such as Ethereum & Optimism - that we genuinely like, want to support and strengthen. I\u2019ll just ignore your passive, aggressive tone though I must say the last week made me reconsider whether I + my companies should even support Optimism from here on out  ",

It seems we have different opinions on \u201crage quitting\u201d, \u201cgood natured manner\u201d, \u201cgovernance\u201d. Many in crypto still do not understand what community and governance means. Here\u2019s our take:  1000 random people are not \u201cthe community\u201d, neither are \u201conly\u201d token holders or Discord members. Finding 10 quality contributing companies, 50 valuable stakeholders and 100 motivated, smart individuals is something not many projects have ever achieved in crypto. You need core devs, subject experts, groups that take on tasks (subDAO, metaDAO, xyz). Discussing with random people on the internet may be the job of a community manager in Discord but it is not part of this committee position. Its job is assessing DeFi projects, and we additionally offered helping projects craft the best possible proposals for their own project and Optimism.  Before optimizing for further growth & decentralization to \u201ccommunity\u201d, you need these quality stakeholders. Otherwise, values & goals are lost, while discussing \u201cgovernance\u201d, \u201cvision\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d.  Who are the top 10 DeFi projects / teams that Optimism should onboard? Who are the top 20 community members so far with input to DeFi? Which of the DeFi projects (soon-to-be) on Optimism will offer strong, lasting network effects? Who has demonstrated a reasonable path between (TVL) growth and security? What are the DeFi projects that make sense on Optimism but not on Ethereum mainnet or a Starkware implementation?    After all, I\u2019ve been part of too many crypto communities to spend my time making anons happy. I prefer thinking about DeFi or here: discussing it in the context of Optimism. Would be happy to hear your thoughts on the posted questions. Cheers ",

Let me demonstrate\u2026 Most people exaggerate their experience in the web3 space Here is the entirety of information on Optimism from blockchain-comparison.com; yes, it is a single line in an AirTable.

I think it\u2019s important to share some real evidence of experience and a little more transparency, you mention your companies; are you the sole owner? Where are they incorporated?

In this case, your group would be Group C  The thought is that this should prevent confusion about the multiple defi committees heading into Voting Cycle #5.

You\u2019re going round systematically telling everyone who\u2019s voted for us that they should abstain or whatever. In discord you\u2019re telling Polynya they shouldn\u2019t vote because they represent too many delegators. Now you\u2019re saying Lefteris and Kris shouldn\u2019t vote for us because the DeFi LatAm team have a representative in Tooling as well as our DeFi committee\u2026 and at the same time in Discord you\u2019re claiming that delegates should be able to vote for themselves. Obviously you\u2019ve realized that if you can convince everyone that voted for us and not for you to abstain, and at the same time allow your team to vote for their own proposal rather than abstain then you will win\u2026 but by doing so you\u2019re coming across as being pretty underhanded and devious, which isn\u2019t going to make you look good in the eyes of other delegates. The hypercompetitive, win-at-all costs thing is pretty grim. The fact that your team are constantly in this thread putting us down and arguing with anyone who offers us their support just doesn\u2019t seem very Optimistic. It reminds me of the time soon after the airdrop when in Discord several delegates were trying to drum up support by stating their visions and posting links to their \u2018commitments\u2019, some of those links would immediately receive poo emojis from a bunch of sockpuppet accounts. I don\u2019t think I ever posted my link there, as my Ethereum community is predominantly Reddit based and I didn\u2019t think it made sense to try and get support from people who didn\u2019t know me\u2026 however I did watch closely how the process went down and kept some records of it, as outside of crypto one of my other big interests is understanding and resisting disinformation and manipulation online (here\u2019s an article featuring my efforts in that field: Meet the Redditors fighting 2020's fake news war). I wonder if you remember that and perhaps can see some parallels with the negative vibes that this committee selection process seems to be bringing out? If so then hopefully you might try a more positive approach to encourage more support. In the end, even if you don\u2019t get selected, you are still free to vote as you like on grant proposals and ignore the recommendation of committees that you don\u2019t agree with, especially if you can share good reasons why the decision is in error or is missing some insight. Not \u2018winning\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean you lose any ability to participate. ",

It\u2019s an expression of disappointment at how groups have been constructed and an effort to make this structure actually work.

I\u2019ve already seen how members of this group have handled proposals. Good proposals will die due to a lack of fundamental defi understanding. Good builders will get stymied in questions about process and confused by incoherent, inconsistent demands on defi-related matters. Projects looking at a (growing!) menu of incentive programs across ecosystems will dismiss Optimism as an impossible case. ",

                    "content": "Hi @MoneyManDoug, I was trying to avoid this political debate, wasting each others time without a proper goal in sight. But I believe you are taking this too far and I need to address few of your concern.  It seems to me that they would only gain monetarily, as that\u2019s the only reason to put yourself on two committees  This is just sad that you think I am putting myself in more than two committee for this, I have no vested interest in Optimism and its true that I spend my significant amount of time here because I like our gov model, I see a working DAO with our two pillar gov model and I want to be a part of it. Anyone following my thoughts on committee knows that I was not in favor of this and because I was afraid that someone will come pointing finger and relating everything that the committee will do to money. This was one of the reason I suggested that instead of giving reward in form of money we should focus on different option. Better option was to put the committee in RPGF. Common problem with greed is that we underestimate it. Foundation decision to reward the delegate engagement was a good idea and decision to form committee does have some pro and cons which we should discuss at the end of Season 2. Circling back to your comment on mo, its your opinion and I cant do anything about it but to anyone reading this, its true that getting reward for time and contribution will be an added motivation but let me be clear on one thing, I was here when there was no talk about money and I will be here even if foundation choose to remove the money part from coming season. Looking back on Season 1, we have made some progress and there are scope of improvement, second pillar of Gov is expected to be active in upcoming month(s) and I am super excited about it. And now that I am thinking about it, I also want to mention that its true that there are many delegate in other committee who is more versed than me but I also believe that if we ask the right question at right place to right person and with a learning attitude, we can solve many problems which also include doing valuation of proposals. But even with my limited knowledge, I would encourage you to look into my past review and tell me where did I do wrong, do you find any instance which need improvement, was I biased or aligned in any form ? Was I selective in nature when doing valuation of proposal in the past? But you know what, Doug, I can say this about you. You did vote on almost all the proposal in the past but choose only to comment and interact with very few of them. Voting in dark is always a red flag in my book and this gives me less confidence in you. Now that I am part of committee, I want to make it clear that this is my opinion and I am not writing on behalf of my committee. But on that topic, I do believe that combined power of knowledge and interest that my committee can bring on table makes us a suitable candidate to be part of DeFi committee and  I was expecting support, in case I need some, from active members like you but I am not sure if I can expect that from you anymore. Rather than focusing on different way to contribute, you are more focused on making sure that my committee does not get final approval. May be you see us as a competition but I still disagree with your approach. Creating a separate thread and discussing it there would have been a much better approach.  enough bandwidth to handle all proposals  Forgive my french but are you suggesting that I wont have enough bandwidth to review the proposal ?  If yes, then I dont know how you can mention this ? Remember in Phase 1 we had close to 30 proposal, in season 1 we had more than 10, in some of them we had 15 How many proposals you expect we get per committee, 5 ? max 10 ? Those are rookie number my friend, given that now we have 3 week, I can review them alone, all of them and I will still have some time to learn new topic if a new proposal comes to my plate which is new and innovative. Just imagine what our committee can do, take some time and reflect on the bandwidth.  Coming back  to your two concern:-   Delegate Abstaining :- I believe that if I am part of a proposed committee, i should abstain . This is a best practice, I also believe by doing this we can avoid conflict and bias. There is no written rule on this so I am not gonna judge anyone not following this, if we see some major conflict because of this, we can discuss that too.   One user being part of more than one committee:- I have said that in the past, we can discuss this and depending on the consensus, the documentation can be amended to reflect the changes. But I am questioning your approach and how you choose to address this point.   I was planning of creating a thread on this forum during reflection session of Season 2 to address this topic but if you feel that this is quite critical and need urgent attention, my suggestion would be to create a thread and discuss it there rather that chasing us on this forum and on discord. Bring everyone to a thread dedicated to this topic and discuss it there, it will easy for all us to follow this topic, i can also put my view on this topic on one place rather than writing the same thing again and again on different channel.

Anyway, proposals should incentive usage, they aren\u2019t that technical, they shouldn\u2019t be very technical (they don\u2019t include code for instance) and as such they don\u2019t require a deep understanding of coding or whatever.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s not smart to have a two people decide the entire outcome of whose selected. This means committees are forever doomed, they will always be voted in/out based on the voice of 1 or two people given the abstaining rule. Not only did they receive two votes from related committee members they got Polynias vote which is already absurdly large. I see over 3.5m in votes that should be abstained imo. ",

There is a track record of this not having been the case, though I do respect the time you\u2019ve incorporated my suggestions, such as emphasizing OP as a pairing token, though even then that was applied haphazardly and without regard to routing considerations. A lack of defi knowledge will be a death by a thousand cuts, and the only thing i\u2019m left with at the end of all of this is that your group, despite this, essentially doubled down on defi just because you wanted it, not because you were the best to do it. Really feel bad for the protocols applying to Optimism if this group passes. I look forward to continuing to work with them off the books and hearing more of their complaints. ",
