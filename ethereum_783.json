                    "content": "Thanks for kickstarting this! Here are a few comments I had on the blog post.  Ethereum Governance  It [the EF] manages a number of pieces of community infrastructure and employs / contracts several teams working on major software for Ethereum, from testing frameworks to the Geth client.  I think it would be worth including research in this.  Ethereum is a set of protocols, from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that underlies the smart contract system and many core features, to the devp2p peer communications protocol, to the JSON-RPC middleware for getting data in and out of nodes.  It may be worth highlighting that some of these are specified in the Yellow Paper, but that others aren\u2019t. One of my biggest realizations when starting to work on a client was the amount of things that are not part of the YP.  Open Source Collaboration  although money of them are paid by the EF as employees or contractors  Typo  money \u2192 many  many of the core norms of open source are no longer being taught, even to developers. I think we can do more here, and would love to work on onboarding more new developers to become valuable developers to the core Ethereum stack, as well as the emerging ETH2 stack to build our next generation of experts.  Agreed. We spend a lot of time thinking of the pool of developers currently building on Ethereum or other blockchains, but the reality is that the set of developers who haven\u2019t contributed to this space is orders of magnitude larger and we don\u2019t do much, as a community, to pull them in.  Protocol Standards  I think the EIPs process works quite well, and is only improving. More education, especially for technically proficient developers who can add value to the network, would still be better.  Do you have any idea what this could look like?  There is a movement that is just beginning to have dedicated maintainers and repositories for different parts of the Ethereum stack \u2013 the EVM, devp2p, the JSON-RPC interface, and so on. This means that even more collaborators can work together, even beyond the boundaries of Ethereum main-net, to improve and be interoperable.  I think splitting up various parts of Ethereum into smaller groups, like mentioned here, is probably the way to go if we want to keep iterating rapidly, reaching rough consensus, and not have Core Devs be a bottleneck. Aside from purely technical issues, you can imagine dealing with mining/staking rewards, UX, etc.  Core Devs Coordination  Having spoken with individual client teams, the feedback is that code implementation really doesn\u2019t take a lot of time: forward progress is being limited by non-technical decisions making and roadmap arguments  today .  Well said!  Dan Finlay\u2019s process flow diagram  It seems like there is a connection missing between the \u201cUsers, dapps, any address [\u2026] or dependencies\u201d and \u201cClients implement hard fork patch\u201d which explains a lot of the issues that have currently surfaced. For example, Geth & Parity have already implemented ProgPow (although perhaps not the latest spec). This does not imply it will be bundled into a release and made available to the public, namely because of the signalling that is happening by users and dapps at the moment.  Network Governance  One point of view is that \u201cstakeholders should self organize\u201d.  One risk is that we keep fragmenting the conversation to a degree where it is impossible for people to have a global picture of what \u201cthe community\u201d is. Perhaps this is inevitable past a certain size, but we should push people towards existing tools vs. novelty.  I don\u2019t think placing network governance \u201cbefore\u201d protocol standards or Core Devs makes sense.  +1. I think what we are mostly missing is a step from Core Devs saying \u201cthis is technically sound\u201d to them saying \u201cso let\u2019s implement it in the next hard fork\u201d. There should be some other group(s) in between those steps that try and answer the \u201cis this what the majority of the community wants?\u201d question, especially in the case of less-technical issues. Perhaps the best way to do this is to create a new category or sub-category along with Core. You could imagine Core-networking, Core-economics, Core-mining, etc. with different stakeholders representing each sub-category. ",

I footnoted this already, but primary point of this post / framework is not what EF is responsible for / does, or what the community thinks it should do. That would be a very valuable exercise that to date, EF members & leaders have not wanted to have an open discussion about. I also don\u2019t mention EF grants for the same reason.     timbeiko:  One of my biggest realizations when starting to work on a client was the amount of things that are not part of the YP.   Right??? I think we\u2019re heading in a better direction, and with entities like the EEA and potentially other points of collaboration at the Protocol Standards level this can only get better.     timbeiko:  Do you have any idea what this could look like?   You and others learning the process. Me giving presentations at various in person events. Basically \u2013 whenever you see someone with good technical skills saying \u201cI wish it worked this way\u201d or \u201cwhat if Ethereum had this feature?\u201d \u2013 recruit them to try and write an EIP.

Yasssss. There is still a higher amount of coordination required here as teams would need to cross-collaborate, but I feel like the teams being largely \u201cpermission-less\u201d that there are enough \u201cwell-connected nodes\u201d (read: people with multiple interests) where communication is fairly efficient. Think of it as a human-based gossip protocol lol.     timbeiko:  One risk is that we keep fragmenting the conversation to a degree where it is impossible for people to have a global picture of what \u201cthe community\u201d is. Perhaps this is inevitable past a certain size, but we should push people towards existing tools vs. novelty.   I really think this is the core of our problems. The dispersion of communication among many parties is creating longer and longer feedback loops leading to poorer communication. It\u2019s like a bad game of telephone. Couple that with the fact that the majority of the community prefers social media channels with poor scaling properties for a large community, and you get what you get today: a lot of people talking past each other, instead of calm well-reasoned debate. Forums (like this one) are simple better, and can be tailor fit to our needs as a community.     timbeiko:  I think what we are mostly missing is a step from Core Devs saying \u201cthis is technically sound\u201d to them saying \u201cso let\u2019s implement it in the next hard fork\u201d.   I think this is the right take. It could maybe be in parallel. I think seeking technical consensus first is important, but that can be done offline of the All Core Devs call, which is really intended only to come to consensus on the proposals that are included in forks by all clients, or tracking their progress. I think in a properly oiled machine it should be more obvious that proposals have gone through their respective stakeholder processes (technical, economic, political, social, etc.) and are ready for the final work of implementation, which should not be a controversial decision. ACD should largely be seen just as \u201cimplementing the will of the community\u201d.     timbeiko:  Perhaps the best way to do this is to create a new category or sub-category along with Core.

I really want this proposal to make it into Istanbul:     EIP-1344: Add chain id opcode EIPs   https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1344 proposes to add an opcode to retrieve the chain id of the chain that the block has been mined on.  This would allow smart contract to validate signatures that use replay protection (as proposed in EIP-155).  Currently the only way is to hardcode the chain id into the smart contract. This poses a problem in case of a hardfork.  This opcode would allow multi signature contracts that use signatures to implement better replay protection and increase securit\u2026      It\u2019s fairly uncontroversial in my mind and also relatively simple with clear benefits (like Layer 2 message-signing), so it may make a really good walk-through EIP to show others how the process really works.

Fair enough, but given how poorly the \u201cconsult the community\u201d phase for ProgPow went, perhaps it would make sense to try and at least get feedback on this by Core Devs. I am not sure what the best mechanism to do so would be, especially since it is an old-ish PR.

So, up to people who want to make this change to hold a community call, get people interested in discussing, etc. Right now \u2013 I personally am a \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d. Meaning: I don\u2019t want to expend energy on changing this aspect of the EIP process, AND I don\u2019t think more people signing up to be Working Groups / Rings won\u2019t appear. I\u2019d prefer the energy to go into actually moving Core EIPs forward, AND having working groups / Rings around each of those areas. So an action to take might be to take the current list of proposed EIPs \u2192 https://en.ethereum.wiki/roadmap/istanbul \u2192 and indicate which areas of Ethereum expertise are needed. For example, my team is working on EIP615, and the Ring there is, I guess, the ETH1x Ring, the Security Ring, and maybe there should be a VM & Precompiles Ring that encompasses EVM, eWASM, and precompiles. Also: it would be good if this had it\u2019s own discuss thread, rather than layers of governance thread  ",
