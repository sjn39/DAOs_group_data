What Core Units does the DAO need next? Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling       This is my personal opinion and recommendation, but NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR the DAOs recommendation\u2013easiest way to onboard into DAI is by using CEXs like Coinbase, FTX, Binance, Kraken, Gemini (assuming they have inventory), etc. However, there\u2019s still a lot left to be desire when using DAI to buy a Pint   at a Sports Complex. Primarily because it can only be done by using a Debit Card like the Coinbase Debit Card that charges Fees out-the-wazoo, IMO.  As you know, there are other ways \u2026     ",

For example, to use a blockchain, you must have the currency of that blockchain pass it to a wallet and all that is many additional steps. @Saludiego_201 you are right about the part of using XDAI or gnosis chain, it is currently very cheap in commissions. I think you can buy with fiat very easily from Ramp Network, also this Dai on zync is another option. It is not something decentralized, but it gives you a faster experience than a traditional centralized exchange. ",
