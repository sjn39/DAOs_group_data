As oracles come with operational expenses, we are wasting money here. This collateral seems not be interesting for anyone to mint DAI - we could cut on those expenses if we would offboard YFI as a supported collateral.  Signal Request: Shall we offboard YFI?     No, let\u2019s keep YFI Yes, let\u2019s offboard YFI Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This Signal Request will run until 2022-10-20T22:00:00Z - its outcome will result in an onchain poll assuming there is majority for offboarding (ignoring abstaining votes). This is a conditional Signal Request: I will withdraw if at least 10 million DAI has been minted until closing. ",

However:  If the Compound D3M is implemented the DAI yVault might see an uptrend in yield, and that might encourage end-users to mint DAI.

It\u2019s a highly concentrated risk on a collateral that no longer has any organic demand. The fact that there was no human usage for the YFI-A clearly shows that. Yearn has a long history of empty promises, zero deliverables and overall bad market strategy that chased out both users and token holders. What happens if the vault becomes undercollateralized and needs to be liquidated? Most likely it will become bad debt as I don\u2019t see anyone wanting to buy that many YFI tokens, at least not at the prices that would cover the debt. I suggest that the YFI-A vault should be closed ASAP. I am open to have this revised if there is ever any organic demand for the YFI token in the future. ",
