The discussion was really interesting and some people volunteered to gather useful data. The debate was good for the community. He said he would get back to us, but he never came back. Somebody pinged him on Twitter like 2 weeks ago or so, he said he was sorry and that he would give an update. In reality he\u2019s been nothing but avoidant. In the meantime he\u2019s tweeting about crazy Sushi rewards\u2026   twitter.com    monetsupply.llc (MonetSupply)  lol  5:50 PM - 5 Feb 2021     21            If you delegated your votes to him, maybe it\u2019s time to undelegate. I\u2019m not saying we need to incentivize LPs at this point. I just want to highlight how unprofessional and childish his behavior has been. I really doubt he has any particular interest in Uniswap getting more market share. In fact I\u2019m not quite sure why he became a delegate in the first place. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, there is no \u201cdelegate pitch\u201d from him on this forum. ",

You\u2019re mistaken  Delegate to monet-supply I regret not following up on the liquidity incentive proposal for as long as I have, this was an oversight on my part. I\u2019ve just posted an update in the thread here: [Discussion] Uniswap Liquidity Incentive Plan - #227 by monet-supply In my defense, I\u2019ve been hard at work at 2 jobs that are substantially benefiting the Uniswap ecosystem in the meantime:  Helping build out withtally.com, a governance interface that offers deeper information on delegates and proposals than is available on uniswap.exchange/vote or Sybil  Completing risk assessments for MakerDAO to onboard Uniswap LPs - so far I\u2019ve processed 9 assets including the UNI/ETH pair  To just be brutally honest, I\u2019m choosing between participating in organizations/networks that value my contribution (socially and financially) vs a network where I volunteer my work and get roasted in return. I\u2019m 100% committed to Uniswap and contributing to UNI governance. But we need to do better at fostering a welcoming community that makes people want to participate. ",
