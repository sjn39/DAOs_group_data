                    "content": "  Virtual machine  Decide definitely doing EWASM (default)? What does the FFI look like? How is code serialized? Doing any fancy AST merklization?    Cross-shard message structure.  Here is a possible design with some details: https://ethresear.ch/t/phase-2-pre-spec-cross-shard-mechanics/4970  Mechanics: cross-shard messages, contract yanking Decide we\u2019re not doing layer 1 synchronous cross-shard calls and leaving it to layer 2 (default) or do something else?    Contract storage structure  Linear code, linear storage, max combined size 12kb (to fit a yank into a single block) ?    Contract addressing  Default approach: CREATE2 for everything Possible alternative: optional sequential addresses for contract creation (rationale: with much smaller addresses, using libraries may be much more efficient)    Access lists  Total (must specify all addresses) vs partial (can specify prefixes) vs none at all    Account abstraction model  https://ethresear.ch/t/tradeoffs-in-account-abstraction-proposals/263 https://ethresear.ch/t/maximally-simple-account-abstraction-without-gas-refunds/5007 Major tradeoff: do we abstract nonces or not? That is, do we keep in-protocol nonce-checking of transactions or do we leave that to the contract code?  Rationale for abstraction: simpler protocol; also prevents complexities arising from interaction between multiple users attempting withdrawal from one contract at the same time, where N-1 of them must resend with a higher nonce, also removes need to worry about replay prevention in the hibernation/waking cases in-protocol Rationale for non-abstraction: potential for more guarantees for network peers; preserves invariant that any given txhash appears only once in a chain      Gas cost model  Computation Data Access: charge per Merkle branch, don\u2019t charge if the Merkle branch has already been used in that block? Adopt fee market reform proposal from https://ethresear.ch/t/draft-position-paper-on-resource-pricing/2838 ?    Storage fees  https://ethresear.ch/t/a-minimal-state-execution-proposal/4445 https://ethresear.ch/t/state-fees-formerly-state-rent-pre-eip-proposal-version-3/4996 Hibernation and waking: https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-shard-receipt-and-hibernation-waking-anti-double-spending/4748 (referenced in https://ethresear.ch/t/phase-2-pre-spec-cross-shard-mechanics/4970) Decide on fixed fee?  Note: even with a fixed fee, there is an implied cap on the storage size of each shard because of gas limits (at least, this is if we charge a gas cost that scales linearly with TTL extension)      What is the above missing?
