Just this morning I saw that Uniswap had funded 1m UNI ($20m) to the extremely well known Defi Education Fund and I was incredibly inspired. Not only was I pleased that they were embracing the pseudonymous nature at the heart of crypto twitter (not even bothering to have a profile picture), but I was also touched by the 10m votes from the proposer to award themselves the grant money. That is the real defi I believe in. Voting to give yourself money.  image1098\u00d7834 71.4 KB  I have used this inspiration to create the following proposal. Proposal to allocate 500,000 UNI to create and fund the Cobie Headshave Fund (CHF) CHF is a heteronymous entity that represents my cranium and personal wallet. The proposal has not passed the temperature and consensus checks, but I think they are likely unnecessary steps due to the overwhelming support I received on Twitter. The CHF will fund the shaving of my own head, and potentially other heads. The funding will have the goals of 1) shave my head; 2) hire Ed Sheeran or Odell Beckham Jr or someone to operate the shaving clippers; 3) record the head shaving as proof of shave (PoS); 4) spurring other DeFi protocols to fund headshaving. The CHF entity will be nonpartisan and really only exists to facilitate acquiring this grant. The CHF will fund all of the following:  Shaving of my head Equipment required to shave my head such as clippers and one of those cape things because I don\u2019t want hair all over the house A celebrity to shave my head because it would be cool Camera equipment to record shaving of the head as proof that I am not simply trying to get free money without doing anything Male pattern baldness support groups Might buy some new sunglasses for Udi as well I will give like maybe a third of the money to the biggest \u201cyes\u201d voter or something so hit me up if you\u2019re a UNI whale  We propose the following as the initial committee members, with a subset of them serving as the entity\u2019s board of directors. All have expressed their willingness to join the committee:  Mark Cuban, playboy billionaire Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase and advocate for bald heads That guy who is trying to reorg ETH for money, I think he\u2019s called Eddie or something Bitfinexed and/or Chris Blec Kain Warwick of Synthetix (he agrees to everything) Will Smith from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air  We expect many members to serve pro bono and total compensation across the committee to be less than $150,000 annually. This entity will continue to request similar future grants for future headshavings if the first one is proven successful and as a big value add to UNI holders.

Marketing towards the mainstream is as of yet underexplored, this will prove a light-hearted way to get a lot more normies to use both Uniswap and learn of the powers of DeFi governance. It will expose them to our culture rather than just the tech. It\u2019ll generate hopes and dreams of passing similar proposals, building similar projects and generally \u201cmaking it\u201d in ways not possible in conventional organisations. Setting the story and the narrative are essentially the most important thing when immortalising ideas and trying to grow DeFi far beyond what any single organisational structure could achieve. The timing of this proposal is well-suited since Uniswap is being deployed on layer two solutions where fees go down and more users can be introduced and accomodated. Uniswap should strive the be the place where all these new users learn of DeFi, rather than a competitor. Lastly, Cobie probably has enough integrity to return the excess funds if this proposal indeed goes through. He has dark comedic appeal, which is relatable to normie audiences, and especially the kind of audiences who wish to break free from their traditional day jobs and lifestyle. ",

                    "content": "Obviously this proposal is satirical (and heartfelt apologies to those paid well enough to not be able to laugh), but in the wise words of popular philosopher J Cole \u201call good jokes contain true shit\u201d. It is probably worth reviewing why a joke became one of the top 5 most viewed Uniswap proposals ever. By the way, can anyone tell me how I progress this important proposal to on-chain voting so I can get my fucking money? Personally, I am relatively supportive of a lobbying group that is pro-defi. It is clear to me that often politicians are particularly poorly informed and it makes sense to me that an open industry should use any tools available to progress forwards. Whilst I think lobbying itself is anti-democratic, I believe \u201chating the player instead of the game\u201d is a misdirection of energy. I think $20m sending good actors that understand the realities of crypto to lobby directly is probably a pretty good use of money. I also think that the way the vote passed, the transparency around the proceedings and the level of rigour required to acquire $20,000,000 from a forum post were all significantly lacking what you would expect for a topic as controversial as this. It is clear this topic will remain controversial and there are a lot of extremely nuanced opposing views, but it is also important to highlight that it is a controversial topic that can impact DeFi industry-wide, and not just UNI token holders. Anyway, why is there a backlash? I think there\u2019s a series of factors that are prompting the joke to resonate. 1. Governance theatre It is difficult to avoid the prevalent feeling that there some \u201cgovernance theatre\u201d occurring, with DAO-shaped hoops simply jumped through to issue the wishes of large holders after discussions in closed-door environments. A range of factors contribute to this: 1) large delegates and ecosystem participants feel their feedback was not addressed or was outright ignored; 2) significant amount of voting share from the proposal proposer and related parties (something like 7 addresses responsible for huge amounts of pro-vote firepower) ; 3) lack of clarity around who the founders of this effort are creating a \u201cvote to give ourselves money\u201d narrative; 4) centralisation of supply making governance participation futile for many who feel their interests are being voted on without way to make their voice heard \u2013 snapshot vote would\u2019ve failed 4:1 without the 3 student groups voting; 5) significant lack of thoroughness or rigour in the proposal making $20m grant surprising, pushing people to believe in foul play and cronyism rather than irresponsibility with treasury.  1062\u00d71290 333 KB   763\u00d7602 25.2 KB  It is not unreasonable to suggest that decisions are not made by the community but instead by a handful of power brokers. Centralization often results in nepotism and a series of these factors offer the question: is this governance theatre to extract liquidity from the treasury? 2. Purpose of the Uniswap treasury There are a lot of questions around the purpose of the Uni treasury that have arisen from this grant. It is unsurprising that there are a lot of different views between UNI holders and it is difficult to ignore that the view being most well represented is the view from large centralised supply holders, mostly VCs, who will take cross-portfolio benefits from spending the Uniswap treasury\u2019s money on industry-wide lobbying. But do smaller UNI holders feel they were \u201cdumped on\u201d for something that perhaps doesn\u2019t directly benefit the UNI ecosystem? Do non-US based UNI holders have to do another proposal for reg lobbying in their own country? Would there be less backlash if such an effort was co-funded by a consortium of DAOs or crypto projects? Perhaps some structure and opinion to how the Uni treasury should be used would be useful to set expectations around what should and should not be funded. Is the Uni treasury for investing in the Uni ecosystem directly only, or is okay to generally fund vague proposals that you believe are probably well intentioned but require effectively dumping on the ecosystem for (fingers crossed) long term cross-industry benefits. 3. Level of rigour required to get $20,000,000 for nothing I believe there is an expectation that, in order to acquire twenty million dollars by posting on a forum, there should be a \u201cno stone left unturned\u201d approach and a general lack of vagueness. I guess in crypto many ecosystem participants harbour significant cynicism towards traditional finance and traditional government, and therefore (maybe unrealistically) expect a higher standard. Should it be possible that things like \u201cwhen will you sell the Uni we grant you?\u201d should be left to vague interpretations, or is it something that should be required info before you vote on the proposal?  1376\u00d7316 207 KB  Is how you sell important? Should that be specified in a proposal that requests $20m? Do you get to choose which OTC service you go with, can you go with your friend\u2019s OTC and earn him a commission? Should there be more information before a snapshot vote on who will be involved in this effort, who is securing the $20m grant?  1600\u00d7239 159 KB  Should there be transparency regarding who is backing the proposer, or top voters? Should the proposer even be allowed to vote on their own proposal? Should voters have an accurate overview on intended usage of the funds? Should there be any accountability back to UNI holders after the grant is issued? What mechanisms should be in place to ensure the entity acquiring the grant behave in ways that are aligned with the interests of UNI holders, or the Uniswap company? Maybe none? God forbid if I link to anything Chris Blec has ever written, but he did have (maybe for the first time ever) some actual good points that went without response or reply. Should there be responses to dissenters, as long as they are acting mostly in good faith? Or does it not matter as long as you get the votes you need to pass? What is the right level of analytical rigour required of a proposal to issue $20m from the treasury? It\u2019s obviously extremely difficult to answer, but I imagine the recent proceedings that left many with questions is not an example of what \u201cgood\u201d looks like. Which is a shame, because it was a decent opportunity to do things in a way that left everyone feeling aligned and informed. Nevermind. I would like to note that any additional vagueness makes proposals passing less believable in a world where you believe in responsible treasury management and therefore reinforces anyone believing in VC-backed cronyism. 4. Twitter account lol Honestly, if the Twitter account hadn\u2019t posted anything, I don\u2019t think anyone would really be talking about this much. But an incomplete profile with default profile picture posting it\u2019s second ever tweet to say \u201cwe dumped $10m of UNI, thanks\u201d is objectively quite a hilarious way for those that don\u2019t follow Uni governance to find out about this initiative for the first time. Additional unintentional comedy from the feedback-directed name change to Defi Education Fund, which I think is the correct decision, but looks like intentional doublespeak to people hearing about it for the first time when they find out it\u2019s a lobbying fund. I understand that the majority of crypto projects are terrible at comms so hard to be surprised. Bored now Anyway, I\u2019ve spent way too long writing about this now, but thought it was important to restore my reputation as a credible and important critical thinker and not just a lowest-common denominator comedian. It\u2019s a complex topic, one that will maybe lead to some better outcomes for our industry (and maybe not). It\u2019s hard not to imagine how much more well received a consortium-funded \u201cDefense Fund\u201d with superior transparency and cross-ecosystem buy-in may have been. But maybe how some idiots on Crypto Twitter feel about this thing is not important at all in the long run. Everyone has their own vested interests anyway. Decentralisation is perpetual war, after all. Where is my $10,000,000? Cobie ",

What can the average UNI token holder do to stop it? Pretty much nothing. Organized minority beats the overall majority in this model.
