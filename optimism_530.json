                    "content": "Based on the Cycle 10 experience, the Grants Council has determined that the Grant Proposal Template and submissions process can be improved to facilitate a more seamless experience for proposers and reviewers. For Cycle 11, each Sub-Committee has created its own Grant Proposal Template, designed to guide proposers to provide information most relevant to the Sub-Committee\u2019s evaluation criteria. Proposers should copy the proposal template for the relevant Sub-Committee and start a new post to the forum by filling out the proposal form under Grants Proposals. If you have any issues posting to the Forum, email a copy of your post, formatted for the forum, to optimismgrantsops@gmail.com and the post will be made on your behalf. The Council has determined that direct posting is the most efficient path to generating proposals. If you have submitted a Google Form application for Cycle 11, you will be notified by the Council of the new format and provided with a version of your application formatted to post easily to this forum. Please make sure to update the fields to include the parameters required for the grant type for which you are applying. Please find an FAQ for proposers here. For more information on the Grants Council, visit the Council\u2019s landing page. The deadline for Cycle 11 proposal submission is March 14 at 19:00 GMT.
