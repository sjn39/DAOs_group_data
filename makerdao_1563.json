This Wednesday and Thursday 9pm-10:30pm CEST I will continue to present the Endgame Plan v3, which is the latest iteration with major tokenomics simplifications, new terminology and new details around aspects such as how to respond to government crackdowns in the Endgame with Phoenix Stance. We are finally approaching the point where the plan can be presented in a simple enough format that a vote will soon be possible, and this will also be discussed at the call. There are now at least 3 active MetaDAO clusters, one for each Proof of Concept MetaDAO, so it will be important to get community agreement so that setting up forums and moving forward can be done - the practicalities of this will be a major focus this week.
