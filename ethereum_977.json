I would like to keep the compatibility with all the existing standards and infrastructure. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);  I was searching for \u201cNFT lending\u201d and saw this diagram via tinlake.com  examples1184\u00d7585 51.4 KB  It seems like the situation I describe would require \u201cNFT Deposit Contract\u201d or \u201cNFT Wrapper Contract\u201d that would be a superset of ERC-721. It would implement all the ERC-721 methods and a few more things:  internal state of ownership function transferring the barebone (unwraped, raw) token to the rightful owner  Before I start overthinking too much, are you aware of any similar work in the space?

I\u2019m hoping that a standardized way of checking ownership can be used by apps, and a common interface can allow the wrappers to cross-check with other wrappers using ownerOf and EIP-165. I think that this can be very useful, on top of rental use cases. I also made a prototype of this here:   GitHub    GitHub - flaskr/nft-lend-v2: Non-custodial NFT lending via pseudo-ownership Non-custodial NFT lending via pseudo-ownership. Contribute to flaskr/nft-lend-v2 development by creating an account on GitHub.      I\u2019ll like to build on it to include functions for  WrapperFactory that tracks created wrappers Ability to query for \u2018virtual ownership\u2019 across different wrapper contracts.  ",
