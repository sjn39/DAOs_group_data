While important I don\u2019t think it is as pressing as getting the flop auctions reset. Something Kurt did not point out is that with this flop auction Executive vote we can set a day/time for these to go off. I honestly would like to see these fire off around 9am EST on Friday but that means a thursday executive passing pretty quickly.   Otherwise I think based on the limited feedback in the CC we should set the time for 9am EST Monday. Hence I voted for single Friday executive since there is nothing absolutely pressing in monetary policy to my mind on rates except to lower SCD DC from 20-15M. Does anyone think that we need to bundle in anything else that is non-contentous into this executive.  The only thing I want to see simply because I want it done is the SCD DC lowered from 20-15M anything with SF\u2019s can wai a week since SF rates otherwise are basically near/at rock bottom.  As to debt limits we are seeing some additional minting in ETH-A. PEG is high but this could be due to other factors.   I know a few people will probably want to lower USDC SF to encourage more printing but honestly I want that facility as an emergency measure.  If anything I want the SF to go up slightly to force people to find other better ways to unwind their DAI short positions.   The key reason I did was because I considered 20% somewhat high rate.  Now if I wanted to mint some to participate in a flip I\u2019d do it in a heart beat even at 20%.    I really don\u2019t want to encourage more rate arb people to get into a trap they might not easily be able to get out of.  A high USDC SF rate does that.   Notice these players are immune to liquidation since there is no OSM and other technical reasons (but could be fixed).  I honestly would at least like to see a USDC/DAI OSM price oracle put up. ",

And it\u2019s also demoralizing to get outbid by an aggressive whale that\u2019s bidding to win everything. Which is why a lot of people gave up, no point positioning capital for the auction. We\u2019ll see how the auctions pan out. We could\u2019ve been close to a 1 keeper scenario. Basically if keepers don\u2019t have 2x the capital of how much DAI we\u2019re raising, you don\u2019t get a competitive auction with the current parameters. (Ex. 2m of DAI being raised. We have a whale, and other keepers with 1m in capital. You end up with 1m of competitive auctions, and the whale gets to win the other half of the auctions that expire at the minimum price) Options for the future  Redesign flop auctions completely. Smaller Lot sizes. TTL and TAU the same. Limit # of active auctions. More competition. Less capital required for competitive auctions.  ",
