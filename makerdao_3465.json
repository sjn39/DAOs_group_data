By going through the threads everyone seem to have a different opinion and is all a bit fragmented. Are there people assigned to this problem on the core team? What are the next steps? In my opinion: I am more for having vaults & governance using rollups while staying on Ethereum. Even though I see why, I don\u2019t like the idea to deploy to other L1s, even to see adoption. Especially not BSC. They can bridge DAI and use it, but the issuance shouldn\u2019t happen there. To me Maker is a synonym for security, decentralization and trust. BSC doesn\u2019t have those values ",
