We recently published a quiz that tests people\u2019s knowledge about EIP standards. (The information is directly from EIP-1) If a user passes the quiz their wallet becomes legible to mint a soulbound token, hence merit on earning the token. The token can be used for utility cases such as token gating or permitting governance voting. An example case here is if you want to submit an EIP you need to have the token verifying you know the appropriate process of EIPs. You can take a look at the platform here https://lirn.io/. I\u2019d love to connect with subject matter experts who are interested in creating multiple-choice quizzes to help verify knowledge onchain. Additionally, we\u2019re still in our beta stage so open feedback is encouraged. Thank you, Tint.eth ",
