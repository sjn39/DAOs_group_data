To prevent this 1- UNI liquidity pool with liquidty  rewards must be created with major rewards going to UNI pool 2- Small liquidity providers( say providing  liquidty below 1000usd) must be incentivised and a fix number of tokens kept for them , also it needs to mentioned that some mechanism to protect Sybil attack must be done to do this safely 3- partner with yearn and other good ecosystem  projects to to grow more utility 4- Make governance gasless and apply quadratic Voting to nullify whale attack Please if you like my idea , comment   hail Uniswap  and like and suggest improvements on above. Also any generous person put this proposal as I don\u2019t know how to do it. Thanks , Hail Uniswap  ",
