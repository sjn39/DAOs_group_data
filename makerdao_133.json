Regulators are definitely thinking about stablecoins, but mostly ones structured as fiat-redeemable (and subject to liquidity crises). They don\u2019t really know what to make of DAI, and often don\u2019t even consider it a stablecoin, though that\u2019s a thin defense against broad stablecoin regulation. Basically, the hostility from Fed/SEC isn\u2019t directed at DAI, but we don\u2019t want it to get lumped in with USDC/Tether by accident ",

What\u2019s interesting is that DAI/Maker isn\u2019t mentioned. Seems like they\u2019re more concerned with more traditional bank-like operations that have the potential to preform fractional lending. We\u2019ll see if that stays, but for now we\u2019re having a lot of discussions about the path forward throughout the DAO. PS if anyone knows how to upload a PDF here outside of taking images of the pages I\u2019d love to hear about it. Happy to screenshot and share for those without access to the NYT article. ",
