Paragraph Summary The TechOps Core Unit supports the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) MKR Budget structure discussed here. This is a 3-year vesting plan with 1-year cliff vest. The members of this Core Unit will take the start of the Feedback Period of this MIP (December 8, 2021) as the start date for the vesting schedule.  Key Parameters     Property Value     MKR/USD Lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6 month average from December 8, 2021   MKR/USD Lock-in Price (OG) 2,852.87 USD   MKR Price Floor -30% ($1,997)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 1 year   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, biannual MKR vesting   Vesting Interval 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes   MKR Expenditure Cap (Annual) 686.05 MKR   MKR Expenditure Cap (Total 3-Year) 2,058.15 MKR    The MKR Expenditure Cap included in the table above covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the projected 5.7 FTEs, including raises and repricing.  Current Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure is our best guess of how much MKR will be used with the current team configuration with 3.4 FTEs. This would result in the vesting schedule below:     Vesting Date MKR Amount     December 8, 2022 257.31   June 8, 2023 128.65   December 8, 2023 128.65   June 8, 2024 128.65   December 8, 2024 128.65   Total 771.92     On average, this would yield 75.68 MKR per FTE per year. Any changes to these amounts will be reported in our Monthly Budget Statements and reviewed by the budget auditors.  Reasons why the Actual MKR Expenditure could rise closer to the MKR Expenditure Cap:  New hires A compensation raise for a member of the team Repricing (and resetting) the program, in the case of bear market Price floor: -30%. If any Contributor chose to reprice their program, they could do it at a maximum of -30% from the set MKR price.   Payment Implementation  Wallet setup4113\u00d7519 43 KB   As defined in MIP40c3-SP53 and in the Monthly Budget Statement will contain the MKR vesting schedule. This schedule specifies when in the future MKR is vesting, and how much. To keep the risk acceptable for Maker governance as well as for the team, the MKR is moved from the protocol to the contributors in stages:  Following the MKR vesting schedule, any MKR that is vesting in 6 months or less, will be included in the top-up transaction which is added to the executive vote. This will move the MKR from the protocol to the TECH-001 Auditors Wallet, which then acts as an escrow wallet. Following the MKR vesting schedule, after review and approval by the auditors, any MKR that is vesting in 3 months or less, will be included in the monthly top-up transaction that moves funds from the TECH-001 Auditors Wallet to the TECH-001 Operational Wallet. When the MKR has vested, it is paid out to the contributor, either directly or through an intermediate payment processor.   Any excess MKR in the TECH-001 Auditors Wallet or the TECH-001 Operational Wallet will be returned to the protocol, following the monthly payment transactions.  This payment implementation makes no assumptions about the origin of the MKR. It can either be moved from the protocol\u2019s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source. The MKR that\u2019s held by the TECH-001 Auditors Wallet and the TECH-001 Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signaling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process. TECH-001 may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and that the risk is deemed acceptable by the team. ",

You bring up great points, @Zarevok. I\u2019ll try to answer in a succinct way, but this is part of a broader discussion.  Performance and Compensation The DAO needs to have different methods to evaluate offers and the performance of the Core Units. Ideally, we build frameworks to do this at scale, and all Core Units should be evaluated (both current and future). The compensation to perform different tasks should be evaluated against market prices as well. Some people have argued that in the past as well. The idea of a Core Unit to perform different types of audits is being floated by different members at the moment.  Market Research? Saying \u201cwe\u2019re paying [this group] too much\u201d is not particularly helpful. Mainly because it seems like an opinion. Also: happy to be corrected if you have some data about market prices.  Competition and the SES Incubation Program Having multiple Core Units performing overlapping functions increases the resiliency of the DAO and makes us stronger (more decentralized). If you happen to find a group of talented individuals that can do any critical functions for the DAO (including TechOps, Smart Contracts Development, Oracles, and a long list of et cetera), please put us in touch. We will be happy to discuss how to bring them on board. SES is happy to incubate any team that will help scale the DAO. We do have limited bandwidth (both in terms of talent and funds) so we need to prioritize and choose our battles. ",

I haven\u2019t gone through the TechOps budget yet - hoping to do that between Christmas and New Year, but I have no opinion on it as of now. I want to add some context to the Dai Foundation budget post for TechOps operations. Be aware that  It was an estimate I made and not based on any actual service offer The service level Dai Foundation requires is similar the service level we for example have with our financial services provider. We have a need which is logged and then the provider puts it into their backlog and solves it as part of their operations within normal working hours within a reasonable number of days. Dai Foundation has in general no requirements for   having a full team available 24x7 with a diverse set of skills ready to respond at any time having advanced monitoring solutions built and maintained etc  The needs of Dai Foundation are very different from supporting an infrastructure that need to work all the time where there need to be the right resources to respond immediately to critical incidents. Different service levels and breadth of services have different price tags, so I don\u2019t think the Dai Foundation budget item can be used a benchmark here. ",

Now remember \u201cMKR Expenditure Cap (Annual)\u201d value in the Key Parameters table is an absolute possible maximum MKR amount, opposed to the actual average per FTE. The big difference in values is because instead of using the 180 day average MKR price in the second formula above, the \u201cMKR Price Floor\u201d was used instead (for reasons see above, mainly repricing); and also the salary was scaled by 10%.
