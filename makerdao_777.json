                    "content": "@LongForWisdom is currently managing the implementation of mkrgov.science, an analytics dashboard that creates more transparency around the governance of the Maker system. I think this is a great step forward and would like to continue down this path by proposing the use of Grafana for customizable dashboarding.  What is Grafana? Grafana is an open source dashboarding interface can connect to numerous data source to visualize and alert on them. It has a permissioning system that would allow trusted individuals in the community to have access to create and arrange new visualization into interesting dashboards. These dashboards can then be made public to share with community. Here\u2019s a live demo so you can see what I mean  What will this do for us? For the Maker community this removes some the burden of building and maintaining a UI and allows us to focus on integrating metrics and exploring the Maker system. I think this will make it easier to deliver valuable insight and iterate on them in the future. For the community this will mean more valuable insights and increased transparency, but it will also mean developer resources can be spent on other parts of the system that need it.  What are the challenges? Primarily data ingestion. How do we get on-chain data into a time series data store (like InfluxDB, Prometheus, or Carbon) that Grafana can consume? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were already open source projects for doing this, though this will require investigation. Alternatively there may be some adapter that allows Grafana to connect directly to an Ethereum node, or Infura, and if none of these exists then we can always write an adapter, or a service, for doing this our selves. None of these things are difficult, but they will require some thought and energy put into them to make sure they are done right. I\u2019m also unsure how hosting, credentials, domain names, etc\u2026 are managed. I don\u2019t mind managing credentials, but at some point the project should be handed over to the community. Likewise, I don\u2019t know how the team will want to manage access control. I\u2019d appreciate support and guidance on these things.  Next steps I wanted to propose the idea for discussion because it may not be a new idea, or it may not be as valuable as I think. Maybe there is already something in the works and I don\u2019t know about it? If the community feels like this would be valuable though then I\u2019ll propose a tech stack, and keep moving forward.  Last but not least I\u2019m new here so I may be a bit early to be proposing governance initiatives, but I think this could be really useful. I appreciate critical feedback and look forward to learning  ",

I had kind of mentioned in one of my previous posts that I think a lot of the data that is out there is a bit too hard to read. I think having a prometheus db to connect to in order to read out some of this historical data would probably be a start on simplifying some of that. Consider adding some issues to your github repo for work that you plan to do, and probably add a license to it as well. Maybe add something to the projects projects board to show works in progress. If you did that you might start getting some pull requests . ",

Hey Andy, I appreciate you asking  I didn\u2019t think it was ready for others to start jumping in because it\u2019s very early but I went ahead and added a license and a few issues. The current open issues are around adding Prometheus collectors for collecting metrics on MCD contracts. I think these are the most important because these metrics will give us stats we can play with to start to understand if this is really valuable. I\u2019ve also been working on go-maker, a Golang library for interacting with the MCD contract system and am using maker-monitor to dogfood my own library here. go-maker is also early, but coming together quickly and I expect to support all of the MCD system contracts in the next 1-2 weeks. It would be great if you want to collab on either project ",
