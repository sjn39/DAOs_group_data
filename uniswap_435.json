                    "content": "I\u2019m Chris Blec and I\u2019m offering myself up as an option for UNI vote delegation. My delegate address is reluctantdelegate.eth, or  0x84bb5196F0085D61a7C9AC5B903a26D7f009aC13 Why a \u201creluctant delegate\u201d? I believe that adding a governance token to Uniswap may have been a mistake. The protocol was working well without governance, and I believe that the token issuance was less about decentralizing power and more about increasing potential ROI for venture capital investors. I understand the need to be able to compete with competitors who may attempt to suck liquidity out, however I\u2019m not convinced that tokenized governance is the best way to do it. With that being said, as of now, I still believe that Uniswap is the best option available for fans of decentralization. As a delegate with absolutely no big-money connections, I will be committed to only voting in favor of proposals that will actually decentralize decision-making. I will never vote in favor of a proposal that will give more power or weight to UNI whales, since the current system freely offers them the vast majority of the power. I will be highly transparent and regularly share my point of view on my YouTube channel at https://youtube.com/chrisblec. I will also conduct regular UNI voter conversations like this one. ** While I do hope that my efforts result in a stronger UNI economy due to increased governance participation, my primary goal will not be focused entirely on the value of UNI. I will often criticize UNI whales, investors, founders, and the governance process itself if I see reason to. I am not necessarily here to build a strong public image for Uniswap. But, I do hope that the addition of my unique point of view will ultimately make Uniswap and UNI stronger and more resilient to attacks on liquidity, governance, or otherwise. My primary mission will be to always ensure that we are working toward a system that puts the wishes of small token holders on the same level as whales, and to increase governance participation amongst minnows. In that regard, less governance may often be better than more. Do not expect me to vote YES very often, especially on proposals that originate from whales and corporations. It\u2019s good for you to understand in advance that my highly principled approach will likely be called obstructionist, trouble-making, and a general pain-in-the-butt by the governance community. Be ready for this. I will not even consider voting YES for a Dharma airdrop proposal that is put forth by Dharma, a DeFi whale or a corporation. I will, however, consider hearing arguments in favor an airdrop proposal that is thoughtfully put forth by a user without VC connections, preferably in an autonomous proposal with considerable support from many unique small UNI holders. If there is a chance that more UNI voting power can reasonably be put into the hands of individual end-users, I will consider it. I believe that the next year of UNI governance may play a significant role in the founding principles of future - hopefully better - DeFi governance models. I hope that the work that we do here inspires future projects to launch with better, more trustless governance. My goal is to provide a reliable delegation option for those who share the above outlined principles. If you have any questions for me, please comment below.  ** Quick disclaimer: I monetize my DeFi video content as a primary source of income, and I may begin offering some video content (possibly UNI-related) behind a paywall.  Thanks for hearing me out, Chris Blec ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m not exactly sure either on the exact distribution, ideally we need to incentivise tokens which would cause Uniswap to be even more competitive with other DeFi and more importantly CeFi programs. Firstly, not continuing the ETH rewards in some capacity could lead to mini flash crash (Due to masss selling of ETH), which would be bad for the whole ecosystem. Perhaps and this is just a guess, we keep the ETH/DAI reward where it is but reduce the ETH/USDT and ETH/USDC reward by perhaps 40%. ETH/WBTC I\u2019m not to sure on, perhaps leave that where it is to. This would free up about 20% of the rewards, this could be split 2% each towards 10 smaller tokens, so as not to artificially pump the price too much. Again, not to sure on what exactly, but tokens like LEND/AAVE, COMP, LINK, MKR, CRV, NXM, REP, YFI? or even UNI might be the types of coins best to use. Uni is a controversial one, as it would disincentivize voting, however it could also help bring those tokens off centralised platforms, where they could be voted from there. ",
