                    "content": "hello i\u2019ve been writing a paper that goes into the basic functioning of the maker protocol. i would much appreciate if someone could help me with these basic questions (im only resorting to this channel cause i couldnt find a answer in the whitepaper/tech docs and do not posses the savyness to explore the sourcecode): the whitepaper refers to the Dai savings rate as the main mechanism to adjust the demand for Dai. From what i understand, the funds used to pay the return on savings are raised via stability fee (?).   If the stability fee is used to make the Maker Buffer, how does the protocol divide the funds raised via fees between the buffer, the return on savings and surplus auctions?   Is the stability fee the only service fee charged by the protocol? Is it paid once at the act of closure of the Vault?   Where do liquidation Penalties go? in the case the outstanding debt is not entirely covered by the collateral auction, is it burned?   it seems like there is arbitrage opportunitiy from opening vaults and selling Dai when the price is high and closing vaults and buying Dai when price is low. is this an important part to maintaining the peg (meaning is there a lot of money being raised this way)?   a vault can be closed just by its opener? in case of under collaterization, can it be liquidated by anyone, or jus MKR holders? does a liquidator check current prices by his/her own account or does he use an oracle linked to the protocol? if its the 1st, i assume the protocol checks with its oracle to se if it initiates the liquidation process or not, is that it ?   i appologize if the questions seem trivial from a user perspective but i get paid in shitty currency and cant afford to play around with ETH. I\u2019ll try testnet, although im kind of a newbie and have a tight deadline. I\u2019m really thankful for anyone who read it for the attention. 2fold for the ones that reply. All the best, from Brasil. ",

                    "content": "    pfranc:  the whitepaper refers to the Dai savings rate as the main mechanism   This is only half true. The DSR prevents the peg from falling below 1.0. The PSM vaults prevent the peg from rising above 1.0.     pfranc:  the whitepaper refers to the Dai savings rate as the main mechanism to adjust the demand for Dai. From what i understand, the funds used to pay the return on savings are raised via stability fee   Yes     pfranc:  how does the protocol divide the funds raised via fees between the buffer, the return on savings and surplus auctions?   Governance decides when and how much of the surplus buffer to spend on flap auctions that buy and burn MKR.     pfranc:  Is the stability fee the only service fee charged by the protocol?   Yes, but also note that user interfaces like Oasis and DeFi Saver charge an additional fee for services.     pfranc:  Is it paid once at the act of closure of the Vault?   It is paid continuously (per block).     pfranc:  Where do liquidation Penalties go?   To the surplus buffer.     pfranc:  in the case the outstanding debt is not entirely covered by the collateral auction, is it burned?   If outstanding debt is not entirely covered by the collateral auction then it needs to be covered by some other means. The amount will be deducted from the surplus buffer. If the surplus buffer is empty then MKR will be auctioned for DAI to cover the deficit (flop auction).     pfranc:  it seems like there is arbitrage opportunitiy from opening vaults and selling Dai when the price is high and closing vaults and buying Dai when price is low.   Yes     pfranc:  is this an important part to maintaining the peg (meaning is there a lot of money being raised this way)?   No, we regard this an unwanted lack of DAI liquidity. Ideally, DAI should stay at 1.0 regardless of the demand.     pfranc:  a vault can be closed just by its opener?   Yes, but anybody can pay down the debt.     pfranc:  in case of under collaterization, can it be liquidated by anyone   Yes     pfranc:  does a liquidator check current prices by his/her own account   Could be. You can write custom proprietary software to help liquidate vaults.     pfranc:  im kind of a newbie and have a tight deadline   Okay, I did your homework for you  ",
