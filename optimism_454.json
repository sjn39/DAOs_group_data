(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Growth Experiment Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): The \u201cTiny Dino Show\u201d is an NFT-based animated story aimed at kids and young adults. The Tiny Dinos NFTs are the main characters in the show, and together they are on a mission to save our planet from global warming. Tiny dinos were one of the first projects (second to Gh0stly Gh0sts) minted across seven chains and can be traversed from Optimism to Ethereum and back thanks to Layer Zero. Not only there are Genesis tiny dinos that were minted on Optimism, but there were also three event collections with Summer 2022, Halloween 2022, and Winter 2022 one-way traversals, with Optimism being one of the cost-friendly networks. The Tiny Dino Show is an independent, community project utilizing the power of #cc0 licensing of the Tiny Dinos NFT and bringing our audience new perspectives on the world of living green, loving the planet, and exploring novel ways of generating, storing, and transporting clean energy.In January 2023, we won a 2ETH Prop House round sponsored by the Tiny Dinos and launched a JuiceBox campaign for the rest of the funding that is needed for the production of Season 1 and beyond. Our soft goal is 10ETH, and with this first contribution, we can start the pre-production process, and will be looking to include Optimism in our show material.The mission of the Tiny Dino Show is aligned with Optimism\u2019s ethos for creating public goods and educating about ways of creating a sustainable future. The Tiny Dinos is a perfect way for the Optimism Collective to highlight its provenance and involvement in the NFT space.

We are in contact with Atrium as a studio for professional help or a potential partner. Together with the Nouns they support the same ethos of building public goods.Nouns DAOThere are other examples of the networks like Polygon breaking into NFTs, and NFT brands like Doodles breaking into video production by purchasing an animation studio: The Block: Doodles to buy animation studio Golden Wolf: Billboard. The Tiny Dino Show is the OG in the omnichain space, based on free IP thanks to cc0, and is much lighter and quicker in production because of the focus on storytelling and using the original 2d cartoon images with professional voices. Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 4/5/2022 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: There are no existing NFT projects that are aligned with the Optimism ethos as much as tiny Dinos. Optimism has limited NFT exposure and limited educational video exposure. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: The production of the Season 1 of the \u201cTiny Dino Show\u201d could be sponsored by the Optimism Collective with complete Episodes delivered and auctioned (optional). By contributing to the show, the Optimism Collective is supporting the creators in the two most innovative areas currently for the NFTs: omnichain and cc0. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: The growing popularity of omnichain and NFTs will bring more use cases for cost-efficient chains such as Optimism, whether it is for governance, gaming, or finance. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 10,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: n/a How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): n/a How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): The OP grant would be distributed based on wallet eligibility, which could be determined by the proof of interaction with our JuiceBox smart contract. There can be a fixed or floating number of tokens or eligible wallets, such that there\u2019s no correlation to ETH value of donations, or the Show NFTs, or the $TDS tokens. With this grant, the Tiny Dino Show will further proliferate the use of Optimism network for Tiny Dinos and will shine the spot light on the ethos of both projects, and increase in network usage/ value retained. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: We are running the JuiceBox campaign for the production of Season 1 of the Show and propose launching a 30-day cycle where the donators to the campaign can become eligible for OP token reward. Additionally, we wanted to propose using 80% of the OP tokens reserved for eligible wallets (those who donate to the campaign), and 20% for the Optimism Tiny Dino NFT holders - thus providing an incentive to lock the value on the Optimism network after the traversal. Disclosures: The donators are incentivized with the $TDS tokens, and get NFT posters as a reward for their ETH contributions - there is a closed loop within Ethereum network. The Show production team would not be incentivized by OP tokens or the grant, nor would it make the team members eligible for future distribution. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable:  Pre-production - 1 month, Starting Feb Social media OP partnership announcement, promotions and show collection giveaways. JuiceBox - Tiny Dino Show - Optimism campaign, Feb - March 30-day cycle for the Show donations. Release - May/ June 2023  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Optimism Tiny Dino NFT holders will be eligible for 20% of the grant, which would serve as an incentive to keep the dinos on Optimism chain after traversing, apart from other benefits, such as transaction cost, and supporting the mission of the project. NFT marketplaces are working to bring together the collections that originate on Layer Zero and offer omnichain assets. For example, the Tiny Dinos NFT consists of 3 collections across 7 chains, which fragments the liquidity into 21 separate markets. With the Pudgy Penguins jumping the gun on omnichain, the Open Sea is rushing to create an interface that combines all omnichain collections and will hopefully bring more liquidity to other chains like Optimism. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): The Tiny Dino Show is using Tiny Dino Show | Juicebox for its treasury and as a way to reward those who donate to the show. The deployer wallet (0xAFDAF4C0fb1c0d025F81E4707C1b123c9a620aB9) for that contract holds tinydinoshow.eth which resolves to the Tiny Dino Show Treasury multi-sig: 0x2F63e9c5f1927B103a5a085133A17C711Ab20b18The Tiny Dino Show Treasury also holds several show assets - the NFTs that are used in the show as characters or in production like sounds and graphics.https://opensea.io/0x2F63e9c5f1927B103a5a085133A17C711Ab20b18 Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

We plan on acquiring more assets for the Season\u2019s production and could traverse the entire character set into Optimism, thus locking more value on the network. This could be the direct use for overflow funds, i.e. the funds that are contributed over the target of ~10ETH (based on the number of limited NFT posters for Season 1). To address the separation and future sale concerns: with JuiceBox, our own ERC-20 token eligibility is determined at a fixed rate of X/per 1 ETH, subject to change. $TDS tokens are given as a co-incentive (same as NFTs), but will not be available for transfer until we actually mint tokens and enable the claim feature. The way we see $OP tokens is as a co-incentive similar to $TDS, and we could determine the rate of distribution \u2013 be it a fixed rate with minimum ETH contribution (same as NFTs), or based on the % of the total pool contributed to the Show during the 30-day cycle. As far as the sales go, we can only hope that contributors who support the \u201cTiny Dino Show\u201d will enjoy their experience and keep supporting the network after OP tokens are unlocked, maybe even used to purchase more dinos on Optimism! Finished video product(s), as well as promotional materials can be produced and actioned as NFTs on Optimism, as there are other ways to keep the value locked on the network and providing liquidity for the market.

The donations to the Show, or ETH contributions, are without an expectation of profit and should not  be considered contracts for income, or interest earned, and they are marked as \u201cdonations\u201d on JuiceBox. The ETH funds derived from the donations are used for the production, which includes the salaries of the crew. The Donators are incentivized with the $TDS tokens, and get NFT posters as a reward for their ETH contributions - there is a closed loop within Ethereum network. The Show production team would not be incentivized by OP tokens or the grant, nor would it make the team members eligible for future distribution. The OP grant would be distributed based on wallet eligibility, which could be determined by the proof of interaction with our JuiceBox smart contract. There can be a fixed or floating number of tokens or eligible wallets, such that there\u2019s no correlation to ETH value of donations, or the Show NFTs, or the $TDS tokens. This experiment can be viewed as Optimism making a product placement, and those who donate (contribute) to the show campaign will be rewarded by the Optimism Collective for their support, and without an expectation of profit.
