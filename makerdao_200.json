                    "content": " Summary After polling on the idea to invest in financials assets here, it was incorporated in the RWF strategy (the Scalable off-chain investments bucket). It was also discussed with the RWA Committee this week. This post provides more information on the current status.  The idea Even with the bull run resuming, we still hold more than 50% of stablecoin on the balance sheet. This is a strength for the peg, but doesn\u2019t generate any revenue, is a concentration risk, and is bad PR.  image812\u00d7348 25.4 KB  Institutional vaults and \u201cregular\u201d RWA might, at some point, solve the problem but it is impossible to expect perfect balance sheet management with such tools. You don\u2019t fire DAI supply in short term. We are extending the credit line so we also need a buffer. Therefore, we will always need a buffer of liquidity (defined as any assets that can be sold in short term to keep the peg (from a few minutes to a few days). The final idea would work like the diagram below. For each fiat-backed stablecoin PSM we would define a target DC (let\u2019s say 3% of DAI issued) with a min/max range (2.5%-3.5% for instance). When the DC of the PSM is above the the max target, the excess (possibly converted in DAI) would be send to a cryptobroker to be converted to cash, send to a stockbroker and invested in a ETF. We would increase a ETF-A vault in our system. The ETF would be a short term investment grade bond.  image951\u00d7284 6.57 KB  The opposite can be done when the a PSM is below a min target. This might require human judgement (MKR executive). This way, we limit our exposure to fiat-backed stablecoins to a defined level. There is a counterparty risk with the stockbroker and the ETF. Nevertheless, even $1B would be small.  Were are we?  Legal structure/KYC/AML The idea is to leverage the work done on the RWA Foundations. The first, RWA Foundation, used for SolarX, is incorporated in Caymans and all the corporated servicers have been appointed. They are currently working on getting a KYC/AML package for US Bank (which is not used here). If we pass US Bank KYC/AML we should be good to move to other providers. There is still the formal Articles of Associations to be implemented and defined the MakerDAO/RWA Foundation communication processes. The final setup will have a to be rubberstamped by a global law firm. The legal entity would have nothing to do on the DAI \u2192 ETF way (beside accounting). For the other way, I\u2019m not sure a stock broker will be able to take the decision itself or take direction from a third party (i.e. MKR executive). So the legal entity will have something to do.  Cryptobrokers We have two leads but waiting on the KYC package. I\u2019m still trying to find a global servicer provider that could take DAI and deal with everything. So far no luck.  Stockbroker Not much work here aws being done. Waiting on the KYC package and the actual ETF selection to find the best partner. The ETF providers are able to introduce us.  ETF I had discussion with VanEck and Vanguard at this stage. They all favor the use of an ETF (versus a managed account) for simplicity and cost. Both are low duration risk (duration < 2 years), with exposure mainly US (but not only which adds diversity). Both are able to provide 100M of volume over a day if we go through a market-maker like Jane Street. The proposed products are the following:   VanEck Investment Grade Floating Rate ETF: US based ETF. Duration risk on this one is almost 0 as the bonds are floating rates. Currently below 0.5% yield, more safe.  Vanguard USD Corporate 1-3 Year Bond UCITS ETF (USD) Accumulating Ireland based ETF. Currently 0.6% yield.  In order to add an ESG product:   iShares $ Corp Bond 0-3yr ESG UCITS ETF Ireland-based. Not super convinced by the ESG (you have stuff like Toyota, all the bank, \u2026)  So it\u2019s about scale, reducing/managing the USDC exposure and getting some revenues (but not much in the current environment). The risk is up to a 5% drop which was seen during the Covid crisis. It was not that bonds defaulted but credit spread increased and there was strong liquidity issues. In normal markets, not much happens. This remains to be analyzed. We can go higher on the quality ladder but we would get nothing in return (there will be structure/trading fees).  Smart-contract/Oracles The poll was to go forward with MIP21. I still have doubts it would work at scale, but we can start experimentation with that. I\u2019m drafting a study on how to fix this problem (at least to frame the problem).  Next steps Assuming there is no strong opposition, we will continue working to move the project forward. Feel free to provide comment and ideas. ",

I think that these great ideas from the Maker team could be used for great impacts!  ",

These are our \u201cforeign currency reserves\u201d that are needed to defend the DAI <> USD peg. We really cannot afford even small risk of losses, as they already back existing DAI. They also need to be extremely liquid so that we can regularly sweep back and forth between the PSM and the reserves (perhaps ETF, perhaps T-bills, perhaps something else). We want a non-zero yield because we have so much operating leverage. But a lot of the motivation is to reduce credit risk concentration to USDC. At the end of the day, it needs to be extremely liquid and extremely safe. That\u2019s not a large universe of investment choices, and I suspect the ones @SebVentures has suggested will be our best choices, or at least very similar to our best choices. ",

The AML Act of 2020 is currently without rules, but includes the exchange of digital currencies in an expansion of the Bank Secrecy Act.

PSMs are real-time, don\u2019t yield anything, and face an undefined counterparty risk. Those short-term ETF would be the second line of defense for the peg. I had some talk with tokenizer startups, but really the regulatory uncertainty is a real problem, and such an ETF is not at all the priority for them. Therefore we will use the TradFi route which at least is proven for decades. It will also give us building blocks for the future. The third line of defense is the rates on the crypto-back loans. The last line of defense is institutional vault and/or the other RWA. I understand some think the yield is way too low, some think the risk is way too high. I\u2019m also concerned about all the structuring costs and the complexity of the matter. I\u2019m also thinking of doing one US route (the VanEck or whatever else) and one Ireland route (the Vanguard one) to get maximal redundancy in case it\u2019s needed. ",

ETF shares are utterly centralized but don\u2019t offer such a convenience. Is the plan to tokenize the ETF shares through the relevant RWA Foundation? (2) Even if the plan is to tokenize the ETF shares through the RWA foundation, tokenized centralized ETF shares are inferior to the tokenized centralized money market shares called USDC in several noteworthy ways: (1) tokenized centralized ETF shares are not highly liquid on-chain, whereas USDC are (2) tokenized centralized ETF shares will be centralized under the management of a completely unregulated and untested foundation team, whereas Circle at least has a lot of eyeballs on it and a long-ish operating history (3) the blacklisting of tokens is a red herring and the real risk for both USDC and tokenized ETF shares is essentially just counterparty risk (blacklisting is a subspecies of counterparty risk)\u2026the counterparty risk is higher, not lower, for a new RWA Foundation than it is for Circle (see point (2)) (4) although ETFs can grow in value (unlike USDC) and thus offer \u2018yield\u2019, USDC also offers yield opportunities (and have the advantage of being on-chain). USDC dominance in MakerDAO collateral is really bad (because of its centralization/counterparty risk) but basically just trying to turn MakerDAO itself into the new Circle by standing up an entity that stabilizes the peg in the same custodial-money-market way as Circle and Tether do seems like a very weird way of addressing the downsides of USDC within MakerDAO.

The point about ETF being utterly centralized is kind of moot as this is the direction MakerDAO is going anyway. You do RWA, you have a link to the real world. Is Circle a better counterparty than Blackrock? Is an ETF more robust than a stablecoin? Those are the questions. It\u2019s not a plan to tokenize anything.     lex_node:  centralized under the management of a completely unregulated and untested foundation team   On the RWA Foundation, the counsel of NebulaCapital and Monetalis ended up with the same structure i.e. having a legal entity managed by servicers that act on MakerDAO wishes. In the case of ETF, those servicers could be JTC or Intertrust (keeping the Foundation in good standing), Genesis Trading (DAI <-> USD), Jane Street (primary market making) and BlackRock (ETF management). All wired so it is automated to the maximum. Unregulated and untested seems a bit strong to say the least. Or again, it can apply to any RWA. To avoid any doubt, there is no such thing as a team.

Hopefully that might stir up some interest.  revenue1595\u00d7587 59.5 KB  If you take a look at the current revenue run rate of MKR you are pulling around $100 ~$150MM annually, and currently there is about $4B worth of PSM collateral that is sitting around underutilized. In addition, the situation with the US treasuries is a good bit better than it was 6 mo ago in terms of yield. If you take a look here you can see 5 year treasuries are yielding about 1.55% these days. I went and found a vanguard etf would give exposure to the 5 year treasuries. The dividend yield on that guy is currently around 1.72%. Lets say, that you guys get this spun up and invest 50% of the PSM funds into that vanguard etf. You would be looking at an annual revenue of around $34.4MM for doing that. That figure is no small sum. It\u2019s about a 23% increase from current run rate.

I wonder if taking shorter-term duration risk but credit risk (meaning investment-grade still) wouldn\u2019t be more correlated to our crypto-lending business. When everything is fine, CDS are on the way down (good for such ETF) and people take leverage (hence decreasing our liquidity while interest rates are rising). Not sure it is correct. If it is, then probably we need both. Btw, not saying this should drive the decision (nor taken into account at all), Vanguard is quite opposed to crypto while a provider like VanEck is driving crypto forward and might be a partner down the road. We might also want to take in account the domiciliation. I kind of like the Ireland-based accumulating ETFs as it\u2019s simple to manage and let us be a step remote from US regulation (legal structure and broker). The underlying (t-bills for instance) would be the same. Not sure how relevant that is. It is an implementation detail but might (or not) be an important one. ",

I can see pro/cons for both. One key reason for CU might be that these investments could be completely flow-through (i.e. taking both losses and gains) I\u2019d imagine rather than requiring being \u2018senior\u2019 to anything, such as to capture full yield (one would not need junior/equity exposure in front of the type of ETF/Government bonds I see considered in this post thread, I\u2019d imagine, from a risk perspective). One key reason for 3rd party rather than CY could be governance and arms-length dynamics - and of course the overall goal of max decentralization. b) How to get a cost effective structure to underpin it? (i.e. legal, responsibilities, trustees, attestors, governance etc)? And this could probably be different from CU or 3rd party of course. One could piggy-back on current structures being implemented (so as to keep structural cost down), but it would have to be thought through in detail. c) How to get institutional participants in this structure that can handle large amounts - and at speed (as this is to replace a liquidity instrument)? Number of potential participants shrink dramatically if you need up to a 1B USD over a few days in cases of emergency etc I suspect? d) How to have an appropriate asset selection and trading strategy to not get caught out in moving markets and have liquidity access? I can see in this thread, that this discussion is already on-going, but somehow a cohesive full strategy probably would need to be put in place and discussed before the \u2018on\u2019 button needs pressed? e) If it is going to be via a vault mechanics and 3rd parties with collateralization measures then how then to setup a correct collateralization test to not get caught out in cases of mark-to-market type market jitters? I suppose one of the reasons I think sebastian is suggesting a more direct approach? f)  As this is to handle liquidation at speed, that process, as Eric says, would really need to be thought through in detail for situations of systemic pressures on overall economic system - and compared with the liquidation/value risks one could believe there is with USDC/etc? I wonder if a productive next step would for someone to ask for a community signal on overall approach for this? Sort just a quick current temperature check on where the community is in terms of direction? A lot of work otherwise might be done by someone going down a less desired path? ",

There appear to be other means at the DAOs disposal to deal with this issue. in the event that the PSM dries up AND DAI was trading for < $1 AND no one using this circumstance as an opportunity to pay down their debt the DAO would always be able to increase the DSR which should result in people locking up more dai decreasing the supply + driving up demand. This should in principle cause the PSM to grow. It\u2019s just like Seb said here    The history of a DAI at par value What can we learn from it?   The PSM, therefore, represents the imbalance between DAI supply and DAI demand. The adjustment variable is no longer the price.

This CU is narrowing down its focus to ensure a more streamlined delivery for structured investments (i.e. pooled assets). The Methodology for MIP6 and the due diligence work that underlies should give a good flavour of why the focus is narrowed.

Maker needs to understand its balance sheet liabilities build a reasonable plan to manage these, particularly in financial downturns.

The real problem here is this:     Allan_Pedersen:  How to have an appropriate asset selection and trading strategy to not get caught out in moving markets and have liquidity access? I can see in this thread, that this discussion is already on-going, but somehow a cohesive full strategy probably would need to be put in place and discussed before the \u2018on\u2019 button needs pressed?   We are looking at inflation at historic 50 year highs.  CBs currently are looking at ~200bps worth of short term interest raises in 12 months.    Now sure if a fund is managing this so that they basically ride bonds to redemption you don\u2019t lose from a cash perspective.    In an ETF there is no guarantees about how this will be managed.   bond ETFs can go down in a rate rising environment. Something I am still trying to come to terms with.   Is the key goal here to lay off USDC risk or earn return.    Access to liquidity is going to be a key issue here.   Point is to have access to USDC liquidity while laying off USDC risk literally are opposing issues.    From my seat the cleanest way to lay off the USDC risk is to do it via DeFI.   Uniswap or Guni USDC-DAI is most interesting because liquidity is guaranteed and still earns some return.   D3M interesting but has potential liquidity access issues.   Anything that drives USDC out into the world is going to have significant liquidity latency, costs, and market risks. Personally if I am looking at a good approach here that satisfies constraints I would look at a 3 tier approach. As rates increase look to putting 10-20% in pieces (1-3%) into mid-range return ETF (goal to try to get to 200-400bps returns which will translate into 20-40bps on entire portfolio) Take something like the other 20-30% of the USDC and split it into operating D3M which should operate not just on the deposit side but also the borrow side to manage both deposit and borrow rates for DAI and USDC on AAVE, Compound and potentially elsewhere.   Goal here to earn a net 20-50bps return while also managing both deposit and borrow rates. Another 20-30% in Uniswap or Guni in USDC-DAI.  Try to operate with about 10-30% total USDC in the PSM (this is still a bit high but probably necessary in case of significant market event).  This is to mostly lay off USDC centralization risk not necessarily earn return. Notice that with 20-30% in Uniswap/Guni we have access to additional liquidity.   With D3Ms (both operating on borrow and deposit sides) we can manage DeFI rates.  And with the 10-20% in ETF or longer term exposures we can earn some return. I agree with Andy on:     Andy_McCall:  Further what happens to these assets in the event of ES? Can\u2019t exactly redeem dai for 1/25 a share of FLTR, so again how would these assets be managed in that type of situation?   or     Andy_McCall:  For instance in another black thursday style event where you see the Stability buffer go negative. Would the RWA foundation be legally obligated to do anything with these assets? What would those obligations be?   I probably will vote for the MIP6 to investigate this but I am distinctly against making a CU just for this (this should come under RWF mandate). While I am for relevant CUs giving a report on this I am more for Maker taking a deeper dive on the D3Ms and Uni/Guni here and looking to manage both deposit and borrow side rates and also look at taking some of this USDC off the books via uniswap or guni positions as these are the most highly liquid positions that earn us return with much less counterparty or liquidity risks.
