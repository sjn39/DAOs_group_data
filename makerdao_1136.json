A few thoughts: the last several weeks with UST\u2019s implosion have been difficult for crypto and stable coins but also provided some useful insights: (1)  Algorithmic-stable coins are fragile and tend towards collapse eventually as their value is based on a recursive social belief that isnt robust (2)  The DAI is exposed to serious liquidity shocks in such stressed times.  Over this liquidity shock, the PSM stablecoin base fell by 30% over a one week period and almost 50% over a two month period (3)  Prudent ALM and liquidity management strategies must to be able to withstand liquidity shocks of this magnitude, but potentially larger ones as well.  The question is how much larger?? (4)  The jury is still out on the viability of Tether - if this stable coin fails, it will likely cause a larger liquidity shock to Maker and crypto in general ",
