While it is referred to as a Council, the event would involve multiple meetings: larger meetings for big decisions, smaller meetings for the deliberations of the Working Groups, etc. The current proposal is to have:  \u201cTriannual meetings, two coordinated with Devcon and EthCC and one in July.\u201d  Perhaps consensus would be reached on a proposal in a particular meeting, but in order to include those who cannot attend the Council, the decision would only be formally arrived at later on in a conference call. Other Magician-related events are ad-hoc but of course critical to the work:  \u201cMeetups, discussions, presentations, workshops, hackathons, and other relevant activities. These can organized by participants on an ad-hoc basis or with the sponsorship of the Fellowship.\u201d  This is from the \u201cin-person practices\u201d in the Fellowship proposal. ",

So \u2026 these are assumed to all be technical decisions. I might just remove the \u201cTechnical\u201d part and call it \u201cCompetence\u201d. Hard! So if I were to add a \u201cWho Should Attend\u201d section to the wiki, it would be something like:  technical experts who can code people who care about how Ethereum evolves ???  Also I don\u2019t totally understand what the Web3 Foundation means by logistics \u2013 so they are going to do venue, registration, catering, etc. etc.?

Currently all proposals are being filed here: https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues. The EIP editors work with the author and run it through the workflow defined in EIP-1. Before the Magicians\u2019 proposal, the discussion would occur in the issues comments, on reddit, and in the All Core Devs calls. We felt as if better technical discussions would occur in a threaded format, either in email or a forum like what we have set up here.     boris:  Also I don\u2019t totally understand what the Web3 Foundation means by logistics \u2013 so they are going to do venue, registration, catering, etc. etc.?   Initially this is securing the venue, I expect they will help with the catering. Registration might be something that we can coordinate among the Magicians.     boris:  If I were attending, I would want to contribute to costs as needed.   We could sell tickets, however the likely venue may wish it to be fee of charge (i.e. they wouldn\u2019t want this to be a for-profit or corporate event).     boris:  Are we looking for sponsors?   We should definitely find some, I think it that it would be OK with the venue but will confirm. Aya from the Ethereum Foundation expressed interest in sponsoring at the last Council (which she attended), and we can ask others as well. ",

Not a for-profit event - ticket revenue would go towards covering costs with eg food, live streaming, etc. It is my belief that setting an expectation of everyone pitching in will make events sustainable. Also allows the events to scale. The biggest cost for an individual is likely to be travel & accommodation in any case. The sooner we can get a survey up to see who might want to attend, the sooner we can start looking at venue sizing & catering. Google Survey? I can get this done if desired. ",
