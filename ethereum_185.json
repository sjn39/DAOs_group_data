For now I got:   @austingriffith with metatx: https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84  Gnosis Safe, in Beta provides this feature. Testing and excited! @koeppelmann  Tenzorum that\u2019s also on PK management. I can\u2019t find their dedicated repo to token abstraction though.  Anyone else knows people? would love to gather projects with different approaches that help the discussion. The Workshop will be led by Golem UX, but @qnou, Hester & Patrik from Status, Karol and Pat from Colony,and Ben and Chris from 0x also helping out. If you are already signed up for ETHBerlin, super invited to join us on this discussion! if you cannot make it and have a good project on this topic or similar, post here! ",

The outline of it is going to  look like\u2026  What is product onboarding & user activation? Problems with web3 onboarding and user activation? Present the concept of gasless transactions and their capabilities How does it work?  \u2192 Workshop would be to think how it could fit into the participant\u2019s own project  While this workshop could be carried out by various participants, I want to run it at the ux unconf with designers since they are the ones discovering and solving a lot of the web3 ux problems. It would be about giving designers a new web3 tool and to begin the conversation around how they can be used. I do think this workshop should be conducted at the unconf however I don\u2019t see why we there shouldnt be a similar workshop before hand. The more the merrier imo. We could potentially present the outcomes of the first workshop after the conclusion of the 2nd and compare/contrast ideas/outcomes. I am working on the product from Tenzorum and would also love to get involved with the discussion as well.  The web3 ux community usually has discussions on a different forum, we would love for you and others to join the discussion there  http://discuss.conflux.network/   ",

I think its totally fine to conduct both. the Golem presentation is on  EIP-859 challenge outcomes, i think it makes sense for you to go first, and then we have one of the talks. This is not the thread of the unconf so speak with @qnou for that  You are invited to join the ETHBerlin workshop of course, you will have as much voice as anyone else. I spoke with someone from Tenzorum because im having my team check out everything I find however he told me you\u2019re still not ready to open source which is totally fine, however, I can\u2019t work without knowing more, for my workshop. Chose to have the discussion here because my team is familiarized with this forum, and this is about this particular EIP, moreover, as I am organizing the whole of ETHBerlin, I need platforms I am already using, but happy to ellaborate on the UX forum once this is over. This is not a UX discussion, that will take place live, I\u2019m just gathering approaches to be able to form the curated workshop with the community mods. ",
