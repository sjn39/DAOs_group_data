You should now land to a \u201cOverview\u201d page: https://oasis.app/borrow/owner/0xYouraddress  Click on the (+) button on the left-side column.  From there you can add the type of collateral you want, and then borrow DAIs using that collateral.

And what browser are you using? I will also give you some work-arounds for the time being:   If the connection isn\u2019t working with ledger directly, you can also use metamask, and connect your ledger with that: see a how to here: https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020394612-How-to-connect-a-Trezor-or-Ledger-Hardware-Wallet   We\u2019ve recently updated our UI, and it might be that the connection is working on the old UI. You can visit the old ui here: Oasis Borrow   Without connecting: You do not need to be connected necessarily to view your vault. You will need to know your vaultID and then you can view it by going to Oasis.app/borrow/{YourvaultID}   Please reach out to me on rocketchat https://chat.makerdao.com in #oasis to get some direct help ",
