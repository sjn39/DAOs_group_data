Currently, CUs take on legal advisors to suit their own needs, but there is no legal expert for MakerDAO to turn to should \u201cMakerDAO the organization\u201d face a love letter from a regulatory agency, or simply have day-to-day questions. After informally consulting with a variety of legal experts both within and external to the DAO, it seems that there are workarounds to the DAO not being an entity (though they are administratively burdensome for the attorneys involved). Assuming the gymnastics can be done correctly, does MakerDAO want an external \u201cgeneral counsel\u201d or formal legal advisor? I see two main benefits:  This provides someone MakerDAO can ask mundane questions of that are not already covered by a core unit\u2019s legal advisors (like to what extent the Deco Protocol proposal involves non-exempt securities or how we can structure a product in a way to minimize objections from regulators in major jurisdictions). This provides someone ready to begin responses to regulatory letters that often have timelines attached to them, without us having to locate and onboard legal advice under duress.  I see one main downside:  Cost. Good representation does not come cheaply (we would not want Twitter-warrior lawyers).  Cost is also likely to be lumpy, as our needs for billable hours will rise and fall with our legal needs. It may be that even a top-tier practice will not need much of our money, simply because we don\u2019t have many questions and no one is coming after us. It may also be that we incur very large expenses \u2013 though that seems likely to be in the middle of an existential crisis, in which case it is not an expense we can realistically avoid. Additional thoughts and comments welcome in the thread below. Given that this would not be a replacement for CUs retaining their own legal experts as appropriate for their jurisdictions and operations, and also given that there are high-quality practices that come highly recommended that are prepared to work for MakerDAO, do we want a legal advisor for the DAO as an organization?    Does MakerDAO want a legal advisor for the DAO as a whole?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This poll is intended to be a temperature check on whether to pursue a layer of legal representation for the whole DAO. CUs already attend to their own legal matters with representation specific to that CU, and this is not intended to supplant that. ",

Perhaps a DAO-wide general counsel is not the answer. That\u2019s definitely why I wanted to ask people. I will be retaining counsel for myself if not covered by the DAO, however \u2014 it only seems wise. Perhaps that\u2019s what everyone should do. It\u2019s an open question, but does mean the first action against us may legally put individuals and CUs against each other. Seems bad for business. We\u2019re charting a route into new territory.

                    "content": "I have a few thoughts on this thread in general along with specific responses to the comments above. First, as the DAO does not have a corporate form, it will be difficult/impossible to create an attorney-client relationship and thereby attorney-client privilege with outside counsel. Second, I believe concern over \u201cMakerDAO the organization\u201d receiving a regulatory love letter is overblown IF the DAO continues more or less along its chosen path (RWA with regulated intermediaries, etc.). However, the risk of uninvited regulatory engagement increases with a corporate form that can receive subpoenas or inbounds \u2013 e.g., an RWA Cayman Foundation operated by the RWA CU and making investments \u201con behalf of\u201d the DAO. And I\u2019ll comment on Deco, and some of the problems with it, in another thread. Third, I believe every CU should have legal counsel, just as any independent company operating in the general economy has an in-house or outside lawyer they use for various things. Moreover, my practice is to house my MKR in a limited liability company to protect myself for any governance decisions that may be attributed to me because of voting. Of course, I am more risk-averse than most in this regard. Fourth, if we ever onboard a Legal CU \u2013 which should act more as a consultant than actual counsel given the lack of corporate form and inability to represent the \u201cDAO\u201d as a client \u2013  they should run relationships with outside counsel. That\u2019s ideal as you\u2019ll need lawyers to manage lawyers, including costs and work product. Fifth, if the DAO ever considers engaging outside counsel, through CUs or otherwise, focus on the big picture. Yes, good counsel is expensive because it\u2019s worth its weight in gold. Now to some specific comments:     swakya:  Contracting a CU tasked with monitoring legal issues in multiple countries and with discretion in choosing legal counsel fits the current Maker structure better and will probably be smoother operationally.   This would be ideal \u2013 US and EU to begin, with Japan/Singapore next.     PaperImperium:  There are creative ways to fit it into the CU model, though. We can, for instance, have our own law practice. But that\u2019s likely more expensive than hiring outside help as needed.   Perhaps \u2013 though this likely requires counsel to structure the relationship as a consultant and plastering disclaimers about \u201chow this legal advice cannot be relied on\u201d over everything and anything it puts together (memos, emails, opinions etc.). Also, I\u2019m not sure what the difference is between our own law firm and a CU \u2013 and on the former, non-lawyers cannot own law firms if I remember correctly so that cancels out formally owning any firm.     swakya:  Attorney-client privilege when the client is a DAO doesn\u2019t make sense to me. How would it work?   It doesn\u2019t \u2013 the DAO would have a hard time being considered a \u201cclient\u201d by any major law firm.     SebVentures:  What is the problem of having a Legal CU hiring counsel on behalf of MakerDAO? I\u2019m hiring counsel on behalf of MakerDAO with my own entity and it works fine. If you don\u2019t trust the CU for any reason, get rid of this CU to start with.   The problem here is that the lawyers have a relationship with your CU, not MakerDAO. In theory, they can advise you in such a manner as to disadvantage the DAO and, as a result, MKR holders. It requires the DAO to not only judge a CUs performance but basically look past everything they say and do with regard to actions they take, especially on regulatorily sensitive matters. That\u2019s a tall ask for a decentralized group.     SebVentures:  The root of the problem is to get a Legal CU and define how they can be helpful. Imagine you are the Legal Facilitator, you hire a counsel. The first thing he tells you is that we are breaching securities laws, KYC laws and are acting as a broker (I don\u2019t think so, just making a point). What do you do?   Well, a good Legal CU wouldn\u2019t go to an outside law firm without an incredibly deep understanding of the protocol, the latest regulatory developments and how the law as is applies to the protocol\u2019s function. Put another way, we wouldn\u2019t want our Legal CU needing to ask basic questions \u2013 those opinions and positions should be long-formed before they seek outside counsel assistance. But if they encounter such a position in the future, they should seek counsel from multiple places before listening to drastic positions (like seeking a second opinion for a critical medical diagnosis). If the answers are uniform \u201cbad\u201d across the board, they should bring those concerns, along with a means for how to deal with them, to the G&R call, as we do with other problems arising in DAO governance.     PaperImperium:  My immediate thought is a US securities law firm, given the number of letters going out to DAOs and companies from federal and state regulators. Uniswap and Coinbase are not the only ones getting hit, and many of them appear to be out of the blue.   I understand the concern, but I don\u2019t think the sentiment is correct. Yes, these projects have presumably received letters, but all of them have centralized entities that may easily receive subpoenas \u2013 Uniswap Labs, Inc., Coinbase, Inc., etc. These are not DAOs on the receiving end of letters, they are highly organized and well-financed centralized companies, not much different in corporate form then your local McDonald\u2019s, Carrefour, or Caf\u00e9 Havanna. My point is these companies \u201ccentralized\u201d \u2013 which likely has many benefits \u2013 but also brings disadvantages, such as being more open to regulatory action. Now if we heard Banteg got a subpoena in the mail, I would revisit my thinking (and they may have \u2013 Yearn.fi now has a warning about US-based users) but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.

                    "content": "Thank you @PaperImperium for introducing this topic! Generally speaking, I don\u2019t agree with having ONE legal representative / advisor / CU for the DAO.  This makes sense in centralized organizations with top-down hierarchies, but not in a DAO, where no single party should have the power of representing or directing the organization. It also brings obvious centralization risks, which in turn increases regulatory risks. Additionally, it is a very obvious attack vector for legal or regulatory action. Instead, I support the current setup; each CU retains its own counsel, depending on its business model and jurisdiction. I think legal advice should be granular (to avoid centralization risks) and external  (to externalize liability risk associated with legal advice). Several CUs could share one legal resource. Nevertheless, the risk of regulatory or legal actions is real, and we should deal with it now. While the community finds the best way of structuring legal advice/representation, I want to propose  a Self Insurance Fund for MakerDAO. I will elaborate on the details in a later post, but the idea is to structure a fund that covers legal costs in case a DAO stakeholder is the target of a lawsuit or regulatory action. In a second layer, the fund could also cover fines or civil damages ordered by a Court of Justice. The Special Purpose Fund (MIP 55) could be used for this purpose. ",

                    "content": "A few observations from the chain above:     Tosh9.0:  e.g., an RWA Cayman Foundation operated by the RWA CU and making investments \u201con behalf of\u201d the DAO.   The RWA CU does not \u201coperate\u201d the RWA Cayman Foundation. The RWA Cayman Foundation is a stand-alone, orphaned entity that may, from time to time, borrow funds from Maker. The RWA Cayman Foundation has separate director(s) and a supervisor. Maker may lend DAI to RWA Cayman Foundation from time to time and, as a lender, Maker will have an interest in how such DAI proceeds are utilized (similar to a project finance vs. a corporate finance).     Tosh9.0:  Third, I believe every CU should have legal counsel, just as any independent company operating in the general economy has an in-house or outside lawyer they use for various things.   Just as the DAO does not exist as a legal entity, neither do the CUs. I know in the RWA CU, @SebVentures company has to sign engagement letters with law firms. As such the attorney-client privilege only applies to his company. So that I may participate in conversations between @SebVentures and external counsel and have such conversations subject to privilege, I also have a legal engagement letter with @SebVentures company.     Tosh9.0:  The problem here is that the lawyers have a relationship with your CU, not MakerDAO. In theory, they can advise you in such a manner as to disadvantage the DAO and, as a result, MKR holders.   Perhaps, but this does not mean that the CU leads will necessarily accept or follow such advice. It is only advice.     layerzero:  This makes sense in centralized organizations with top-down hierarchies, but not in a DAO, where no single party should have the power of representing or directing the organization. It also brings obvious centralization risks, which in turn increases regulatory risks. Additionally, it is a very obvious attack vector for legal or regulatory action.   Admittedly there may be an attack vector in having counsel \u201crepresent\u201d the DAO. Having said that, if a government wants to attack a DAO, there are probably multiple ways to do so. It seems reasonably prudent to have a platform to respond in the event of such occurrence (or better yet, advise on measures to take in advance to mitigate any such attacks). I think there are a few ways for Maker to have the ability to obtain legal advice from time to time. First, if there is a legal CU, then I recommend that the Legal CU establish a real world entity for purposes of engaging law firms and then preserving attorney-client privilege. Changes in the CU can be easily dealt with in the organizational documents of the real world entity. Of course, if the real world entity shares the legal advice with the Maker community, then entity will lose the privilege with respect to the particular legal advice. This will be a calculated risk made at the time. But it seems useful to have the advice in the 1st instance and then decide how to use it. Second, it is possible in some jurisdictions for non-legal professionals to be part of a law firm. The District of Columbia (Washington, DC) is one such well noted jurisdiction. Tied-up with the real world entity above, there is the potential to set up a Maker focused law firm. This law firm would then contract with other specialist counsel in the US and internationally (as needed). This is a potential possibility. Most common uses are for accountants, etc. to be part of law firms. But it could be something to investigate further (if warranted), although admittedly a bit centralized. Finally, in the event that the community elects to proceed with some form of legal advice, I am happy to give it a hand\u2026 even if only recommending firms, lawyers in other jurisdictions. I have worked in over 40 countries on various transactions and, if I don\u2019t know of a contact, I can certainly find one quickly. Japan is very easy as I worked in Japan for 4 years and Singapore is easy too as my last major role included supervising in-house counsel (and indirectly external counsel) in Singapore. ",
