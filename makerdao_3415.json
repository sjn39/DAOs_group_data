                    "content": "Thank you, appreciate your input. For anyone not familiar with Bancor, there are two key things that differentiate us from other AMMs:  Single-Sided Exposure: LPs can provide liquidity to a pool with single-sided exposure, either in an ERC20 token (\u201cTKN\u201d) or in BNT. Impermanent Loss Insurance: Impermanent Loss Insurance accrues over time, by 1% each day, until 100% protection is achieved after 100 days in the pool. There is a 30-day cliff, which means that if a liquidity provider decides to withdraw their position before 30 days passes, they\u2019d incur the same IL loss experienced in a normal, unprotected AMM. If an LP withdraws any time after 100 days, they receive 100% compensation for any loss that occurred in the first 100 days, or anytime thereafter.  Which I think are attractive to any MKR holders that are currently providing liquidity in other platforms. If the Bancor DAO approves Liquidity Mining rewards then LPs in the MKR-BNT pool will also get BNT in addition to fees generated from trading in the pool. ",
