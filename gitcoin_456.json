For example, this vote was overwhelmingly positive with about 99% of turnout voting yes:     [Proposal] RFC: Transfer $SACKS LP position to Gitcoin Governance Timelock \ud83d\udcdc Proposal Discussion       Support this proposal. I would vote for it.     Even if 1m votes came in against and quorum was reached this would have passed. In these scenarios, given we\u2019re early on in governance and that even with quorum it would have passed, should we simply count these kinds of votes as ratified? cc @monet-supply @Yalor @HelloShreyas and others who participated in the initial thread!

                    "content": "I think quorum thresholds are somewhat less important for Snapshot votes because they don\u2019t directly execute any transfer - a clearly malicious proposal that makes it through with low participation can always be rejected by multisig signers. That being said, it definitely helps give governance a greater sense of legitimacy to make formal procedures/standards for this - Index Coop stands out as a protocol with well specified processes around snapshot voting. A low quorum threshold for snapshot votes should work fine (maybe anywhere from 100k-500k GTC) considering the low security concerns. Maintaining the existing 2.5% quorum requirement for on chain governance is probably best for now, as this has direct control over funds in the treasury. ",
