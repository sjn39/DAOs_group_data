                    "content": "Thanks for coming! Check out the call recording here. It was a great call, mostly focused around what we\u2019d like to see for season 3 grants. Topics discussed:   Season 3 grants  We might want to add more context on the grant proposal template The successful new proposals will likely look different than the proposals in previous seasons This could definitely be something that the elected grants council puts out Lets see some education grants! Maybe a technical content competition Ideally the grants council will take the lead on this by publishing the types of grants that they\u2019d like to see One solution for them is to publish this and then have a community discussion call for feedback    Grant council  Breakdown between Builders vs Growth Experiments subcommittees Do the stated for subcommittees goals make sense? Budget is split the way it is because we are expecting builder grants to ramp up over time, eventually they should converge    Accountability thread  Anyone can contribute to the OP grants through Season 2: where has the OP gone? thread Could even turn this into a competition.    RetroPGF  Some Q&A here on some choices that were made and how it works    If I missed anything or if if you post any follow-up threads, feel free to post it below! Also, those who attended to call recieved a POAP at the end thanks to @Gonna.eth! Make sure to join next call if you want one.  -Michael  ",
