I myself have been building on this network for the past 10 months and now I am in the nomination round for the 10 million OP that are available for rewards next month\u2026 I chose to be really heavily involved with the network on a level where it led me to a whole new opportunity that I never thought was ever possible in my whole entire life\u2026 This was after a long journey of struggling in the space during the early times from the beginning of 2021 until I discovered optimism from the Gitcoin ecosystem and my participation and involvement there\u2026 My earliest mentors in Blockchain education and solidity coding referred me to optimism in July 2021 where I originally submitted my information because I was passionate about the technology and appreciated the values and the ethos of this Network \u2026 The token rewards are going crazy with the other protocols that are here applying for proposals and there are a lot of tokens going out indirectly to people that are not being airdropped so please remind yourself of this when thinking about the overall picture of what optimism is trying to accomplish here in the space\u2026 The model is rewarding those for impact over reward\u2026 So take for instance I have helped to educate people and spread the word about the Network as well as guide others for their proposals here on the governance forums and become heavily involved and fascinated with the way that this system all works as I learn more\u2026 We are now putting all of our effort our energy and our soul into building a layer two NFT marketplace on optimism!!! We are going to create a dedicated Launchpad for creators and also an attestation station for the Fractal Visions platform. There are also other ways to use these NFT platforms like Quix in the past and their token reward system which we have the code for and is totally open source!!! Anybody can choose their destiny and build something amazing for other people to use on layer two!!! We are going to continue to iterate on this model along with our own public goods model for small artists and creators and developers who are part of our ecosystem!!! It has proven to be a very effective model and showing strong growth over the past 10 months!!! ",

Airdrop 2 is designed only valued delegator and gas power user. After Op Quest, all activity data falls and far behind Arbitrum. It\u2019s true that OP Quest attracts a lot of new users to try Optimism network. So OP team needs to find out, which part of users are true loyal to Optimism? I think most of the new users are attracted by clear tasks that you need to collect 10 NFTs for Quest. For Arbitrum, you can play games like beacon, you can trade in GMX. But Optimism ecosystem needs to grow. So for Airdrop 3 , OP team must award all Questers as soon as possible. And launch Quest season 2 at the same time. If no airdrop for OP Quest collector, there will be a huge disappoint for all participators. And all attentions will drawn to Arbitrum or Zksync. ",
