As 2020 ends and the new year approaches\u2014it is time for our community to focus on the recent subject that many of you have been thinking & talking about\u2014full responsibility and ownership of the DAO, and how the community will run the DAO while maintaining network effects, core team talent, and continuous growth. With that in mind\u2014I reflected on what in my opinion is a terrific guideline on achieving decentralization in progressive stages. At the start of the year, Jesse Walden wrote an article called: \u201cProgressive Decentralization: A Playbook for Building Crypto Applications.\u201d There are three (3) components that Jesse outlines as the path to progressive decentralization:  Product/market fit Community participation Sufficient decentralization (community ownership)  I believe the Maker Community can agree that we have achieved step 1, Product/market fit with the popularity of DAI, and step 2\u2014community participation (which is growing stronger and stronger). \u201cWork it, make it, do it, makes us Harder, better, faster, stronger\u201d \u2013Yeezy/ Edwin Birdsong / Guy Christo The next step\u2014and it\u2019s no secret\u2014the DAO will be owned and operated by the Maker Community. We are now moving to Step 3\u2014the most crucial step in the decentralization playbook. The DAO has iterated the steps and the Community needs to be laser focus on the ultimate goal. But, with this goal there are a lot of unanswered questions. Some of the questions already being discussed in this Forum thread started by community member SEB, and he also posted\u2014what I think is a Super Valuable Comment from on one of our most important community members: \u201cThere are opportunities elsewhere that pay better and that don\u2019t involve being micromanaged by forum members. It seems like this process needs to be streamlined if the protocol is to attract and retain talent.\u201d  That comment has really open my eyes & mind about how and what we will need to do in order to retain the core team members that have guided the DAO to Step 3\u2014and also the new incoming talent. However\u2014peace  comes to mind when I think about many of you here\u2014talented people who are super smart \u2014have real world experience\u2014and I know that we will achieve our goals as one core unit. As we start to say good-by to 2020\u2014Maker Community, I hope that you are All laser focus with tunnel vision on the ultimate goal. I hope you are you ready to prove to the World that DAOs can be efficient, organized, unstoppable, and the Maker Community will operate forever. Because we will need you. Every single one of you. This will be fun! -El Pro ",

I\u2019m with the idea that we need to make this a smooth transition, but currently the forum seems to be the main way governance is organized so it\u2019ll be hard to get away from the \u201cmicromanaging\u201d aspect. IMO that means we need to be able to offer competitive compensation for our core team members. With all the SFs accumulating we definitely have the funds, so I think it\u2019s just a matter of getting the forum members to band together and show we are willing to put our money where our mouth is!

I think this is core to a functioning DAO but is definitely a little intangible. From experience, I know corporations often run a month to month or quarter to quarter nomination process for recognizing important contributions. This would be pretty easy to do on the forums in terms of having a thread for submissions and a poll for voting. If we were able to convince the community to add in a small reward for top place finishers, do you think this could be an effective way to both get valuable members paid more and recognize them for their work?
