Our team has spent considerable time this year in getting New Silver\u2019s collateral onboarded with Tinlake and MakerDAO, and as we look to the future, we wanted to solicit some feedback from the community. I have been doing my best to follow the various RWA proposals, and its clear that improving the current legal structure is at the top of the list. I know the Centrifuge and their legal team is hard at work on that, and am confident there will be welcome changes forthcoming. As we look to the future, and with the hopes that our partnership with the DAO will continue and grow, I wanted to focus on a different topic - technology. Our team would like to participate in and expand some efforts next year on improving how non blockchain-native companies like ours can better interact with, and be more transparent, with the community. In that spirit, we wanted to learn where it would be most useful to focus first. We hope the community can provide some ideas and commentary, out of which, our dev team can take on some projects in an open-source environment, where New Silver and hopefully other asset originators can participate in the development and/or usage of these technologies. I put down a few ideas below, but this is by no means a complete list, we welcome feedback on these or other ideas.  Build a transparent collateral reporting tool. This could be an API to blockchain, or an API to UI, reporting from the loan servicer, which would provide near real-time status of each of the collateral loans. Build an automated system for converting DAI to fiat. This could be be a smart contract which interacts with Circle (or similar crypto on-off ramps) and the MakerDAO PSM to automate DAI to fiat exchange for AOs. I have seen mentioned an ability for a trustee to have some on-chain proofs, did not go in depth there and don\u2019t know how realistic or useful that would be.  Not sure if anyone is working on these yet, and if so, we can participate in those projects. Hope to get some feedback on ideas that could be useful to the DAO as well as other RWA asset originators.

                    "content": "One thing I would like to see NS improvise on is attracting the attention of Institutional players. And by that I mean, once we ratified/improve the current legal structure\u2014it would be good to see NS attract institutional graded collateral types. With that focus, I believe it will be necessary to have reporting tools that help such (and the Maker community) keep track of what NS is doing out on the field. I believe in late 2020, I had personally looked into products that allow institutional investors and private equity companies to both manage the performance of Real Estate assets, and to also formulate strategies for the future improvements of those assets. Back then I felt that these available tools would help the community keep track of RE collateral types. With that in mind, if you can create something like a \u201cDebt Module\u201d, that provides a report for performance metrics for the New Silver RE portfolio before and after debt so that we can see the impact of your leverage, and how you formulate strategies on how you utilize debt in financing to maximize your portfolio performance. Perhaps an API that can provide such?  This way both MakerDAO and interested institutional players can monitor data, the movement of data, the transformation of data, etc., that IMO would be super neat. Might be a tough task to build from the ground up, but as you know breakthrough builders change the world. ",
