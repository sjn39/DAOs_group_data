                    "content": "Following on from the Growth CU monthly update, and with the idea of showing what the team is doing, here we bring you the latest news regarding Branding and Communications.  MakerDAO Nature We have already planted 123 trees and we cannot be more proud of what we are generating as a community. The idea is to continue with this initiative until the end of 2022. Also be prepared! Maybe there will be a very special \u201csouvenir\u201d for Devcon to all those who have the poaps corresponding to this campaign. This Sustainable Money campaign is the first of its kind, sustainable money is an umbrella term for monetary systems that are designed to help people. In other words, it\u2019s about creating a system that works for all of us, not only in financial terms but also with the environment.  Argent Campaign We ran a test campaign with Argent which will create the standard for future campaigns we will run with potential partners. Our objective for the campaign is to understand whether for future campaigns we should focus on reaching more users or more DAI volume. For the purpose of A/B testing, in this campaign we focused on attracting more DAI users.  The campaign is raffle draw for Argent users, who stand to get an amount of DAI based on their purchase,  500 winners of $10 ($5k) - deposit at least 10 DAI 100 winners of $50 ($5k) - deposit at least 50 DAI 10 winners of $500 ($5k) - deposit at least 500 DAI  This campaign ran between the 1st and the 14th of August. During this period, Argent sent educational materials to their user base. This are some of the results so far, we are seeing a very high average DAI purchase   Messari Report #1  We collaborate with Messari for the continuous development of reports on MakerDAO, the goal of which is that the protocol is always present on research, and data websites. The report communicates the state of the post Luna Crash protocol, having excellent information related to the advances created in RWA where we are beginning to have a clear market leadership and top of mind. Soon there will have a second report that is an update of another piece they did, you can find that piece here  OP-Ed Strategy One of the pillars of the communication strategy that we are carrying out is to establish MakerDAO and its contributors as communication and knowledge references in the relevant markets and industries (KOL Key Opinion Leaders). For this we are creating a series of op-eds for different media outlets in order to generate a clear idea that MakerDAO is made up of people who know the industry very well. Why are KOLs important? All key opinion leaders are well-known in their respective communities, and their perspectives are regarded and respected. They are seen as true experts, and they are trusted as real people, rather than public figures representing corporations. The first op-ed was published by Nasdaq and written by Teej from RWF Core Unit DeFi\u2019s Role in Bringing Real World Assets into the 21st Century We have a second op-ed on the works written by me soon to be published. I recommend to all those who want to participate, to contact me so we can work together with our communication agency and thus be able to create the right angle of the article according to the general strategy.  Chronicles Release We are working with Nik from Oracles core unit on the Chronicles release plan. This plan includes a series of Press Releases for promotion via media outlets and social media. We are also developing a presentation video with our design agency to generate shareable audiovisual material that reinforces the sense of brand. Soon you will be able to see it!  1600\u00d7792 196 KB   Twitter update Let\u2019s remember how the communication strategy for MakerDAO is based  1600\u00d7837 118 KB  The communication funnel is centered on twitter since it is where most of the industry news happens, and at the moment it is the only intangible asset that Maker Growth owns. The creation of content focused on this social network in conjunction with the interactions obtained is giving us excellent results that are the basis for the assembly of other strategies. Let\u2019s take a tour to understand twitter metrics. Monthly Impressions Impressions on Twitter is a total tally of all the times the Tweet has been seen. This includes not only the times it appears in one of your followers\u2019 timeline but also the times it has appeared in search or as a result of someone liking the Tweet.  Monthly engagement Engagements: Total number of times a user interacted with a Tweet. Clicks anywhere on the Tweet, including Retweets, replies, follows, likes, links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, profile photo, or Tweet expansion. Engagement rate: Number of engagements divided by impressions.  Engagement Rate Twitter\u2019s engagement rate is calculated as the total number of engagements a Tweet receives divided by the total number of impressions on that Tweet  But let\u2019s see what a good engagement rate is  Source: Link It means that we have an excellent engagement rate!!! Regarding the new followers strategy, we are following a 100% organic line, without advertising or specific campaigns of any kind, and despite the fact that we are seeing good numbers, we have prepared some specific actions for the coming months with the intention of directly impacting the number of followers, which together with our high engagement rate can be a fundamental combo for sustained growth.   Brand Research & Web We are currently developing brainstorming sessions to identify why a rebranding of the MakerDAO website would be good to later present a MIP for it. Beyond the obvious reasons related to updating the information available, we are looking to create an identity for the protocol. It does not involve logo changes of any kind, but rather focuses on the communicative aspect and brand presence. Why is a rebrand important? Simple, It\u2019s important because it helps you to stand out from the crowd, and to differentiate from your competitors. It also helps to attract new customers by making them aware of who you are, what you do, and why they should care about your products or services. We are currently speaking with 2 very important agencies in the world of design and communication, one of them with experience in web3 and the other with experience in working with international brands. We will also be contacting contributors from different core units to help us in this collaborative process and thus have a varied input from community participants. First Ideas  |711.75x3691600\u00d7775 110 KB   Media Coverage Here you can find the lastest Media Coverage reports that we work together with our Agecy. It should be noted that apart from the very good impact obtained, we are developing specific relationships with journalists from different media that help us in our task of communicating what happens in the protocol without sensationalism. There are, however, occasions where, in an effort to be the first to post news, certain freelance journalists who are present both on Discord and on the forum take ideas or discussions out of context to create articles with false information or clickbait headlines. In this case, the strategy adopted consists in constant monitoring and specific actions if required. One of these cases was \u201cDai deppeging\u201d, where we spoke with our agency to inform the media that any development in the DAO of this caliber needs to go through the entire formal voting process and are currently just discussions and ideas from a highly active DAO.   June Report   July Report    Front-Ends Situation With the recent news about address blocking by front end providers, we responded quickly with a statement and specific actions with our communication team to bring clarity about the operation of the protocol. Twitter Thread  Final Words I want to emphasize the importance of the way we communicate about the dao and the opinions that we give on social media, since it can hurt our reputation and the work we are doing as a community. If you really want MakerDAO to stand and be the protocol you dream of, please think twice before using words or phrases that can be taken out of context. ",
