We are often above 50% of stablecoin for the last 18 months. This provides no revenues for MakerDAO, provides bad PR and significant counterparty risk on Circle, and to a lesser extent on Paxos; It becomes clear that investing in DeFi Money Markets is not easy to scale (D3M rarely use more than 50M DAI);  Work in this direction was stopped and a potential Core Unit potentially doing this job was never established.   Declaration Detail  MakerDAO governance wish for any party to provide a comprehensive solution to this matter; The whole solution should be under full control of MakerDAO governance through executive votes; Counterparties involved in the operations should be established and reputable companies (using metrics such as Asset under Administration and Asset under Management); The solution should provide a legal structure solution and all regulatory clearances backed by appropriate legal opinions from relevant reputable counsel; While there is no jurisdiction predefined, it is assumed that solution proposals will explain and defend their choices; Any investment structure can be proposed, but as guidance, the expected instruments expected are ETF\u2019s, mutual funds, a portfolio of ETF/mutual funds and/or a managed account with a narrow mandate; If the investment structure is done in an on-chain tokenized way, the rules above will apply to the underlying structure; The investment should allow for being unwound within a week under normal market circumstances (following a MakerDAO executive vote); The investment should, with a high degree of likelihood, be unwindable under stressed market situations within two weeks - potentially at a loss. Different combinations of duration, assets can be proposed, but should be within the following limits :  Average duration up to 2 years; Investment-grade corporate and/or US Treasuries; Maximum 20% of BBB-rated bonds; US Dollars instruments only;   The targeted yield to maturity of the portfolio should be 1% (2-year treasuries?) before structural costs and at least 50bps (3-month t-bills?) after all structural costs (including MakerDAO cost for monitoring);. The targeted size is $1B (for cost structure, investment mandate); The $1B allocation will be gradual; The evaluation criteria will be:  Safety Cost structure Flexibility   Any investment solution selected by Maker Governance will be awarded DAI 1M to finance practical initial implementation (assuming the party is not a MakerDAO CU).

It is intended to be modified significantly during RFC based on community inputs. It is a way to communicate to the broader ecosystem that we are looking for a solution to this problem and are open to suggestions. It is open innovation. If a specific proposal during the RFC period seems to get the community unanimous approval, this MIP might be dropped. The $1M bounty is taken quite arbitrary. I expect legal costs to be in the range of $250k and the legal implementation to be around $100k. I also expect each solution provider to incur costs and most will not be selected. If we had $1B invested at 1%, it would yield $10M per year. Therefore, $1M is not that much considering the opportunity cost we have every month. Happy to have input on that part, if that makes sense at all. My current thinking is that we should invest simply in treasuries with an average maturity of 1.5 years. This would give the 1% yield. The target rate is not that easy to define as we need it to make sense in most environments. My early thinking is that we should generate at least 50bps after all costs to compensate for the operational risk. This is a strong assumption where you could give feedback. I think the operating cost will be between 10bps and 50bps for legal structures, corporate servicers, legal fees, investment management, \u2026 I\u2019ve put people making comments on the draft as contributors, happy to get them removed or add those that I had feedback from (but not in the draft).

                    "content": "I still have not seen anyone (risk, RWA or other) about the prioritization of the following:  Fee return and hence bond pricing risk exposure Laying off the building counter party risk.  My point is that while one may want to get return with longer term bond exposure, given the inflation environment it might be wise to steer far away from anything other than 3month bills and to face the prospect even these might have some rate risk in them to preclude much return.  If anything these may end up costing Maker to have and hence don\u2019t end up being a money making venture but a risk offlaying cost (showing us the true cost of the stables in the PSM btw) Now if Maker is seeking return then going for the longer term notes with the intention to hold them to term (vs off loading them with potentially significant losses to raise cash) might be an option but then one has to consider again not just risks to the protocol but risks to DAI holders that basically these notes end up causing losses to the protocol. The above considerations are why I would like to hear from anyone on the risk or RWA side about what is the key goal.   Lay off counterparty risk, or to earn profit because it is my suspicion how one comes down on the answer to this question is distinctly going to decide the structure of these. In a perfect world Maker would like to have its cake and eat it to, but this isn\u2019t a perfect world and from my seat laying off counter party risk is probably the prime concern.   I have concerns that doing this in any way that keeps DAI holders secure in the $$ value backing DAI will end up costing the protocol money showing us the fallacy that the PSMs are a risk free nor a money making enterprise.   I will be happy to hear from these teams that via some sophisticated low cost techniques we can have our cake and eat it too while also protecting DAI holders. One thing I will say here because I think it is worth merit.   This whole prospect of the 0 fees on both sides of the PSM transactions is flawed we should be building 3-5bps on both sides of these trades for the following reasons:  Frictionless conversion leaves protocl holding an increasingly large bag (62.x% and growing) with zero compensation which will be used and abused mostly by larger players. Takes away fees from things like GUNIV2USDCDAI which in principle could pick up the slack in the middle. Eliminates to some extent any claim that Maker is monopolizing the pricing of risk between the included stablecoins. 3-5bps DAI price fluctuation already occurs across the space, and network fees to access these facilities already are a significant component of the overall fee structure.  Put simply if the network has fees to access, and Maker is incurring costs to manage, then it makes sense to establish minimal fees.  The fact this is already costing Maker to some extent (1M to finance) is illustrative that some fees need to be put on these structures.   Even at 1bps on both sides of the USDC PSM we could have collected 300-500K DAI to fund this adventure. In the end I support this initiative and would like to hear from risk and RWA on a prioritized list of goals here answering the first question posed in my post. ",

The guarantee that you get your money 1:1 for bonds is only valid at the expiration date, and that is only valid for US tresauries, in between there is the intrest rate risk.   This is important. You are 100% right that if we invest in let\u2019s say 2-year treasuries and rates are up 1% and we need the liquidity now, we will take a 2% loss, i.e. 20M over a 1B investment. This is why, even if we have above $5B of stablecoin, I suggest starting only with $1B (and at scale, not at the beginning) This is the cost of having liquidity. It is obviously just an option. One option and potential candidate provided was to use a repo facility to get liquidity. This liquidity pool isn\u2019t designed to be the only one. DeFi money market can be unwind as well. You are also right about the credit risk. But if we look at the FLTR ETF (floating rates corporates) proposed by VanEck (mentioned in October), it lost only 50bps from its peak, compared to a lot more for the 1-3yr treasuries ETF (SHY). And the former was with a better yield/dividend.  image1229\u00d7509 46.6 KB  At the same time, 2-year treasuries will increase in price when there is stress in the market (below is Covid for those 2 ETF). So the ideal is a bit more complicated.  image1236\u00d7528 50.6 KB  It is also the aim of this DoI, to get assets managers that deal which such problems daily to provide us a solution. But if we want to play it safe, both interest rate and credit, I would advise that we do nothing at all. 3-month t-bills were 5bps, now 22bps, still unclear if we could even make a profit after costs. In such a case, we should really consider staying in \u201cregulated\u201d stablecoins. This can also be an outcome of this discussion. @MakerMan  To me, such a strategy is key for the ALM goal of optimizing MKR profitability while keeping DAI safe both on the solvency and liquidity front. But happy to get Risk and RWA view. ",

Let\u2019s move it to 20% (which should allow a blend of 50% very short corporate bonds + 50% 2yr treasuries), it should be enough for the proposal. I can move it to 0% altogether, but in such a case, we will reduce the diversification benefit of having credit risk vs interest rate risk.

There may also be times where Maker Governance has already discussed possible solutions to a problem and already aligned on an implementation to a point where they would accept only that specific implementation.

My thinking is regarding the issue of liquidity in the PSM, and I think the targeted size should be a function of the amount of stablecoin assets in the PSM rather than a fixed number.   The reasoning behind the $1B is that I\u2019m quite confident it will not pose an ALM issue even with the development of RWA and Institutional Vaults this year. It is nevertheless big enough to get access to almost everything (there were talks about being able to get a custom ETF at that size) and be large enough to make sense for complexity and cost structure. I\u2019m not 100% confident that we will even get a $1B allocation this year. There are plenty of challenges here: studying jurisdictions, finding willing high-level corporate servicer(s), performing KYCs with many parties (which can take months). I also believe that the current smart contracts will not work for such an amount (this is only a personal opinion). Then some testing and waiting for a Lindy effect. Then we need to discuss about the counterparty risk. The idea could be profitable at a lower amount, but less profitable assuming some fixed costs. And by less profitable, it means we might need to take more risk just to bear the costs. But again, I don\u2019t know the cost structure yet, it is up to the solution providers to figure that out. I will progress on the ALM front while solutions are presented/implemented and present ideas on how much we should keep in PSMs (the excess being allocated in this strategy). ",

Monetalis MIP6 - Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation   We are also engaging in discussions with leading asset managers who have expressed interest in managing a MakerDAO bond liquidity fund, including Blackrock, PIMCO, Fidelity and Goldman Sachs Asset Management   Our DAI supply is 67.4% from stablecoins (up from 60% at the time of writing this MIP) and our revenues base is falling, the urgency is therefore quite high. I\u2019m therefore formally submitting this MIP and willing to help anyone that is working in this direction. ",

                    "content": "We represent Backed Finance AG (BF), a Swiss company that has developed a fully compliant solution for issuing tokenized versions of tradable securities, including short-term bond ETFs. Switzerland has long been at the forefront of developing innovation-friendly regulations to foster the growth of an ecosystem with a strong and well-understood rule of law. Most recently, in August 2021, the Digital Ledger Technology Law (DLT) came into effect, allowing the existence and transfer of digital asset securities on permissionless venues. BF\u2019s solution is based on the issuance of tokenized structured products under Swiss law, fully-backed by the underlying bond ETFs in a dedicated collateralized account, via its fully owned subsidiary, that acts as the issuer, Backed Assets GmbH (BA). That would allow MakerDAO to gain exposure to short-term bonds without having to offramp crypto to fiat or leverage any real-world structures at all. In our view, this should be Maker\u2019s endpoint for asset-liability management: onchain permissionless tokens, fully collateralized, that provides exposure to asset classes outside pure crypto. BA has filed and received approval for a Prospectus by the Liechtenstein FMA, for both professional and retail investors within the EU/CH. The project has been in the works for approx. 18 months, backed by reputable investors, and is state-of-the-art for TradFi infrastructure in a friendly jurisdiction.
