Summaries reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. @MakerMan is retiring as a Delegate to focus on personal projects, while Delegate @Doo_StableLab has stepped down from the Growth Core Unit to concentrate on his Delegate duties. 2. @rune proposed a \u201cunified DAO toolkit\u201d for implementing nearly automated transparency, while @Hasu proposed a simpler alternative to the Endgame Plan. 3. Recognized Delegate @ultraschuppi made an interesting proposal for jumpstarting vault usage by slightly increasing the percentage fee applied when trading a stablecoin in exchange for DAI using the PSM.   News and Announcements  Endgame Decentralized Voter Committee Meetings: Wednesday, June 29, 9 pm CEST and Thursday, June 30, 9 pm CEST  Rune announced the agenda for both June 29th and June 30th DVC calls! June 29th\u2019s call discussed the DVC concept, renaming of these concepts, and focus objectives for Core Units. Additionally, CES presented the current state of collateral onboarding and their opinions on priorities and focus objectives.  Watch the recording here.  Check out CES\u2019 slide deck on the current state of collateral onboarding here.   June 30th\u2019s call will focus on delegates and delegation.   Join here at 19:00 UTC.   Announcement - At end of term MakerMan will be retiring as a delegate.  \u201cWhat has been created on Ethereum, I believe, has all the core elements to make a better world (both from a financial perspective, but also from a governance and people one).\u201d Due to recent events, @MakerMan has announced that he will be stepping down as a Delegate to focus on writing a whitepaper for a personal project.  Doo_Upcoming Resignation from Maker Growth Core Unit  @Doo_StableLab announced that he would be stepping down from his position as a member of the Growth Core Unit to focus more of his time on Delegating work, minimizing conflicts of interest, and lightening the load on the Growth CU\u2019s budget. The Growth team is now looking for a replacement; contact @Doo_StableLab, @joce_chang, or @nadia on the forum if you know someone who might be a good fit.  A Farewell to Lending Oversight  @luca_pro made a farewell post about the project they\u2019ve been leading in recent months: the Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE), aimed at \u201cdeveloping state-of-the-art frameworks for internal checks and balances, acting as an additional line of defense within the DAO, and helping to educate the community.\u201d While the proposed MIP39c2-SP33 did not pass, @luca_pro took the opportunity to reiterate his dedication to the Maker community and thank the many fellow DAO members who supported onboarding the LOVE Core Unit.  Meet Your Delegate #16 - pvl  Meet Your Delegate #16 with Delegate candidate @pvl will take place on July 7th at 3 pm UTC. Learn more about @pvl\u2019s background in their platform, which will also be presented before the Q&A section of the event.

Active Discussions  Unified DAO toolkit: Making transparency easy  Rune made a post responding to concerns that DAO members will no longer be allowed to talk to their colleagues under the Endgame Plan. He argues that we should have \u201cmaximum reasonable transparency\u201d regarding the work Core Units are engaging in. All significant work interactions between independent Core Units must be carried out publicly and fully documented according to standardized procedures. Achieving this kind of transparency can help Maker achieve several goals, including:  Measuring results and evaluating performance in an unbiased way Ensuring the security and integrity of processes and documentation to avoid critical operational risks in the event of a Core Unit disappearing Verifying that free-market processes set the prices paid by Maker and that Core Units aren\u2019t accidentally or intentionally creating vendor lock-in or monopolization  Rune proposes a \u201cunified DAO toolkit\u201d to achieve this level of transparency. This kit would comprise a software tool used for workflow tracking, similar to Jira or Trello, and a wiki-like governance information dashboard. These two components combine governance and operations under a single system and allow for built-in transparency for \u201cfree.\u201d  Simple MakerDAO \u2014 Governance from first principles  Recognized Delegate @Hasu made a post outlining a series of governance changes to address many of the issues MakerDAO is currently facing. While he believes Rune\u2019s Endgame Plan contains some good ideas, he wanted to provide a simpler alternative for the sake of competition. Hasu believes that Maker struggles with a lack of long-term vision and strategy and needs to find solutions for two primary issues going forward: 1. Maker\u2019s identity crisis Multiple questions have been debated by the community for years\u2014and are still being debated:  How much emphasis should we put on MKR holder profit vs. operating as a public good? What is the right balance between decentralization and efficiency? Should Maker stay isolated to crypto or expand to the real world? Should we continuously burn MKR vs. burning MKR tactically? Is Maker a bank? What is the right shape for MakerDAO (the organization)?  Hasu believes we must develop a unified vision for where Maker should be headed. 2. Maker\u2019s governance crisis @Hasu argues that MKR holders and Delegates are overburdened and are expected to vote on every proposal without the adequate knowledge (due to the growing size and complexity of the Maker organization) or incentivization to do so.  The proposal for solving these problems involves two main components. 1. Creating a Constitution This Constitution would nail down a long-term vision for MakerDAO by defining:  Maker\u2019s vision and North Star The rights and responsibilities of key stakeholders within the system Maker\u2019s mandates (e.g., make money for MKR holders, create the most liquid decentralized stablecoin, and become the cheapest source of credit)  Benefits include:  Creating a rock-solid foundation of the underlying principles of Maker; the constitution defines those parts that are explicitly not subject to frequent change and from which other decisions (e.g., strategy or tactics decisions) derive Encoding in writing what we can\u2019t encode in smart contract code Creating a yardstick against which all other parts of the decision supply chain (delegates, council, MAs, CU members) can be held accountable Cleanly separate the what (vision, goals) from the how (strategy) so they can be discussed and decided on individually   2. Establishing a Council of Makers The main goal of this component is to provide the strategy level of the governance decision-making chain with its dedicated role. The Council could be tasked with:  Setting a high-level strategy to reach the goals laid out in the Constitution Setting and allocating a budget Managing bigger DAO transactions like buybacks, dividends, DAO-to-DAO partnerships, and token/debt offerings  Specialization would be encouraged to avoid complications arising from the local knowledge problem.  Some implementation details and an impact outlook are available in the full post.  Governance Security Module (GSM) Adjustment [Informal Poll]  This Informal Poll aims to gather sentiment from the community on how to adjust the Governance Security Model (GSM) Pause Delay, which is designed to give MKR holders a chance to review all earmarked changes to the Maker protocol for malicious intent before the changes are enacted. Some community members believe the current delay of 48 hours is too short.  Can we justify the existential risk posed by PSM-USDC?  \u201cIf the DAO continues to exist at the will of Circle/USDC, then we need to justify it. If we can\u2019t justify it, we need to change it.\u201d Recognized Delegate @ChrisBlec made a post airing his concerns regarding the amount of DAI generated from USDC in the PSM and its associated risks. Pointing out that Circle, which issues DAI, has the power to \u201cblacklist/freeze the USDC in the PSM without notice,\u201d he believes we need to act immediately to develop a plan for mitigating existential risks introduced by this and similar situations. With this post, ChrisBlec is:  Requesting that CUs use this as a safe space to offer some realistic modeling & scenarios (PE, legal, any other relevant takes) regarding precisely what would happen if all USDC in the PSM got blacklisted/frozen. Asking staunch PSM supporters to justify the risk that the scenarios presented in Step 1 become a reality. Asking us to decide, as a DAO, whether or not the reasons to keep the PSM in its current state (or at all) are worth the risks and justifications that have been established.  Several suggestions were provided in the comments, including a well-thought-out reply from @monet-supply:  619\u00d7822 142 KB  Post note: Joao, USDC product lead at Circle, has responded to the thread by introducing his own thoughts on the topic.  Rethinking PSM-fees  Currently, fees for exchanging stablecoins for DAI (and vice versa) using the PSM are set at zero. This makes it easy to arbitrage using the PSM: If DAI is trading at $1.01, users can convert their USDC to DAI and sell it for a 1% profit. At the same time, native-crypto-backed vaults are losing momentum, with the appetite for leverage in the crypto market at a historic low. Furthermore, Maker recently reached its all-time highest stablecoin ratio at 80%. In light of this situation, Recognized Delegate @ultraschuppi believes it may be a good idea to raise the tin slightly\u2014the percentage fee applied when trading a stablecoin in exchange for DAI. If the tin were raised to 1%, for example, this would make it so that arbitraging the depeg is only possible by minting DAI using real collateral, boosting vault usage.  Questions about MIP47 multisigs & Makershire  @ChrisBlec made another post with some unanswered questions about MIP47, which covers how MakerDAO multisigs work, and its relation to Makershire. If Makershire passes, 10,000,000 DAI belonging to MKR holders and entrusted to MakerDAO governance will be transferred to a 5-of-7 multisig. ChrisBlec believes the following questions must be answered for Maker to be acting responsibly and that the Makershire proposal (if passed) should be delayed until they are settled:  What rules, processes, and security will be utilized during the multisig ceremony? Will the ceremony be in-person or virtual? How will the rules, procedures, and security be enforced if virtual? How can the DAO be assured that the private keys and/or mnemonics securing each of the seven signing keys were generated clandestinely, have been infallibly secured throughout their existence, and were not compromised before being designated as a multisig signer? How will the community multisig signers prove to MakerDAO that the multisig keys are not being held in a hot wallet like Metamask (as has happened with numerous other multisigs)? What ongoing measures will MakerDAO be able to take to ensure that any future compromise of a multisig signer\u2019s wallet becomes known to the DAO the moment that it happens? Who will be legally and financially responsible if five of the seven multisig keys are compromised, and the funds are stolen (as has happened with numerous other multisigs)? If MakerDAO governance decides to cancel Makershire and revoke the funds, what assurances does the DAO have that the multisig signers will act in the DAO\u2019s best interests and return the funds? What measures are being taken to counteract the financial incentive that five of the seven community multisig signers have to collude, steal, or fake a theft from the multisig (as has happened with numerous other multisigs)?   [BEAR] CU Facilitators: Transparent and Proactive Cash Management  In a post related to this Signal Request, @adcv asks Core Units to:  Confirm the accuracy of actual expenses reported in the below on-chain snapshot Confirm on-chain snapshot of cash on hand and intent to return excess DAI to the DAO Provide an expense forecast through Q3 End (June, July, August, and September) Return all excess cash over three months of monthly forecasted spend  More aggressive returns that could be possible due to underspend relative to budget will be greatly appreciated     820\u00d7592 82.6 KB   820\u00d7592 82.6 KB   [Open-Discussion] What could be potential reasons for Donut switching from DAI to USDC for their Save program?  @TRUEMAKER wants to know why DeFi investing app Donut has chosen USDC over DAI for their \u201cSave\u201d program. @dbkcan questioned whether New York state\u2019s recent stablecoin guidance may have led to the change, but @TRUEMAKER pointed out that \u201cDAI is allowed in NYS too,\u201d so the mystery remains. If you have an insight or idea into why Donut made the switch, share it in the comments.  SHCU | Reflections On Recent Events: A LOVE Letter  \u201cIf the path forward is centralized, hierarchical system control, Maker may be a successful enterprise, but it is not the vision I signed up for.\u201d @aburban90, Facilitator of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, made a post regarding what they view as a potentially coordinated effort to pass the proposal to onboard the LOVE Core Unit, almost enabling a \u201cmove towards centralization.\u201d They cite that close to one-third of MKR participated in the vote: \u201cWhere did all these new \u2018Yes\u2019 votes come from?\u201d  Thoughts on Multichain DAI Liquidity Strategy  @monet-supply published an in-depth post about the growing activity on non-Ethereum and layer-2 chains and how this momentum could affect DAI. The post calls for Maker and its community to take a more proactive approach to generate and safeguarding liquidity on external domains. After a detailed explanation covering why DAI liquidity across domains is beneficial for Maker, the current mechanisms used to support cross-chain liquidity, and important KPIs and metrics, monet-supply outlines some ideas for improving DAI liquidity across the blockchain space:  Liquidity incentives: It could make sense to pursue limited scope incentives to bootstrap DAI liquidity on external domains and get it to the point where DAI markets become self-sustainable through organic usage. Partnerships: Maker can partner with external protocols to support DAI liquidity and integration within their apps. Community Visibility: Because these users can maintain their existing custody scheme (e.g., using a hardware wallet or setting up a multisig), they don\u2019t face the same governance and custody risks that MakerDAO itself would when deploying assets cross-chain. Sharing these opportunities more accessible way could help increase DAI adoption without direct costs to the DAO.   [Informal Poll] DAI borrowing incentive ideas that the DAO could test?  This informal poll seeks to gather interest in ideas the DAO should test to incentivize DAI borrowing for new wallets. The options are:    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  [BEAR] Building Financial Resilience & DAO Targets  June 23rd\u2019s Governance and Risk call dove into the cash flow forecast that was followed by discussions on various scenarios to calculate Maker\u2019s runway in the event of sustained unprofitability. In response, Strategic Finance is asking whether MKR holders should be able to guide targets for bear-market expense cuts through on-chain polls? If so, then these on-chain polls would be framed as follows: \u201cWhat target level of Recurring Net Protocol Income profitability (defined as rNPI / Recurring Revenues averaged over a preceding three calendar month period, excluding MKR vesting and liquidation income) should the DAO set to drive budget cuts?\u201d  Positive (> 5%) Break-even (\u00b15%) Negative (minimum three years of runway at any time) No change   1757\u00d7670 118 KB  This Signal Request ends today! Final Vote Breakdown:  1680\u00d7797 142 KB   Signal Request: LP our AAVE and ENS with ETH on Uniswap v3  In response to MakerDAO\u2019s receipt of a large quantity of ENS tokens after last year\u2019s ENS airdrop, this Signal Request gauges community sentiment about LPing Maker\u2019s AAVE and ENS in the treasury with ETH. Selling airdrops may reflect poorly on MakerDAO; putting them to work in liquidity pools may enable Maker to generate additional revenue from the ENS airdrop without jeopardizing community sentiment or rendering MakerDAO ineligible for future airdrops. About $90k in stkAAVE tokens are also currently unutilized. This Signal Request will run until June 30th, 2022. Current vote breakdown:  1707\u00d7742 165 KB   1707\u00d7742 173 KB   Immediately Onboard BUSD & Introduce 0% PSM  This urgent request is to expedite a MIP6 & PSM launch for BUSD to diversify DAI\u2019s collateral backing. Maker currently holds a majority of exposure to USDC. If Circle (USDC) is underwater for whatever reason, our entire collateral base could default. In response, @aburban90 is asking the community to immediately onboard BUSD as collateral, which will be used as a temporary alternative in an effort to phase out USDC or at least diversify the risk of collateral defaulting. However, Andrew will likely have to create a new request using the MIP6 collateral application template; as mentioned here. The Signal Request will run until July 9th, 2022.

Summaries reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.  Online PDF Version available here.  Authors: @nothsa, @alec, and @artem_gordon   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. @AstronautThis\u2019s calculations show that the current Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold is safe, but the community may want to consider disabling the ESM anyway. 2. The Risk Core Unit has announced v3 of the Maker Risk Dashboard, adding support for Vault type, PSM, D3M, oracle, liquidation, and whale data. 3. Tickets for the Daivinity party at EthCC in Paris are available. Reserve yours here!   News and Announcements  Announcing Maker Risk Dashboard v3  The Risk Core Unit recently made a post announcing v3 of the Maker Risk Dashboard. In addition to a new design, new pages for Vault type, PSM, D3M, oracle, liquidation, and whale data have been created.  For this third iteration, the team has:  Redesigned the website to provide a better and more accessible user experience Abstracted data, concepts, and models to reduce complexity and simplify the dashboard Added new features to provide access to data not previously available in v2   DAIvinity EthCC Paris Tickets  If you\u2019re planning to attend the Daivinity party at this year\u2019s EthCC, message @Leggevents on the forum or comment in this thread to be allocated a pre-release code. The event will take place at Bridge Club in Paris on July 19th with doors opening at 21:00.   twitter.com    \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83d\ude80DAIvinity\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 @Daivinity  eventbrite.ca/e/daivinity-ti\u2026   5:53 PM - 6 Jul 2022           13             Meet Your Delegate #16 - pvl  @pvl will be presenting their Delegate platform and hosting an AMA on July 7th at 3 pm UTC. Among other things, @pvl hopes to help Maker integrate the following as DAO practices:  Web3-native intelligence for protocol stewardship, collateral onboarding, and treasury management Provably optimal infrastructure funding mechanisms Web3-native community support tools  Zoom Link Meeting ID: 896 9599 0453 Passcode: 838320  Meet the Dai Foundation Board during EthCC  The Dai Foundation board will be hosting an in-person community meeting during this year\u2019s EthCC for anyone interested in learning more about the Dai Foundation.  Unfortunately, tickets are currently sold out.  MakerDAO Actual Expenses vs Budget - May 2022  @adcv of the Strategic Finance Core Unit posted the May update for monthly Core Unit expenses and a forecast for the subsequent three months. In summary:  DAI expenses were up to 3.2M in May, 0.6M lower than forecasted. Forecasted expenses are expected to stabilize to around 3.7M/month by June, a 44M annual run-rate. Oracle gas expenses continue to trend lower due to decreased network congestion, as well as OCU\u2019s work to minimize them.     MIP41c4-SPxx: Immunefi Security Core Unit Facilitator Onboarding - IS-001  @psychonaut has been added as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security. In his own words, @psychonaut explains: \u201cI have worked as Deputy Facilitator for Immunefi Security since its inception on Dec 2021 and, during part of its incubation period under SES, two months prior (Oct and Nov 2021). I have taken charge of the accounting, written status updates, and contributed to our core unit\u2019s goals. Our current Facilitator, @travinimmunefi, continues to lead with long-term strategic planning but is stretched thin by his many other responsibilities. This MIP formalizes what is essentially already the status quo.\u201d  Guidance on how to specify Copyright in software produced for MakerDAO  A new document outlining how to attribute copyright for MakerDAO software is available here. The document covers how to assign copyright to the Dai Foundation, the guardian of MakerDAO\u2019s intangible assets, and how to ensure copyright information is visible on GitHub.   Active Discussions  [Informal poll] Disable the Emergency Shutdown Module  The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) enables a minority of MKR holders to shut down the protocol by depositing enough MKR to reach the ESM Threshold, currently set at 150,000 MKR. In a possible attack vector opened up by this mechanism, an attacker could short the MKR token, trigger the ESM, and close their position once the MKR price drops. The ESM Threshold should be set so this attack would be unprofitable. Using a series of calculations, post author @AstronautThis demonstrates that given the amount of MKR available for borrowing on other protocols (among other methodological assumptions outlined in the full post), the current ESM Threshold is high enough to make such an attack unprofitable. Given that: 1. There is currently no consensus surrounding the situations that would merit triggering the ESM, and 2. in a crisis, MKR holders are more likely to sell their MKR than deposit it in the ESM to be burned, it may be worth considering the question of whether we need an ESM at all. Should the ESM be disabled by community consent? If the protocol did need to be shut down, it would be subject to the GSM Pause Delay, currently set to 48 hours.  Questions for Core Units about intangible assets - for review and comment  @sorenpeter of the Dai Foundation made a post compiling a list of budget- and ownership-related questions for the community to ask when a Core Unit MIP has been posted as an RFC. The goal is \u201cto ensure that there is focus on avoiding that single operators can control important MakerDAO assets and communication channels.\u201d Some of the questions include:  Have you acquainted yourself with the Dai & Maker Trademark Policy, so you know how to utilize the Dai, Maker, and MakerDAO names and logos? Which types of tangible and intangible assets will you produce with the funding from MakerDAO? Will the assets produced using MakerDAO funding be available as public goods for the whole DAO?   [Vault-Discussion] NonSC Crypto-Backed Loan Optionality  Continuing the ongoing discussion surrounding the PSM and its collateral, @TRUEMAKER made a post and informal poll to center dialogue around finding an optimal balance between on-chain and off-chain collateral. @TRUEMAKER proposes shifting focus to ETH-based vaults to increase the volume of non-USDC-backed assets, thereby lowering the percentage of USDC-backed assets. In particular, they propose introducing a \u201cvault-holder optionality\u201d feature that would give users a one-time annual option to transition between same-currency vaults, which differ in collateralization requirements and stability fees.  Potential Benefits  A higher ratio of DAI generated from ETH/BTC; less reliance on USDC/RWA Increased vault duration and retention Pricing optimizations that include a more defined range between ETH-based vault types Align pricing with evolving market conditions in a formulaic way A better customer experience leads to longer-term and/or higher-use customers Incentivizes new vault creation Reduction in loan defaults of bad debt  Potential Risks  Temporary stability fee reduction Lower liquidation fees Coding execution leading to faulty migration   End-Game Summary - Part 3  To aid his understanding and increase the accessibility of the ideas for everyone, @LongForWisdom posted a summary of Part 3 of @rune\u2019s Endgame Plan. The structured, bullet-pointed summary:  Stresses the simplicity of the process Points out budget challenges as the primary area of concern Highlights the need for best practices to achieve a general separation of powers  MetaDAOs may be the best way to compartmentalize this risk   Introduces ideas around DAO2DAO operations  Under this model, CUs would no longer be companies or groups hired directly by Governance, but as a service provided by MetaDAO\u2019s to Maker.    Follow @LongForWisdom\u2019s Endgame Index List for a listing of Endgame-related posts and @LongForWisdom\u2019s summaries.  Proposal of END Capital to be Attestor for Bank Participation Vaults  END Capital has expressed interest in becoming an \u201cAttestor\u201d for Maker, dealing with underwriting responsibilities and fiat on and off-ramps for DAI. In their own words: \u201cOur END Capital team has over 40 years of combined experience originating, underwriting, and investing in asset-backed loan portfolios in aggregate totaling in excess of 500 million transactions.\u201d  Unified DAO toolkit: Making transparency easy  In this post, @rune argues that we should have \u201cmaximum reasonable transparency\u201d regarding the work Core Units are engaged in. All significant work interactions between independent Core Units must be publicly and thoroughly documented according to standardized procedures. @rune proposes a \u201cunified DAO toolkit\u201d to achieve this level of transparency. This kit would comprise a software tool used for workflow tracking, similar to Jira or Trello, and a wiki-like governance information dashboard. These two components combine governance and operations under a single system and allow for built-in transparency for \u201cfree.\u201d   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Surprisingly, there are no active signal requests at the time!  image1477\u00d7727 76 KB    Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual. Recognized Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.  Online PDF Version available here.  Authors: @nothsa and @artem_gordon   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. The Strategic Finance Core Unit released a MakerDAO financial report for June. 2. MIPs have been submitted for offboarding both the Strategic Happiness and Immunefi Core Units. 3. The Oracles Core Unit submitted an innovative budget proposing a voluntary budget reduction in exchange for one year without further cuts. Bonus! Keep an eye out for a Forum update by DUX about the Delegate Contract Migration feature on the Portal, coming soon!   News and Announcements  Financial Report 2022-06  The Strategic Finance Core Unit has published its MakerDAO financial report for June.  Summary Overall Net Protocol Income was 6.7M DAI, +33% from May and -23% from June 2021. Annualized ROE on a rolling 6mo basis has begun sliding from 70-80 toward 30-40%.  After-effects from rapid deleveraging in Q2 continue to ripple through the crypto economy (LUNA \u2192 Celsius \u2192 3AC \u2192 etc.) ETH/BTC prices continued their decline throughout June  ETH/DAI: 1,955 to 1,024 WBTC/DAI: 31,611 to 18,718 This has driven a substantial amount (impact of -1.4M DAI) of the decline in recurring revenues as vaults liquidated and users covered positions   Collateral locked is also in sharp decline as major institutional users exit lending amidst broader market deleveraging  ETH locked in protocol from \u039e2.2M to \u039e1.5M WBTC locked in protocol from \u20bf34K to \u20bf63K driven by vaults protecting positions; as of 11-Jul-2022, collateral is back to \u20bf39K (due to Celsius loan repayment)   Total interest income decreased from 4.3M to 2.4M (-44%) month on month Overall income up on liquidations from a volatile month \u2013 from 8.6M to 9.5M (11%)  The full report is packed with data, visualizations, and insights.  MIP41c5-SP9: Facilitator Offboarding (SH-001) and MIP41c5-SP10: Facilitator Offboarding (IS-001)  MIPs for offboarding both the Strategic Happiness and Immunefi Core Units have been submitted by @CodeKnight and @Ippy, respectively. Subproposal MIP40c3-SP76, @CodeKnight explains the motivation for offboarding Strategic Happiness. In short, the proposal\u2019s supporters believe the Strategic Happiness Core Unit represents an unnecessary expense during the bear market, noting that its budget tripled during the last approval cycle and was already contentious before the bear market began. GovAlpha posted an impact analysis in the comments:  844\u00d7267 67.4 KB  Subproposal MIP40c3-SP77 offers similar reasoning, arguing that offboarding the Immunefi Core Unit and engaging contributors\u2019 services on a contractual basis is a preferable alternative expected to result in more than 12,000 DAI per month in personnel cost savings.  Off-Chain Proposal Bounties Round Up #1  The first monthly summary of winning governance authors and initiatives for the Off-Chain Proposal Bounties initiative has been published. This initiative aims to incentivize the submission of concrete governance proposals by distributing rewards in DAI to authors of successful Signal Requests and MIPs. The current monthly reward pool is set at 6,000 DAI. While there were many successful Signal Requests, MIPs, and Subproposals in June\u2014more than in both April and May\u2014none met the eligibility criteria, and no rewards have been distributed via this initiative yet.   DAO Resilience Improvement Initiative \u2013 Status Update  The DAO Resilience Improvement Initiative, now a joint effort of the DUX, GovAlpha, GovComms, and SES Core Units, aims to achieve two primary goals:  Improve the DAO\u2019s financial and operational resilience Experiment with emergent vision and strategy for MakerDAO  This status update covers some changes to the format of the initiative and outlines some of the current work being done. The original format of the initiative presented several challenges:  Timing: With the bear market coming, \u201cforceful short-term developments have overtaken sustained efforts of continuous improvement.\u201d Meeting fatigue Lack of sustained coordination and buy-in from multiple participants: Difficult to achieve with an initiative started by a single Core Unit  To address the last issue, SES has recruited several other Core Units to get involved with the initiative to focus on decentralized operations, which encompasses tasks such as:  Organizing and improving the decentralized governance processes that drive MakerDAO operations Improving the signal of what MKR holders want to prioritize and providing them with the tools to express which direction they support Developing mechanisms to build and maximize consensus about MakerDAO vision and strategy, combined with effective execution  Current work in progress includes a vision alignment questionnaire for Delegates and a collaborative project with Stanford Professor of Political Economy and Political Andrew Hall.  Announcement: Delegate Migration  The upgraded Governance Portal is set to launch today, July 14th. Delegate contracts are nearing expiry and require action from both delegates and their delegators. Your MKR will never be at risk during the migration; however, you are strongly encouraged to migrate if applicable. The DAO\u2019s delegation system is based on VoteDelegate smart contracts, which expire annually by design. These expired contracts cannot participate in governance, though any deposited MKR can still be withdrawn - even after expiry! Governance Portal The DUX CU has developed a new Governance Portal feature that informs users when action is required and facilitates the migration process for delegates and delegators. A successful migration establishes a link between the old and new owner address, which is used to aggregate participation metrics (profile markdown, performance, vote, and comment history). The goal is a smoother, more intuitive UX for all delegates and governance participants. Steps for Delegates   Prepare a different owner address for the new delegate contract (note: the new owner address cannot already own a delegate contract). Whilst connected with the current delegate contract owner address, submit the new address in the migration flow and wait for confirmation by DUX CU. Switch to connecting the new address to the Governance Portal to resume the migration process. Generate a new delegate contract. Migrate any of their own delegated MKR, and encourage their delegators to migrate.   Steps for Delegators When delegating MKR to a new or expired contract, delegators will see a banner at the top of the Governance Portal prompting them to migrate their delegation. Check your active delegations from their head to the \u2018Migration\u2019 page. This page lets users check if any of their delegations have expired or renewed. They can then easily undelegate and redelegate between the active options.   Active Discussions  [Informal Poll] Voluntary Budget Adjustment in exchange for 1 Year Guaranteed Budget  Last week, the Oracles Core Unit submitted an interesting budget proposal. Discussion surrounding ways to lower expenses during the bear market, including especially many different proposals for modifying Core Unit budgets, has taken center stage in recent months. With this in mind, the Oracles Core Unit has cut its proposed budget by 10% compared to last year\u2019s budget. Given the uncertainty around the budget situation, the team has included a clause to avoid having its budget cut beyond this self-imposed 10%: If the reduced budget is approved, the Oracles Core Unit will be exempt from further budget reductions for 12 months. Alternatively, the proposal offers voters the option to vote for the same budget as last year but is subject to any DAO-wide cost-cutting initiatives that may be implemented in the future. With this post, @Doo_StableLab aims to gauge community support for this proposal and the potential benefits of applying it to other CUs. He also provides a set of pros and cons:  Pros  Cuts costs Gives CUs the freedom to choose where to cut within their budget More certainty (and thus better planning) Fairer if the same amount cuts all CUs   Cons  As this functions as a budget cut and a budget freeze, CUs\u2019 function might decrease Might be unfair for CUs that run lean budget requests compared to CUs that request more than they actually spend If the cut rate is the same across CUs, CUs are disincentivized from cutting more than the set rate, even if they have the ability If the cut rate is the same across CUs, some CUs might not be able to withstand the cut if their initial budget is already very tight   End-Game Summary - Part 4  @LongForWisdom has released Part 4 of their ongoing summary of @rune\u2019s Endgame Plan. These summaries are intended to:  Help get @LongForWisdom\u2019s head around the Endgame Plan so they can form an opinion on it Improve accessibility of what is an incredibly complicated set of concepts and proposals  This post covers MetaDAOs (key aspects, types, and related profit opportunities), increasing MakerDAO\u2019s Layer2 penetration, getting Maker \u201cinto the metaverse,\u201d and tokenomics.  Delegate Office Hours - Includes poll for discussion topic  Delegate Office Hours will take place this Thursday at 4 pm UTC. The discussion topic will be decided in advance by vote:  1700\u00d71182 168 KB  Zoom Link Meeting ID: 882 8655 0832 Passcode: 690611  Should governance polls include a Gantt chart?  This informal poll is intended to gauge interest in requiring the inclusion of Gantt charts, which display all the tasks constituting a project, in governance polls.  Requiring this inclusion would give voters an easy way to get a sense of a proposed project\u2019s roadmap and its highest-priority tasks, as well as provide an indication of how well thought out the proposal is and the team\u2019s readiness to execute it. So far, the \"No\"s have a healthy lead.  [Informal Poll] Restructuring Incentives for Recognized Delegate Compensation  This informal poll by @aburban90 continues the ongoing discussion on Recognized Delegate compensation. @aburban90 believes the current incentive structure is poorly designed and offers several new mechanisms to improve it. The proposed mechanisms are:  Weighting compensation by how long a Delegate has been a contributing member of the community Requiring Delegates with a single large source of backing to be transparent about their funding sources Requiring Delegates to stake their own MKR as collateral to be eligible for Delegate compensation Adding MKR in addition to DAI as part of the Delegate compensation package   Ideations and Suggestions for Growth at Scale  @Shravanrajas published some ideas to help MakerDAO achieve growth at scale.  Remove barriers that prevent growth by understanding and actively benchmarking MakerDAO\u2019s comparative advantage by defining and benchmarking KPIs across growth pillars Payments  Benchmark and target payment providers Create a robust framework or template to identify the Minimum Viable Economy to enter and scale organic DAI adoption   Product development for existing partners  Identify where DAI utility is stagnating across existing partnerships and find out why Collaborate to create growth roadmaps for partnerships with high ROI    Check out the full post for more suggestions and further details.  Doo_Thoughts as a Hawk Delegate  Recognized Delegate @Doo_StableLab published a post sharing his thoughts on the ongoing discussion around Core Unit budgeting. Arguing that community members are more willing to adjust budgets as the bear market deepens, @Doo_StableLab wants to make it clear that \u201chawks arguing for cuts\u201d are aware of the potentially disruptive effects budget cuts can have on Core Unit contributors and their projects. The hawks\u2019 motivation can be summed succinctly: \u201cResources are finite, and without proper accountability, the protocol will not have enough resources to allocate to crucial initiatives.\u201d The post closes on an optimistic note: \u201cI am confident that there are enough minds on both sides to make compromises and have civil discussions.\u201d  Survey Makerdao CU employees on their workplace satisfaction  @CodeKnight made a post concerning surveying MakerDAO Core Unit members about their workplace satisfaction and requesting a Core Unit to own the project. Potential questions to include are being proposed by community members in the comments. Feel free to share your suggestions!  [Informal Poll] Transcriptions and Editorials for Publicly Recorded Calls  @Artem_Gordon of the Governance Communications Core Unit posted an informal poll to gauge community sentiment about whether the GovComms transcription and editorial program justifies its costs, which currently range from about 2,500 to 3,500 DAI. The program\u2019s value proposition saves stakeholders time and provides a historical written archive of DAO activities. So far, most voters believe the program is worth continuing, with several pointing out that written records make searching for information significantly easier.   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Reset delegation metrics for Hasu  Recognized Delegate, Hasu, requests to reset his delegate participation and communication scores presented in the monthly delegate round up. Hasu explains that his inability to attend previous votes has made it difficult to recover his score because delegate scores consider the lifetime performance of that delegate. This request surfaced lots of attention and mixed feelings; some people agree that Hasu\u2019s score should be reset with the hopes that he will improve it. However, other people express that this can set a poor precedent and is unfair to previous delegates who could not participate in delegation due to emergencies and were still unpaid or had their scores hurt. A common proposal mentioned throughout the responses is to revaluate delegation metrics and work with GovAlpha to improve on that to help all delegates instead of just one. Prose11 from GovAlpha responded by announcing that they are currently working on defining the delegate role and plan to submit a MIP, which will be posted in the next few weeks. This vote ends on July 23, 2022. Current Vote Breakdown:  1705\u00d7807 177 KB    Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual.

Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. lyt\u2019s in-depth look into the MKR token provides several metrics surrounding governance that point to increasing levels of decentralization. That said, the study also found that it currently only takes the three largest entities to dominate a given vote. 2. The Growth Core Unit\u2019s recent update explores a framework to continue expanding DAI\u2019s market share with a proposed shift from unsecured or undercollateralized loans to more traditional lending structures. 3.

MIP65 Sub-project: Tokenization / Community Feedback Request  Part of the plan for MIP65: Clydesdale includes investing 250M DAI in two BlackRock/iShares ETF short-term US Treasuries products. In this post, @AllanPedersen asks for feedback on the idea of including securitization and tokenization of the underlying ETF products, providing a second layer of security and getting MakerDAO\u2019s foot in the door as an active participant in regulated security trading markets in both Europe and the US.

MKR Token Decentralization Views  @lyt provided a well-illustrated analysis of how decentralized the MKR token really is. Different metrics yield different conclusions, but some of the highlights include:  The number of possible effective voters (defined as MKR holders with at least 1 token) has decreased since April 2021 but is in a long-term uptrend The current Gini coefficient of the MKR distribution is 96.75, representing high inequality While the voting power of the single largest holder has been declining, it still takes just three entities to dominate a vote   766\u00d7334 22.5 KB  The post closes with a poll on whether MKR decentralization reports should be posted regularly and, if so, with what frequency.  Scaling with clarity  @ClausClowes shared an idea for implementing an \u201cinformation digestion system\u201d to better manage the amount of information DAO members are responsible for keeping up to date on. The idea involves the creation of the \u201cMoogle\u201d role, in which impartial correspondents in charge of a particular area of the DAO serve as the go-to source for information on their chosen area.  \u201cCode is Law\u201d vs. \u201cBankruptcy Law is Law\u201d  In this post, @christiancdpetersen explains how the US Bankruptcy Code\u2019s \u201cautomatic stay\u201d provision pushes back against the well-known \u201cCode is Law\u201d maxim often espoused in the crypto world. This provision prohibits \u201cany act to obtain possession of property of the estate or the property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate,\u201d a stipulation that may one day butt heads with MakerDAO\u2019s automatic liquidation mechanism.   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Reset delegation metrics for Hasu  Recognized Delegate, Hasu, requests to reset his delegate participation and communication scores presented in the monthly delegate round up. Hasu explains that his inability to attend previous votes has made it difficult to recover his score because delegate scores consider the lifetime performance of that delegate. This request surfaced lots of attention and mixed feelings; some people agree that Hasu\u2019s score should be reset with the hopes that he will improve it. However, other people express that this can set a poor precedent and is unfair to previous delegates who could not participate in delegation due to emergencies and were still unpaid or had their scores hurt. A common proposal mentioned throughout the responses is to revaluate delegation metrics and work with GovAlpha to improve on that to help all delegates instead of just one. Prose11 from GovAlpha responded by announcing that they are currently working on defining the delegate role and plan to submit a MIP, which will be posted in the next few weeks. This vote ends on July 23, 2022. Current Vote Breakdown:  1700\u00d7855 178 KB    Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - GovAlpha-Core-Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa  Online PDF Version available here.    Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. A Signal Request aims to gather sentiment regarding which path the DAO should take in implementing budget cuts: a broad cut that treats all Core Units the same way, or a tactical reallocation that allocates capital based on merit. 2. The Starknet Engineering Core Unit is nearing completion of Maker Wormhole, which will enable fast L2 to L1 withdrawals, and is seeking approval of associated risk parameters in preparation. 3. ChrisBlec opened a poll gauging support for requiring Recognized Delegates to prove their uniqueness to deter any efforts to game the quadratic compensation payout system.   News and Announcements  Governance & Delegation \u25bc  Wednesday and Thursday 9pm CEST DVC Meeting, topics and links  As usual, this week\u2019s Endgame Decentralized Voter Committee (DVC) meetings will be held on Wednesday and Thursday at 7pm UTC. Wednesday, 7pm UTC: Zoom Q&A about various forum posts and recent feedback; clustering discussion continues. Thursday, 7pm UTC: Zoom Continue the clustering and transition discussion started during last Thursday\u2019s meeting.  Decision to Delay Today\u2019s Executive till Friday 29th  The Wednesday, July 27th Executive Vote has been pushed to Friday, July 29th, to provide extra time for running tests, reviewing code, and coordinating with the RWF and LTS Core Units.  Core Unit Updates \u25bc  Monthly Core Unit Updates | June 2022  The round-up of Core Unit updates for June was published last week by @Artem_Gordon. Nineteen Core Units published updates, a new record that means 95% of all active Core Units now post weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly updates.  Short take: return of excess funds (~2M DAI)  The Real World Finance Core Unit has returned just over 1.99M DAI to the Maker protocol, citing a responsibility for Core Units to mitigate the effects of bear market budgetary constraints.   Dashboards and Resources \u25bc  StratFi Query / Dashboard Directory  The Strategic Finance Core Unit has released its dashboards and queries on topics from stablecoins to oracle gas fees to the public.  939\u00d7347 34.7 KB   Collaterals & RWAs \u25bc  Short take: Exciting news and opportunity for RWA teams  The Real World Finance (RWF) Core Unit has completed all necessary work for onboarding Societe Generale - Forge and Huntingdon Valley Bank Vault types. With this work complete, the RWF Core Unit will now focus on spinning off a new RWF Core Unit centered on the North American market. The original RWF Core Unit will begin to transition toward becoming a MetaDAO. The community can track the spell code and executive vote contents on GitHub.   Active Discussions  Charting a Path for RWAs Part 2: The Maker Standard  Following Part 1, Charting a Path for RWAS - The Case for Continuity, this post by @teej is broken down into three main sections:  Case: Why are RWAs, in fact, core to the protocol\u2019s success?  To constrain our collateral base only to crypto assets would be like exporting only to risky, highly volatile, and non-diversified markets while ignoring those markets and sectors that will generate the highest and mostsustained demand for DAI.*  Long-Term: What is the long-term vision/strategy for RWAs?  The Maker Standard is the gold standard for how real-world collateral is onboarded into DeFi. It\u2019s a protocol for RWAs.  Short-Term: What short-term strategy facilitates the pathway to long-term success?  Unlock novel asset classes\u2026bring traditional credit markets onto the Maker Standard.  Request to Poll for Maker Wormhole Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters  In preparation for finalizing work on MIP69: L2 to L1 Fast Withdrawals, the StarkNet Engineering Core Unit is requesting to poll the community on various risk parameters to ensure that a vote on deployment can take place once Maker Wormhole is ready at the end of August. The parameters are: Debt Ceiling Parameters  Set the Starknet Debt Ceiling parameter to 1M DAI Set the Global Debt Ceiling to 3M DAI as a sum of all debt ceilings for each domain; the current Global Debt Ceiling is set to 2M (1M for Optimism and 1M for Arbitrum)  Wormhole Fee Parameters per Domain  Set the Starknet Wormhole Fee parameter to 0  Approve Oracle Quorum of 13 feeds  This is the minimum number of feed attestations required to complete a Fast Withdrawal transaction and will be comprised of any of the 25 Oracle feeds provided by the Oracles team   MakerDAO Blog Update & Discussion  @Artem_Gordon submitted a poll asking the community what should be done with the makerdao.com blog, which is currently not being utilized to its full potential.  Leave the blog unused.  The status quo carries on until the stars align.  Onboard a marketing CU that will eventually manage the blog.  Conceptually, this is the best option. The caveat is the amount of time it will take for such a team to come about: Minimum, six months; maximum, unlimited.  Persuade Growth or Brand to take on this responsibility.  May require the adjustment of mandate or budget.  Persuade GovComms to take on this responsibility.  May require the adjustment of mandate or budget.  [Informal Poll] Sybil resistance for Recognized Delegates  @ChrisBlec points out that because Recognized Delegate (RD) compensation is paid out based on the quadratic formula,  RDs are incentivized to create multiple RD accounts, thereby boosting their total compensation. This informal poll aims to gauge sentiment about requiring Recognized Delegates to prove their uniqueness, thereby removing this incentive.  [Informal Poll] What is the upper limit on how many CUs delegates can effectively oversee?  This poll submitted by @CodeKnight asks the community what they think the upper bound is for the number of Core Units Delegates can realistically oversee. The \u201c6-10\u201d option currently leads 57% of the vote.  Request: Scientific risk calculation of entrusting protocol-owned funds to 3rd party multisigs  ChrisBlec called for a risk calculation regarding entrusting MKR holders\u2019 funds to different L2 blockchains, sidechains, and dapps secured by third-party multisig wallets. He argues that because the security profiles of these wallets are unknown, entrusting funds to them is reckless.  Endgame: Different starting point for DVCs  @ClausClowes shared their thoughts on the hawk-dove working prototype currently in place for Decentralized Voter Committees. He argues that having just two primary groups creates a reactionary relationship of codependency that could be avoided by introducing a third group and asking the community for feedback and ideas.  Delegate Office Hours #4 - Includes poll for discussion topic  Delegate Office Hours #4 will take place on Thursday, July 28th at 4pm UTC. The Budget Re-allocation and Core Unit Accountability Framework Signal Request (read our summary below) is currently leading the weekly topic poll. Zoom Link Meeting ID: 882 8655 0832 Passcode: 690611   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Budget Re-allocation & Core Unit Accountability Framework  Should the DAO use a broad-based cut or tactical reallocation process to adjust budgets? During the July 20th, 2022, Decentralized Voter Committee meeting, the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF) presented two options for the DAO to choose between adjusting budgets and returning to breakeven operating cash flow:  1035\u00d7715 407 KB  Option 1: Broad Cut has the advantage of requiring little overhead to be executed quickly and effectively. It has the disadvantage of treating all Core Units equally, regardless of performance or existing spending patterns. Option 2: Tactical Reallocation, recommended by SF, involves allocating budgets based on merit. This option avoids treating Core Units identically but will require much more time and effort to implement, relying on the development of an evaluative framework and KPIs to estimate the performance of each Core Unit.  Vote Breakdown:  1710\u00d7972 183 KB   This Signal Request will run for one week rather than two, given the urgency triggered by market conditions.  2022-07-23T17:00:00Z\u21922022-07-30T17:00:00Z   Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - GovAlpha-Core-Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual.

The original wording could have been interpreted as suggesting that any changes resulting from this process could have entered directly into an Executive Vote, which is incorrect.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa and Artem Gordon  Online PDF Version available here.    Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. Wednesday\u2019s Executive has been postponed while GovAlpha waits for clarifying communication from a trading firm that has expressed concerns about MakerDAO compliance. 2. A popular proposal for project-based budgeting with the aim of giving more control to MKR holders is likely to be discussed during Thursday\u2019s Delegate Office Hours #6. 3. The Risk Core Unit published an overview of the potential market impacts and risks associated with the upcoming Merge.   News and Announcements  Governance \u25bc  New Additional Appointment to MIP Editor - @Gala  @prose11 announced that he had appointed a second MIP editor: @Gala. @Gala already has experience with most of the duties required of MIP editors, and having two officially appointed editors should help ease the workload as the amount of MIP-related content increases.  Announcing Governance Dashboard v2  GovAlpha announced a new and improved version of their Governance Dashboard. New features include:  A new Sankey Diagram to visualize the current MKR delegation flow from the main delegators to delegates. Support for fullscreen charts. Support for delegate contracts expiration. A new delegates section was added. And more!   Postponing Scheduled 2022-08-09 Executive  Tomorrow\u2019s spell has been delayed while Governance waits for a response from a trading firm that has expressed compliance concerns regarding swapping the most recent batch of 25M DAI for USD. The plan going forward is to prepare a spell to be issued at the end of this week if clarifying communication is not received in a timely manner.  Core Unit Offboarding \u25bc  MIP41c5-SPxx: Facilitator Offboarding (SF-001)  As part of the ongoing offboarding of the Strategic Finance Core Unit, this MIP sub proposal is for offboarding the Core Unit\u2019s current Facilitator, @aes.  Updates and Initiatives \u25bc  Dai Foundation position on Patent infringement complaints against MakerDAO  Noting the prevalence of patent trolls who make vague, baseless claims on MakerDAO\u2019s intangible assets, @sorenpeter of the Dai Foundation explains in this post that the Foundation will only utilize resources for reviewing complaints that appear to have \u201ca clear risk of losing control/ownership of MakerDAO intangible assets.\u201d  100 Days to zkSync 2.0 Bridge Deployment  zkSync 2.0, the second general-purpose zk rollup after StarkNet, is targeted for launch in about 100 days. This post by Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PECU) Facilitator @Derek announces PECU\u2019s intention to deploy a canonical DAI contract to the chain before launch. While not as simple as deploying to Optimism or Arbitrum, this project is expected to be much simpler than the StarkNet DAI bridge. PECU plans to carry out and publish a detailed risk analysis to the forum that is expected to reveal a risk profile similar to StarkNet\u2019s.  image1034\u00d7538 97.2 KB   ELI5 DAI Backing  To help community members stay informed, GovAlpha\u2019s @LongForWisdom launched a new project to create simple sentence and paragraph summaries explaining each of DAI\u2019s backing assets, including RWA. Several community members have already stepped in to provide asset descriptions and share feedback about the project.  Endgame Plan \u25bc  Wednesday and Thursday Endgame DVC Meetings: Presenting Endgame v3  In this week\u2019s Decentralized Voter Committee meetings, @rune will continue to present v3 of the Endgame Plan, covering topics such as tokenomics simplifications, new terminology, and details about Phoenix Stance. Rune believes the Endgame Plan has reached a simple enough format to hold a vote soon. Wednesday, 7 pm UTC Zoom Thursday, 7 pm UTC Zoom  Spanish Translations \u25bc  MakerDOCs en Espa\u00f1ol  The Ambassador Program presents to the Latin American community a series of MakerDAO technical documents, which have been translated into Spanish. However, due to technical circumstances, the documents weren\u2019t uploaded on the official site, docs.makerdao.com. Instead, the team uploaded the files to Notion. This issue will be remedied in the near future.   Active Discussions  A Message to Maker - CP, Eric, and Teej  In this post, @teej makes a detailed argument for why he believes that he, Eric, and CP\u2014the small team that has been taking care of much of Maker\u2019s RWA management\u2014should continue to lead RWA going forward, suggesting that Maker should \u201cdouble-down on those who have lived and breathed within it for the last year\u201d rather than attempting to build a new RWA team from scratch.  Delegate Office Hours #6 - Includes Poll for discussion topic  Delegate Office Hours #6 is set to retake place on Thursday at 4 pm UTC. \u201cProject Based Budgeting Proposal\u201d (see our summary below) is currently leading the weekly topic poll. Zoom Meeting ID: 882 8655 0832 Passcode: 690611  1340\u00d71552 182 KB   Project-Based Budgeting  In this post, @juan proposes a new form of budgeting based on project-based funding to allow MKR holders more control over the MakerDAO workflow. By having MKR holders vote directly on which projects they want to see built, a significant amount of control and oversight would be shifted to the stakeholders over individual Core Units and their workforces.  1035\u00d7675 198 KB   Proposal to incentivize the closure of all vaults/PSM with USDC  This post from @cryptenthusiastic proposes increasing rates charged to users with open Vaults and PSMs containing USDC to incentivize their closure.  Proposal for the avoidance of possible future sanctions  Another proposal from @cryptenthusiastic aims to gather sentiment around implementing a way to regulate or block wallets suspected of laundering money using DAI or engaging in other illegal activities to mitigate concerns about MakerDAO being hit with sanctions. So far, this proposal has received little support.  Merge Risks and Market Impacts  This piece from the Risk Core Unit outlines the possible market effects and risks involved with the coming Merge and potential network forks. Topics covered include:  Futures backwardation and negative funding stETH discount External asset fork choice Liquidity pool protocols Oracle networks and indexes Network downtime Replay attacks   Partial collapse of civilization due to climate catastrophe is now locked in  @rune shared his thoughts on the potential for climate-related civilizational collapse and whether \u201ctotal collapse\u201d can be prevented even if \u201cpartial collapse\u201d is inevitable.   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  N6M Target Spend Level  This post aims to gather sentiment regarding MakerDAO\u2019s Target Spend Level\u2014the maximum amount spent excluding gas\u2014for the next six months. Setting an official Targeted Spend Level sets the tone for the budgeting process by ensuring stakeholders have a committed target during the planning phase. Community members are invited to study the Strategic Finance Core Unit\u2019s forecast when weighing options ranging from <$10M to >$17.5M.  1035\u00d7300 61.6 KB  Forecast assumptions:  No change to current crypto collateral rev run rate 5% increase in RWA O/S excluding HVB HVB fully ramped by October MIP65 fully ramped by November Bond Arranger #2 fully ramped by February Makershire Redux approved   Signal expires on August 16th.   Current Vote Breakdown:  1702\u00d71470 275 KB   Update MANA vault stability fee to 3%  Instead of being offboarded with other unprofitable collateral, the MANA Vault\u2019s stability fee was increased from 3% to 6% last year in order to meet the $300k/year cost of the oracles. Today, MANA Vaults are far from unprofitable, generating net revenue of $600K per year for MakerDAO. In light of this change, @cazala would like to see the MANA stability fee lowered to the ballpark of other collateral types such as LINK and MATIC, which have stability fees of 2.5% and 3%, respectively, despite having similar liquidity issues to MANA as well as low usage, net negative revenue, and higher risk premiums.  Signal expires on August 22nd.

To achieve this, governance will need to approve a change of the wallet address in the RWA Foundation portal with Genesis Global from RWA Jar to RWA Urn.  Core Unit Announcements \u25bc  New Additional Appointment to MIP Editor - Gala  GovAlpha Core Unit Facilitator @prose11 announced the appointment of a second MIP Editor, @Gala, to help manage the increasing amount of MIP-related content.

Request for Poll: StarkNet bridge deposit limit and StarkNet teleport fees  The StarkNet Engineering Core Unit is requesting to submit a poll regarding updating two parameters of the Starknet Maker Teleport deployment to facilitate the initial liquidity of a new AMM. The proposed changes are:  Setting the StarkNet Teleport Fee parameter to 1 BP to align with Optimism and Arbitrum Increasing the bridge deposit limit from 50 to 1000 DAI   Intangible Assets and Asset Transfers \u25bc  Makerdao.network has now been transferred to Dai Foundation, Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management - 2022-08-17, and Intangible Assets as Public goods - questions for Oracle Core Unit  The makerdao.network domain has been transferred to the Dai Foundation, cementing its status as a public good for the DAO. Additionally, Core Units can now act as content managers (to have their email own provider specified) for a subdomain that identifies that Core Unit. Existing users of subdomains are now listed in the Asset Registry and will stay on as grandfathered-in Content Managers of the assets.

Topics include:  DAI regulation  Any asset which pegs to fiat currency will be strictly regulated. Any issuer of such stablecoins will be regulated and licensed. Dai and Maker will be outlawed if they don\u2019t follow the requirements. These regulations will be very difficult to comply with without a centralized structure.   Real-world assets  RWAs will bring regulatory troubles and costs to Maker.     Lower ETH/WBTC stability fees to reduce USDC reliance and attract more borrowers  Recognized Delegate @mhonkasalo made a post outlining a proposal to set some vaults\u2019 stability fees to 0% to draw investment away from the USDC vault in the wake of the Tornado Cash sanctions. This move would also allow Maker to investigate the effects of large adjustments to stability fee rates.  Governance Voting Incentive Campaign  Events Core Unit Facilitator @PonJerry posted a plan for increasing the participation of small MKR holders in Maker governance using a voting incentive campaign. The idea is to leverage the high demand for DAIvinity tickets by offering them as a reward for participating in governance voting. Potential benefits include:  An increase of <50 MKR holder participation Promotion for people to procure MKR and start participating in governance voting Increased social media chatter about MKR voting Drawing more social media attention to Maker generally Better representation of MKR holders at DAIvinity events    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Changing USDC-PSM fees  As USDC-PSMs continue to operate without fees, @ultraschuppi expresses his concerns. Setting Stability Fees to 0% has been signaled in October 2021 to encourage vault holders to mint DAI from crypto collateral. Still, it hasn\u2019t helped the stablecoin ratio, instead cutting deeper into our revenues. However, if we were to soft-peg to the USD, vault holders might have an opportunity to achieve arbitrage gains, thereby increasing their utilization. In response, ultraschuppi proposes to increase both the \u2018tin\u2019 and the \u2018tout\u2019 on the USDC-PSM and asks the community what bps these parameters should be set at.

Current Vote Breakdown:  1730\u00d71700 257 KB   1725\u00d71657 226 KB   Update MANA vault stability fee to 3%  Instead of being offboarded with other unprofitable collateral, the MANA Vault\u2019s stability fee was increased from 3% to 6% last year in order to meet the $300k/year cost of the oracles. Today, MANA Vaults are far from unprofitable, generating net revenue of $600K per year for MakerDAO. In light of this change, @cazala would like to see the MANA stability fee lowered to the ballpark of other collateral types such as LINK and MATIC, which have stability fees of 2.5% and 3%, respectively, despite having similar liquidity issues to MANA as well as low usage, net negative revenue, and higher risk premiums.

It was more the bureaucrat in me to also add the tout option, not because I advocate for doing that. The previous pre-SR discussion has not gained real traction so I wanted to keep things going and used the SR to facilitate a vehicle for those who want to reduce the USDC exposure. ",

Authors: @nothsa  Online PDF Version available here.    Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. The Protocol Engineering Core Unit team released a roadmap covering progress and plans for expanding Maker to L2 blockchains like Optimism and StarkNet. 2. In Delegate news, Jason Yanowitz submitted his Delegate Platform, @yano + @Matt_NZ participated in Meet Your Delegate #18 on Monday, and Delegate Office Hours will be taking place on Thursday, as usual. 3. @rune published a draft long-form version of his Endgame Plan version 3, which includes all the material covered during the last several months on the DVC calls.   News and Announcements  Governance \u25bc  Jason Yanowitz Delegate Platform  Jason Yanowitz (@yano) published his Delegate Platform on Monday. Jason is the founder of the crypto media website Blockworks and hosts the Empire podcast. His core values include:  Maker is a B2B (or DAO-to-DAO) platform that can serve as the backbone of DeFi Maker should focus on expanding DAI\u2019s market share by building connections with more protocols, both inside and outside of Ethereum Maker must improve its governance and incentives by balancing pragmatic governance with the pressing need for long-term decentralization  Key Info Name: Jason Yanowitz Forum: @Yano Discord: Yano#4805 Website: blockworks.co  Meet Your Delegate #18 - @Yano + @Matt_NZ  The latest Meet Your Delegate session took place Wednesday, this time featuring new Delegate candidates @Matt_NZ and @Yano.       Delegate Office Hours #8 - Includes Poll for discussion topic  The next Delegate Office Hours will be held today at 4 pm UTC. MIP55c3-SP8: Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund is currently leading the weekly topic poll, but not many voters have turned out yet.  838\u00d7716 62.6 KB  Zoom Meeting ID: 882 8655 0832 Passcode: 690611  Mandated Actors \u25bc  Offboarding MIP7c3-SP4 Domain Team Mandated Actors  This post announces the resignation of Mandated Actors Brian McMichael (@brianmcmichael) and Chris Mooney (@cmooney) as smart contract domain team members in their roles as Mandated Actors. They will continue contributing as contributors and advisors to the Protocol Engineering Core Unit.   Active Discussions  6s - Arranger Perspective - Part 1, Part 2, Part 3  The 6s Capital team published a three-part series sharing their perspective on what it means to take on an \u201cArranger\u201d role at MakerDAO.  1035\u00d7582 40 KB  As an Arranger, 6s aims to serve as a \u201ctransaction engineer\u201d to help cement new Real World Asset (RWA) deals, rather than as a standard \u201cdeal closer\u201d following a rigid checklist. This means iterating on different implementations until a satisfactory solution is found and collaborating fruitfully with other DAO contributors.  Endgame Plan v3 complete overview  @rune published a very comprehensive thread covering his latest version of the Endgame Plan, which has been in discussion throughout the last several weeks during the bi-weekly DVC Calls. The thread examines topics such as Meta, Meta Engineering, MetaDAOs, MetaDAO tokens, EtherDAI, various collaterals, and much more.  Layer 2 Roadmap - History and Future  Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PECU) Facilitator @Derek published a Layer 2 (L2) roadmap outlining the team\u2019s progress and plans for implementing Maker products on L2 solutions. PECU\u2019s primary near-term goal is to finalize work on the L2 \u2192 L1 fast withdrawals project, which will enable L2 users to withdraw DAI from L2s to the mainnet Ethereum chain much faster than is possible by default. This feature is expected to be finalized by the end of the month for Optimism and Arbitrum and by the end of September for StarkNet. Once fast withdrawals are enabled, the next steps include:  Full teleport: Fast withdrawals between L2s Minting DAI on L2s Extending multi-collateral DAI to other L2 collateral types   Who Speaks for DAI Holders?  @Eumenes made a post asking a series of questions focused around one big question: Who speaks for DAI holders? Some of the questions include:  How big is the demand DAI market? What is its revenue potential? Why do demand DAI holders own DAI? Can Maker better focus on both understanding and meeting the needs of this key segment of DAI holders?  Check out the full post for Eumenes\u2019 explorations of these questions and some interesting comments from the community.  [Brainstorming] Product features & ideas for organic DAI growth  @TRUEMAKER shared some ideas for boosting organic DAI growth during the bear market:  Hybrid crypto-backed vaults: Stacking coins  This idea involves allowing users to borrow DAI by stacking staked and unstaked ETH with wBTC in a single vault.   Free-vault opening: Cover gas fees  This idea aims to boost DAI adoption by introducing no-fee borrowing.   Governance Polls: DAI gas fees  This idea involves allowing gas fees for governance-related activities to be paid for with DAI.      Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  MKR Pro-Rata Vesting Community Sentiment Poll  This Signal Request aims to gather sentiment regarding compensating former RWF-001 members @Eumenes and @teej with a prorated amount of MKR for their work as part of the Core Unit. The pair spent more than 3,000 hours onboarding, negotiating, and structuring Real World Assets for MakerDAO. They are seeking approval for this pro-rata distribution of MKR tokens. This approval will indicate to GovAlpha/RWF-001 Facilitator to proceed with the necessary spells for the distribution of 73.32 MKR to Teej\u2019s Ethereum wallet and 48.1 MKR to Eumenes\u2019 Ethereum wallet.

The amendments aim to clarify the types of loans that fall under each loan category and were triggered by several discussions with Ankura Trust Holdings, the calculation agent. A poll to ratify the changes will occur on Monday, September 5th. As @prose11 explains, a poll is being used over an executive vote to give the community plenty of time to consider the proposed changes and ensure that Recognized Delegates will have a chance to present their views on the topic.

Topics covered in this post include recognized launch MetaDAO clusters, the MIP0 Endgame amendment, an optional LDO-to-MKR swap MIP, collateral onboarding special mandates, Protocol Owned Vault emulation activation, and budget reduction. Yesterday\u2019s DVC call held by Rune discusses this MIP set.  The Path of Compliance and the Path of Decentralization: Why Maker has no choice but to prepare to free float Dai  Another post from Rune explains his views on why DAI should free float away from USD at a \u201cstable, predictable rate that feels like negative interest rates.\u201d In short, Rune believes that implementing free floating DAI reduces the number of \u201cattack surfaces\u201d available to any regulatory bodies that may, at some point, seek to crack down on MakerDAO. The Endgame Plan\u2019s MetaDAOs and Protocol Owned Vaults can be leveraged as tools to implement this plan.  Endgame Plan timeline to free-floating Dai  In relevance to the discussion mentioned above, this post by Rune explores the approximate timeline for the different events and phases of the Endgame Plan.  1035\u00d7568 122 KB   Engineering \u25bc  Bridge hacks review and learnings for Maker teleport  In this post, the Core Facilitator of the StarkNet Engineering Core Unit @pyramidmaker provides an overview of what the team has learned by studying the top nine bridge hacks and how this knowledge can be applied to the Maker Teleport project. The key takeaways were:  Rollup due diligence:  Lack of decentralization in different contexts Declaration of ad hoc design changes and procedures Clarity around the access rules and management of critical pieces of infrastructure   Development and deployment processes:  Nothing should be deployed without a prior audit Public GitHub repositories can leak critical information System affecting authentication and verification Limit ad hoc processes    The following steps include implementing a circuit breaker for pausing minting on L2s and setting up risk parameters, such as withdrawal limits. A recent Executive Proposal has passed on September 1st at 06:00 UTC, which included the Maker Teleport Launch on Arbitrum and Optimism.  Real World Assets as a Vampire Attack on Crypto  In this post, @brianmcmichael of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit explains why he believes the implementation of RWA at Maker is harming DAI and \u201cdraw[ing] value from Dai holders and return[ing] it to the TradFi industries we are trying to disrupt.\u201d  1035\u00d7531 49.4 KB    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  ALL SIGNAL REQUESTS END TOMORROW, SEPTEMBER 2ND!

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa  Online PDF Version available here.    Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. @LongForWisdom made a detailed post sharing his views on the underexplored potential risks of the Endgame Plan and how these risks might be mitigated. 2. Recognized Delegate @twblack88 has started a weekly open call aimed at compiling actionable feedback from Decentralized Voter Committee calls and making sure that feedback is posted to the relevant Endgame-related forum threads. 3. Onestone\u2019s Recognized Delegate Platform\u2014emphasizing growth, stable revenues, a data-driven mentality, and unbiased collaboration\u2014has been published. Bonus! Check out this Week\u2019s Relay for a quick update on everything merge-related at Maker.   News and Announcements  Weekly Relay | Merge Work at MakerDAO  This week\u2019s Relay, written by @alec, highlights what Maker\u2019s Core Units and teams have been doing to ensure the protocol continues to operate smoothly in the wake of the now successful Ethereum Merge.  Onestone Delegate Platform  @TRUEMAKER has released his Recognized Delegate Platform, Onestone. His primary objective as a Delegate are be to advocate for growth initiatives that will boost DAI adoption and increase MKR value. Core values include:   Growth, as mentioned Developing products to stabilize revenue  Taking a data-driven approach to testing new features and products Collaborating in an unbiased way with other MakerDAO contributors  @TRUEMAKER represented Onestone in yesterday\u2019s Meet Your Delegate #19 call.  Executive Inclusion: GRO-001 MKR Vesting Stream Clean-Up  In order to avoid the Growth Core Unit being able to claim an extra 63.18 MKR over and above the 803 MKR approved as the team\u2019s maximum MKR budget, the CU was advised to redirect their MKR stream to the Maker Pause Proxy, making the extra MKR unclaimable. To make this change visible in decentralized front ends that track MKR movement, such as Makerburn, the next Executive Vote will include logic to vest the remaining MKR from the stream to make the actual MKR situation detectable by such tools.  Endgame RFC DVC Calls  Recognized Delegate @twblack88 spearheaded the creation of an open call to help guide Decentralized Voter Committee (DVC) calls toward producing actionable feedback. The first call reached a peak attendance of sixteen participants. While the call was not recorded so that participants could speak more freely, actionable feedback was gathered and posted in the appropriate threads (Endgame v3, the clustering MIP, POVE, and the offboarding MIPs (Events) and (SH)). The next call will be held at 3 pm UTC on Friday, September 16th. Keep an eye on the forum thread for details.  Overview of RWA-related SPFs and Funding Requests  @adcv of the Strategic Finance Core Unit posted a table of the CU\u2019s Special Purpose Funds (SPFs) for Real-World Asset (RWA) initiatives. The table gathers basic data\u2014disbursements, relevant forum threads, governance status, author, purpose, and work status\u2014in one easily referenced forum post.  852\u00d7852 123 KB    Active Discussions  Discussion Bifuricate Maker - realistic path forward or impossible path?!   The idea that Maker and DAI somehow are going to fly its pirate flag under the radar of nation states is hopeful at best and [and] existential risk for everyone associated at worst.  In this post, @MakerMan shares his thoughts on splitting MakerDAO into two separate but related entities:  MakerC and DAIC, where \u201cC\u201d stands for \u201cseeking to be regulatory compliant worldwide\u201d: This entity would be \u201chomed in a friendly jurisdiction,\u201d where it would follow all relevant laws and regulations. MakerP and DAIP, where \u201cP\u201d stands \u201cpirate\u201d: This entity would stick to the original Maker vision of full permissionlessness and decentralization.  @MakerMan sees this bifurcation as the only way to protect MakerDAO contributors from potential offensives from nation states that view decentralized protocols as violating their regulatory frameworks.  LFWs Endgame Commentary  @LongForWisdom added another entry to his ongoing work summarizing and commenting on @rune\u2019s Endgame Plan. This document aims to:  Surface potential risks associated with the Endgame Plan that may have been overlooked Suggest changes designed to avoid Maker getting locked into processes that don\u2019t work Propose simplifications  Specifically, LFW ties these concerns into discussions around MetaDAOs, organizational complexity, expenses, profitability, having a retreat plan, the importance of buy-in among the decentralized workforce, and others. The post concludes with a call to develop an atomic approach to Endgame implementation, suggesting that a vote to commit to an Endgame plan at this early stage may be premature.  Endgame Metanomics diagrams  @rune shared his work so far on a series of diagrams explaining Endgame \u201cMetanomics\u201d and the broader economic and governance equilibrium of the Endgame state. For now, the diagrams assume a base level of knowledge about the Endgame Plan (Stances and MetaDAO classes specifically), but future iterations will include a full introduction to all prerequisite concepts and ideas.  751\u00d7936 161 KB    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Create a Multisig to manage the $VELO veNFT  A poll to Manage Velodrome Airdrops and veNFT passed on June 16, 2022.

To help manage developer bandwidth and reduce costs, no Executive Vote was held this week. 2. An informal poll aims to gauge support for Rune\u2019s Endgame Plan. 3. Endgame DVC calls will no longer be held on Thursday, but continue every Wednesday at the usual time.   News and Announcements  Governance  No Planned Executive  There are no Executive Votes planned for this week. The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has requested to limit Executives to every other week to lighten developers\u2019 workloads and cut down on expenses, though @prose11 points out that this request may not always be feasible.  MIP81 - Call Scheduled with Coinbase CFO  In an effort to raise questions regarding MIP81, GovAlpha scheduled a one-on-one call with Coinbase\u2019s CFO, Alesia Haas. In addition, a thread has been posted in which the community may submit questions that will be discussed during the call. Unfortunately, the call will only last for 30 minutes. The purpose of the call is to ensure that it is as effective as possible; thus only Payton and Alesia will be speaking; Payton will moderate and relay all questions received to Alesia within a reasonable timeframe.

Note: DVC calls will no longer happen on Thursday. Instead, they will continue on only Wednesdays at their usual time of 19:00 UTC.  Postmortems  Curve LP Token Oracle Manipulation Vulnerability - Emergency Response Postmortem  On April 14th, the Curve team notified the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PECU) about a reentrancy manipulation vulnerability in the oracle used for the steCRV (ETH-stETH) pool. In response, Maker stakeholders coordinated to freeze the affected oracle until a solution could be implemented. The solution was included in the April 22nd Executive Vote, and full functionality of the pool was re-enabled when the Executive was executed on April 27th. This postmortem explores how the incident was handled by PECU, exploring both what went well:  The response from Recognized Delegates External engineering relationships A delay on the debt ceiling increases A generally cautious approach to finding the right solution  Furthermore, what needs improvement:  Response time Recognized Delegate contract Communication with the DAO and other stakeholders Unclear leadership Voting portal UI limitations that delayed the resolution process by ten minutes Potentially inaccurate importance score Unclear relationship with Immunefi Security and the role they should play when security risks are identified   Curve LP Token Oracle Manipulation Vulnerability Technical Postmortem  This postmortem of the steCRV pool vulnerability focuses on the technical aspects of how the incident was processed and resolved. In short, the get_virtual_price function of the steCRV oracle returned an incorrect value if it was called at the same time as a withdrawal from the pool, which enabled the possibility of a reentrancy attack. The solution the Protocol Engineering Core Unit settled on was to deploy a fixed oracle contract with functionality for reverting a transaction in the case of a reentrancy attack launched from the Curve pool.   Active Discussions  Informal poll on support for Rune\u2019s Endgame proposal  This poll gauges sentiment about @rune\u2019s Endgame Plan, asking simply: Do you support the Endgame plan? So far, the poll has drawn significant participation from the community.  LV8iYTB1697\u00d7775 141 KB  We can see that opinions are split evenly across the board.  Has there been a shift in regulatory risk? [Informal Poll]  Among the many MIP sets presented to push forward the Endgame plan, @psychonaut alerts his focus on MIP84 in particular, which introduces a significant change in the DAO\u2019s financial management system. Regulatory risks for DAOs and stablecoins continue to be a serious concern, or does it? Well, that\u2019s the question psychonaut brings to light now that everyone has had time to process recent regulatory events such as the OFAC Tornado Cash sanctions. He offers that we attempt to reexamine whether these events have changed the level of regulatory risk for MakerDAO.  1775\u00d71072 157 KB   Discussion on inactive MakerDAO blog  In this thread, @Emily_Davis points out that the MakerDAO blog has been inactive for more than a year and asks the community for clarity on who runs the blog and how it might be brought back to life. As @Davidutro explains, this topic was brought up by the GovComms Core Unit in July of this year. Discussion about reviving the blog was put on the back burner after the Maker Foundation was dissolved and efforts to onboard a marketing Core Unit failed. Progress is unlikely unless MakerDAO stakeholders coordinate to onboard a marketing team or assign the task to an existing Core Unit and allocate its funds.

Risk submits an analysis and presents several reasons to propose lowering stETH-B Stability Fees to 0%. 3. Say hello  and stop by to check out our newest Recognized Delegate, RiskDAO!   News and Announcements  Governance & Delegation   RiskDAO Delegate Platform  Please give a warm welcome to our newest Recognized Delegate, RiskDAO. Their platform consists of three members of RiskDAO, who support rigorous risk frameworks such as implementing a bad debt dashboard that sheds light on risk management practices of major lending protocols. Additionally, they hope to gain hands-on technical knowledge and assistance with the MakerDAO dss system. Check out their delegate platform for more information on RiskDAO\u2019s core values, delegate and vision statements, and previous contributions to the MakerDAO and DeFi ecosystem.  2022-09-28 Executive - Inclusion Update  In this post, GovAlpha Core Unit Facilitator @prose11 explains a series of changes made to yesterday\u2019s Executive Proposal that was announced during last week\u2019s Governance & Risk call. The biggest update was the removal of actions pertaining to onboarding Monetalis. GovAlpha\u2019s concerns stemmed from the CFTC civil enforcement action against Ooki DAO. This event made the team wary of having a US citizen (prose11) on the committee, and changing the committee\u2019s makeup at the last minute would not have allowed enough time for governance to consider the change before voting. The solution agreed on was to have the Monetalis team observe the Executive spell execution, making the formation of a committee unnecessary. The second update applies to the Starknet bridge. While a 1 million DAI debt ceiling and 1 Basis Point fee were initially planned to be implemented in the next Executive, the Starknet team has asked Maker to hold off on these adjustments until fast withdrawals are in place. The only change triggered by yesterday\u2019s Executive was increasing the Bridge Deposit Limit from 50 to 1,000 DAI.  28th September Executive: Updating the proxy_actions_end_cropper address  Yesterday\u2019s Executive Proposal updated the chainlog address for the PROXY_ACTIONS_END_CROPPER. This change addresses an omission in the emergency shutdown process in the steps required for users to redeem DAI for collateral that uses the Cropper contract.  Endgame  Endgame Call Wednesdays  Rune announced that this is the last forum post containing the call link for DVC. Going forward, anyone can watch the #meetings channel in the Maker Discord or follow the MakerDAO community calendar: MakerDAO Calls. Additionally, anyone can join the Endgame Discord for more notifications.  Dai Foundation  Makerdao Github Cleanup - Review Core Unit assignments  Dai Foundation Core Unit Facilitator @sorenpeter made a post calling for several Core Units\u2014Starknet Engineering, Sidestream Auction Services, Protocol Engineering, Oracles, GovAlpha, and DUX\u2014to review proposed changes and archiving of MakerDAO GitHub repositories as part of the ongoing GitHub cleanup initiative.  Intangible Assets as Public goods - Questions  Dai Foundation posted a set of intangible asset documents dedicated to being used as a placeholder for information from the Growth, DUX, and RWF-0x teams on whether the asset(s) requested produced by funding from MakerDAO will be made public goods for the DAO.  The Growth CU has responded to the questions here [1, 2] as part of Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management requests to take over Content Management of www.makerdao.com and the MakerDAO Linkedin Page. To avoid DAO operations being endangered due to asset rights disappearing when a CU/facilitator is offboarded, Dai Foundation has drafted a set of questions to ensure that there is a focus on avoiding that single operators can control important MakerDAO assets and communication channels.

Avalanche stablecoins analytics - The importance of native tokens  In this post, @Marian shares some metrics regarding the rapid growth of stablecoins on the Avalanche smart contract platform.  \u201c.e\u201d tokens represent tokens coming from the official Avalanche-Ethereum bridge; tokens lacking the \u201c.e\u201d are native tokens minted directly on the Avalanche network.  847\u00d7187 36.6 KB   My Thoughts & Multi-chain Market Musings  In this edition of Multi-chain Market Musings, @alec shares his thoughts on the importance of finding a balance between extremes, and dives into the revamped roadmaps of up-and-coming competitor protocols.  Impact Analysis: Lowering stETH-B Stability Fee to 0%  Risk Core Unit submits an impact analysis on our tETH-B vault type, launched in May 2022. In response to the analysis, three arguments are presented to propose lowering stETH-B stability fees to 0%.  Decrease Maker\u2019s reliance on centralized PSM exposure. Increase Maker\u2019s market share of stETH collateral. Encourage long-term adoption.  The analysis also answers questions such as:  How has the stETH total debt per vault type changed since the launch of stETH-B? What about the number of vaults? How did debt collateralized by stETH grow compared to overall market trends? How much vault exposure migrated from stETH-A to stETH-B since stETH-B\u2019s stability fee was dropped to 0%? New users have minted how much stETH-B exposure since the drop in its stability fee?    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Modify D3M Guidance for MOMC  A signal request was polled a year ago to set D3M parameters and MOMC guidance. Given the recent merge and declining stETH risk factors, the Risk CU revisits the MOMC framework to inspect any needed modifications. Context:  The bar parameter guidance framework is currently highly restrictive against deploying funds into the Aave D3M. Aave\u2019s DAI borrow rate is currently at ~2.75%, so a bar of 2.8% with existing guidance would not result in any DAI deployed. The effective DAI borrow rate calculated with the current formula at Aave is ~0.95%, well below Maker\u2019s ETH-A rate. Aave aWETH collateral can be borrowed while Maker ETH vault collateral cannot, which exposes Aave users to tail risk of losing collateral.  One suggestion for the Maker community is to consider modifying the rate comparison calculations, which set the bar parameter to exclude yield and liquidity incentives earned on user collateral. Two poll questions are given as suggested modifications to the rate comparison calculations:  1667\u00d7612 124 KB   1712\u00d71520 267 KB  This signal request will run for two weeks, ending on October 6, 2022. MOMC may include an option in the upcoming parameter changes proposal for October that includes changes to the Aave D3M bar outside previously approved guidance. If such an option is considered, the committee will submit at least one other parameter change proposal option that continues to conform to prior D3M guidance.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa, @alec, and Artem Gordon   Online PDF verson - coming soon     Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. Ethereum development studio ConsenSys published their Delegate Platform, aiming to uphold values like decentralization and transparency as contributors to Maker governance. 2. Well-known crypto exchange Gemini, which issues the stablecoin GUSD, submitted a proposal for a marketing partnership with MakerDAO that could boost revenues. 3. @hexonaut announced the formation of the Crimson Creator Cluster, a proposed Creator MetaDAO that aims to build new products on Maker that take advantage of the low-cost capital available via the D3M.  Forum Recap        News and Announcements  ConsenSys Delegate Platform  Major Ethereum development studio ConsenSys has published its Delegate Platform. The team plans to take a values-based approach to participate in the Maker community, as well as leveraging the expertise of their in-house cryptoeconomics department. The values ConsenSys intends to uphold include the following:  Decentralization Sovereign individualism Transparency Accountability Authenticity Open-source contribution   GUSD & MakerDAO Partnership Announcement  This post from @tylerwinklevoss outlines a proposal for establishing a marketing partnership between MakerDAO and Gemini, the issuer of the Gemini dollar (GUSD). Gemini created this proposal with the Strategic Finance and Growth Core Units. The Gemini is offering to contribute to MakerDAO at a fixed rate of 1.25%, annualized and paid out every month, for any GUSD present in the PSM, with the condition that the average monthly balance on the last day of the month must exceed $100M GUSD. A Signal Request has been submitted regarding modifying specific parameters of PSM-GUSD-A to enable Maker\u2019s participation in the incentive program if the proposal is approved.  [Poll Notice] Signal Support for Ending DAI Funding for Sourcecred  This post announces an on-chain poll next week to gather sentiment regarding removing DAI funding for Sourcecred. GovAlpha currently spends 3,500 DAI per week on the Sourcecred program, representing about 25% of the Core Unit\u2019s DAI expenses. The team believes the program may no longer provide value for the DAO, and both sides of the argument are presented in this post. Some of the reasons presented for discontinuing the Sourcecred program include the following:  GovAlpha\u2019s research into identifying positive results from the program has been inconclusive Participation rewards may worsen the high noise-to-signal ratio on the forum Administration of the program costs GovAlpha 10-20 hours of work each month  Some of the reasons for keeping the program include the following:  May foster enthusiasm for participating in Maker governance Sourcecred could play a role in MetaDAOS if the Endgame proposals are approved  GovAlpha Core Unit Facilitator and author of the post @Patrick_J notes that he believes that the Sourcecred program is not providing value.  An Unreal Primer on Real World Assets  This post from @teej announces the publication of an 87-page report diving deep into the world of Real World Assets. Topics covered include the history of RWA tokenization, why RWA tokenization is essential and the opportunities it unlocks, predictions about where the industry is going, and a breakdown and classification of the existing RWA landscape.  1100\u00d71204 178 KB  The report was sponsored by Polygon, Ondo, and Bril Finance.   Active Discussions  Crimson Creator Cluster  @hexonaut of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit Team made a post announcing the Crimson Creator Cluster, a group aiming to become the core team of a Creator MetaDAO. The group hopes to build new products on top of Maker, which can offer highly competitive rates due to low-cost capital from D3M injection.  Q3 2022 MKR Decentralization, Delegation, and Distribution Update  @lyt of the Strategic Finance CU provides a detailed breakdown of selected metrics on the decentralization, delegation, and distribution of the MKR token and governance.  StakeWise V3 <> Maker  This post by @Jstar informs the community about the upcoming V3 upgrade of StakeWise, which will transition the protocol to full permissionlessness. Jstar points out several different avenues by which Maker could benefit from the upgrade, such as:  Adding StakeWise\u2019s overcollateralized staked ETH token, osETH, as a collateral type The two-layer architecture enables the minting of any token that requires managed overcollateralized debt positions, including DAI; this means users can access DAI through StakeWise with better capital efficiency Maker could become a node operator for the StakeWise protocol and stake its ETH to help manage the DAI supply or yield farm   How Is Dai Holding Its Peg?  In this post, @puniaviision asks for clarification on how DAI maintains its peg, noting that there appears to be consistent sell pressure due to some of DAI\u2019s most natural use cases:  840\u00d7114 23 KB  Another way to phrase the question is, \u201cWith the constant sell pressure, how has the PSM not run out of DAI, leading to DAI falling below the peg?\u201d @Twigmaester shared another thread asking a similar question, and several forum members stepped in to share their views.  The Devcon VI Endgame Kickoff w/Matthew Rabinowitz of 6S Capital, on Drinks with MakerDAO Delegates  In this post, our usual hosts @flipflopflapdelegate and @ultraschuppi, with the recent hosting addition of @rspa, were joined by Matthew Rabinowitz (@mrabino1) of 6S Capital to talk about the 6S perspective on the Endgame Plan, the state of Real World Assets within the DAO, and other topics.       Circuit breaker trade-offs and questions for the community  In this post, StarkNet Engineering Core Unit Facilitator @pyramidmaker follows up on this post sharing what the team learned from studying past token bridge hacks with an overview of an essential part of the team\u2019s risk mitigation plan: circuit breakers. Implementing a circuit breaker as part of the StarkNet bridge would enable shutting down the bridge if certain thresholds, such as daily minting and withdrawal limits, are breached. The post goes on to weigh some of the advantages and disadvantages of different methods of implementing a circuit breaker and asks the community for feedback.   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  Change PSM-GUSD-A parameters  This Signal Request seeks to gauge interest in changing specific parameters for PSM-GUSD-A to enable participation in Gemini\u2019s marketing incentive proposal. These parameters are:  Adjusting tout from 0bps to 20bps Adjusting line from 60M to 500M Adjusting gap from 10M to 50M  So far, it looks like the majority of the community is in favor of increasing said parameters:  1707\u00d7685 108 KB  This signal request ran for one week and ends tomorrow, October 7th.  Modify D3M Guidance for MOMC  A signal request was polled a year ago to set D3M parameters and MOMC guidance. Given the recent merge and declining stETH risk factors, the Risk CU revisits the MOMC framework to inspect any needed modifications. Context:  The bar parameter guidance framework is currently highly restrictive against deploying funds into the Aave D3M. Aave\u2019s DAI borrow rate is currently at ~2.75%, so a bar of 2.8% with existing guidance would not result in any DAI deployed. The effective DAI borrow rate calculated with the current formula at Aave is ~0.95%, well below Maker\u2019s ETH-A rate. Aave aWETH collateral can be borrowed while Maker ETH vault collateral cannot, which exposes Aave users to tail risk of losing collateral.  One suggestion for the Maker community is to consider modifying the rate comparison calculations, which set the bar parameter to exclude yield and liquidity incentives earned on user collateral. Two suggested poll questions are given as suggested modifications to the rate comparison calculations:  1752\u00d7680 137 KB   1577\u00d71392 251 KB  This signal request ran for two weeks and ends today, October 6th. MOMC may include an option in the upcoming parameter changes proposal for October that includes changes to the Aave D3M bar outside previously approved guidance. If such an option is considered, the committee will submit at least one other parameter change proposal option that continues to conform to prior D3M guidance.

Per the rules laid out by the Endgame Plan, this MetaDAO would be fully decentralized from its creation, and governance will be completely in the hands of holders of the MetaDAO\u2019s tokens, which will be widely distributed via a farming program. The team will initially focus on achieving two primary goals: Use tailored investment strategies that contribute toward \u201carresting climate change,\u201d and contribute to the integration of DeFi/CeFi/TradFi.  Updating the short-term bond strategy?  In this post, @SebVentures of the Strategic Finance Core Unit shared some thoughts on adjusting MakerDAO\u2019s short-term bond strategy to increase revenues and become profitable.

The main goal is to reduce the friction and costs of hiring new people. Anyone can apply to join or refer a colleague and earn bounty rewards for doing so.  1035\u00d7775 59.9 KB  @synesthesia is asking the community for feedback on the design and user experience of the platform, so leave a comment on the post or find him on Discord @synesthesia to share your thoughts.  Maker Academy Initial Release  This press release announces the initial launch of Maker Academy, a slick educational platform aimed at helping newbies come to grips with the complexities of MakerDAO and with DeFi more widely. While many community members view the undertaking as valuable, some have concerns about its cost-effectiveness and potential impact. Join the conversation to share your feedback, comments, or concerns.   Active Discussions  a16z | Thoughts on Endgame  In this post, @Porter_Smith shares A16z\u2019s thoughts on the overall strategic direction for MakerDAO and how the Endgame Plan fits into that direction. The post goes into a good amount of detail regarding what the team believes is vital to focus on going forward\u2014namely, finding a satisfactory answer to the question: \u201cHow can we increase MakerDAO\u2019s decentralization while optimizing long-term growth?\u201d While the team believes that the Endgame Plan contains good ideas, it will individually vote on MIPs based on the criteria outlined in the post. Deeper summary and Endgame discussion analysis can be found in our latest Weekly Relay issue here.  MKR Only Discord?  This poll submitted by Recognized Delegate @rspa asks the community whether a Discord channel should be created exclusively for large MKR holders. This may provide a way for MKR holders to provide input other than directly participating in governance or public forums. The poll also asks what the minimum amount of MKR should be for a user to gain access to the channel and whether a tool like Voltaire should be used to enable anonymous discussion.  MetaDAO Clusters & Endgame Vision   There were two new MetaDAO proposals submitted this week, which are the TaiDai and Spring clusters. You can find shorter summaries about each proposal in our latest Weekly Relay issue here. Additionaly, Rune posted his ideas on further expanding Endgame goals, motivations, and integrations into clean money and nuclear energy initiatives.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Online PDF version Authors: @nothsa, @alec, and Artem Gordon   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. The Risk Core Unit\u2019s latest report explores intra-protocol exposure migration between Vaults. 2. Rune proposes an implementation of user revenue share and fixed-rate modules as mechanisms for increasing decentralized collateral backing and borrowing. 3. Prose11 shared his thoughts on implementing Hats Protocol to manage permissions in the DAO.         News and Announcements  LBS Blockchain - Envoy Proposal Alert Tool  Recognized Delegate @park shared a tool called Envoy, developed by their team to help Delegates keep track of new and expiring proposals and Executive Votes. Delegates and anyone interested in using the tool can join the Telegram channel to receive alerts.    Active Discussions  Proposal Idea - Utilizing Hats Protocol ERC-1155s  In this post, GovAlpha Core Unit Facilitator @prose11 presents the idea of using Hats Protocol to handle permissions for different DAO contributors and their roles and responsibilities. As a trial run, he suggests writing a simple MIP to apply Hats to the current Core Unit structure and instituting at least three levels of permissions. He hopes to have a MIP ready for the January Governance cycle if the community supports the idea.  Fixed rates strategies and mechanisms in the Decentralized Collateral Scope  Decentralized collateral backing is achieved through borrower participation, but borrowers are more likely to opt for fixed-rate loans, which makes them an essential resource for Deco and Creator clusters. Considering this, @rune proposes two incentive mechanisms that will increase the number of borrowers and benefit MetaDAOs that do not offer fixed-rate products. As a first mechanism, revenue share bonuses are offered to users as an incentive:  Only applicable to Maker Core Vaults that do not support MetaDAO token yield farming. A retroactive revenue share is provided for the stability fees earned from such vaults.  A vault\u2019s duration is used as a measure of creditworthiness.   MetaDAO and ecosystem actor frontends are eligible for a revenue share opportunity in addition to the standard 25% stability fee revenue share. Parameters contain a 10% bonus accrued over one year.  Example 1: A vault that pays 1,000 DAI in SF over a year generates a 10% bonus + 25% (SF) for the 12 months, resulting in a total of 35% revenue share - 350 DAI. Example 2: A vault that pays 500 DAI in SF over six months generates a 5% bonus plus the standard 25% (SF) for the 6 months, resulting in a total of 30% revenue share - 150 DAI.    As a second mechanism, we will have a fixed-rate module:  Regulated through the Decentralized Collateral Scope Framework.  Managed by Maker Governance Votes in accordance with advice provided by Decentralized Collateral Core Units. Utilizes protocols such as Deco and similar products to target a fixed rates strategy for decentralized assets and their vaults. The Decentralized Collateral Core Units will develop a targeted portfolio based on data and frameworks provided by the Stability and Liquidity Scope.  Rune discussed this topic in depth during this week\u2019s Decentralized Voter Committee call found here.    Research and Reports  Vault User Research: Intra-Protocol Exposure Migration  This report from the Risk Core Unit provides a high-level analysis of Vault exposure migration, providing a more general viewpoint than their previous report on migration from stETH-A to stETH-B Vaults. The key takeaways are:  Direct migration amounts are relatively low All (direct and indirect) migrations are rare and dominated by a few whales Low-fee Vault types are becoming increasingly dominant   SourceCred Bi-Weekly Happenings  The latest edition of SourceCred Bi-Weekly Happenings is out! The results of last week\u2019s on-chain vote will stop the funding of contributions with DAI, effective November 1st. GovAlpha will continue the search for alternatives, and the Proposal Bounties Program is still up and running. Over the last three weeks, a total of 4,454 Cred was generated, with 82 new topics created and 706 new posts made.  788\u00d7497 23.9 KB     Signal Requests   A note on Signal Requests  As a result of the Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set passing and the relevant MIP16 amendment, Signal Requests will no longer be posted to the forum unless a relevant MIP supports them. This will fully effect once the two active signals (below) are finished.  Clear Vaults\u2019 Bad Debt in the MakerDAO protocol  This Signal Request gathers sentiment on whether to clear 1.3M DAI of bad Vault debt that has not been liquidated and the best approach in doing so.

ETH-Gathering is rumored to have many people attending, and Andrew wants nothing more than to finish with one final hoorah! Beanies, bags, socks, shirts, and more. His signal request is asking the community for one final transfer of 49,999 DAI to the SHCU Operational Wallet along with a Golden Parachute of 5.21 MKR (the sum represents the pro-rated vest over an additional month and is based on previously approved terms outlined in the SHCU\u2019s onboarding MIPS.)

Active Discussions  Lessons for Maker from the Collapse of HUSD  In the wake of HUSD losing its peg after Huobi announced it would be delisting the stablecoin, Recognized Delegate @Doo_StableLab shared some takeaways for the MakerDAO community.  Not all centralized stablecoins are the same  Some assert that all centralized stablecoins operate similarly, especially those using Paxos for custody. In the case of HUSD, there was a lack of transparency and communication: While Paxos initially supported the stablecoin, it was later revealed that the US dollars backing the coin were actually stored in Huobi Trust.  Risky stablecoin management has consequences  Stories abound of HUSD aggressively seeking increased market share by selling the coin at favorable rates. After many Asian partners went bankrupt or shut down under similar circumstances to the Celsius situation in the West, some of this investment may have \u201cturned sour\u201d as redemption requests ramped up, resulting in an undercollateralized HUSD. In conclusion, Doo believes that it\u2019s good to utilize our own stablecoin collateral; however, we should be cautious in how we manage these stablecoins, or else we may also face liquidity trouble.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa and Artem Gordon PDF version   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. The Risk Core Unit team has proposed a series of intermediate parameter changes to reduce the risk associated with decreased collateralization of the MANA-A vault type as the token\u2019s price has fallen. 2. The Strategic Finance Core Unit released a tool for exploring the consequences of onboarding different collateral types to the Maker ecosystem. 3. A report from the Risk Core Unit analyzes vault churn dynamics, resulting in some interesting takeaways.          Announcements & Updates  Build Your Own ALM Model  To help MKR holders and governance participators understand the potential effects of onboarding different types of collateral, the Strategic Finance Core Unit has released simple asset-liability management (ALM) spreadsheet for community members to experiment with. The post explains how to use the sheet and what each data set represents. So if you\u2019re curious how financials would be affected by a particular colla  1035\u00d7573 64.8 KB  The yellow cells are intended to be edited to explore the consequences of using different values for these parameters. The top part of the spreadsheet features three different sections displaying several metrics derived from the parameters mentioned above:  Item 1: A simplified income statement. Item 2: Surplus Buffer coverage, a major limitation on the risk MakerDAO can take. Item 3: A list of conditions that should be met; an adequate solution should have no red cells.  The bottom half of the spreadsheet lists all proposed collateral types and metrics, such as exposure, expected return, and capital at risk. Key takeaways from this project include:  The Surplus Buffer is a limitation without an obvious solution. MakerDAO does not have enough capital for all the current proposals.     Active Discussions & Proposals  MANA-A intermediate parameter change proposal  Risk associated with the MANA-A vault type has increased dramatically due to a decrease in collateralization as the price of MANA fell in recent months. One particular whale appears to control most or all of the existing vaults and has not been very active. The liquidation of one of these vaults could result in cascading liquidations if the vaults are not protected. The Risk Core Unit recommends decreasing Maker\u2019s exposure to MANA by adjusting parameters to incentivize debt repayment and further incentivizing vault owners to prevent liquidation events. Specifically, the team proposes:  Decreasing DC to 3M DAI from the current 10M Significantly increasing SF to 50% from the current 7.5% Increasing the liquidation penalty to 30% from the current 13%   Kao Protocol - Seed Investment / Venture Debt  This post asks MakerDAO for a $60K investment in Kao Protocol, a DAO and DeFi protocol in which users can stake NFTs to earn yield. The team plans to issue real estate NFTs representing fractionalized ownership shares in African real estate. Recognized Delegate @Doo_StableLab stepped in to share his thoughts on the proposal:  919\u00d7122 22.3 KB   Why\u2019s growth core unit is not focusing on Indian & Vietnam markets?  @ihsotas expresses his concern on DAI growth rate and adoption in India and Vietnam. Recognized Delegate Doo Stablenode states that we often collaborate in these countries and markets, such as Axie Infinity. However, ihsotas further clarifies that he\u2019s strongly worried about the nearly non-existent DAI-INR volume on exchanges.    Research & Reports  Vault User Research: Survival Analysis  This research report from the Risk Core Unit dives into churn dynamics, investigating how well Maker vault users are retained over time. The analysis is broken down into six primary areas:  Vault Count Distribution split by Activity State   903\u00d7310 19 KB  Only about 9% of the ~28,000 vaults opened historically remain open. The median tenure for churned vaults\u2014defined as the difference in months between when the vault was opened and when it decreased its position below 10,000 DAI\u2014is about four months. The median tenure for retained vaults is about a year.  Vault Survival Curve split by Entity Level (Wallet vs. Vault Level)   903\u00d7481 16.9 KB  The y-axis shows the percentage of still active vaults, and the x-axis shows the number of months since the vault was opened (its tenure). Takeaways:  Less than 5% of vaults/wallets tend to remain active after 36 months. 30% of wallets remain active after a year of usage, similar to vaults. The representative/median tenure before churning is five months.   Vault Survival Curve split by Collateral Symbol   903\u00d7480 19.6 KB  stETH has the best early retention, followed by WBTC and ETH.  Vault Survival Curve split by Liquidation Churn State   713\u00d7455 32.1 KB  It stands to reason that experiencing a liquidation could significantly lead to vault churn. However, the data shows a negligible connection between vaults that experience liquidation and early churning rates.  Vault Survival Curve split by Vault Type (ETH Collateral)   903\u00d7478 20.6 KB  This chart looks explicitly at ETH. ETH-C (low fee, high liquidation ratio) and ETH-A (medium fee, medium liquidation ratio) appear to be retained better, while ETH-B (high fee, low liquidation ratio) is the worst-retaining vault type. This tracks with the idea that more risk-tolerant vault users are more likely to churn due to being more likely to optimize for capital efficiency across the ecosystem.  Vault Survival Curve split by Debt Size   903\u00d7481 29.7 KB  A clear relationship exists between improved retention and maximum vault size. 70% of vaults with 100M+ DAI exposure remain active after one year of usage, compared to 25% of vaults with 10,000 DAI to 100,000 DAI after the same time.

The Risk Core Unit is recommending a reduction in the minimum permitted Vault debt, or dust, intending to increase user acquisition and accessibility. 3. A post from the MakerDAO Open Market Committee explores increasing the DAI Savings Rate to distribute extra revenue to DAI holders and incentivize stablecoin loan suppliers to migrate to DAI.          Announcements & Updates  StarkNet changes for 2022-10-26 Executive Spell [1, 2]  The executive spell, which took place on October 26, updated the StarkNet bridge in light of changes to StarkNet\u2019s fee structure. To avoid the possibility of infinite transactions, fees are now charged by the Starknet sequencer for any L2 transactions and L1 \u2192 L2 messages. To accommodate this feature, the L1DaiBridge.deposit and L1DaiBridge.forceWithdrawal functions of Maker\u2019s StarkNet bridge were modified.  Candidates for Dai Foundation Board Member Election Poll  This post announces two candidates, @Daimon-Law and @0xbocaJ, seeking election to the Dai Foundation Board in accordance with the Foundation\u2019s commitment to including members appointed by MakerDAO. Paul Imseih\u2014known as Daimon-Law on the forum\u2014is an Australian and UK lawyer with over 25 years of experience working mainly in the technology and intellectual property sectors. His candidate statement is available here. Jacob Minne\u20140xbocaJ on the forum\u2014has worked in blockchain since 2012. His legal career has focused on IP counseling and litigation. Jacob\u2019s candidate statement is available here.  Agreement between MakerGrowth and GnosisDAO  This document posted by the Growth Core Unit is an initial proposal for review regarding adding Gnosis\u2019 GNO token as a collateral type. Scope   Introduction of GNO-A vault in MCD GnosisDAO continuation of borrowing activity with highly liquid decentralized assets (e.g., stEth) in MCD Further development in a second phase through joint collaboration efforts of the DAI ecosystem, liquidity, and userbase in GnosisDAO-controlled projects, including but not limited to Gnosis Chain (GC)   Vault Parameters   DC-IAM Line (max DC): 5M Liquidation ratio: 350% Stability fee: 2.5%   In accordance with the agreement, Gnosis must remain an active MCD Vault user, maintain no less than 75% of GnosisDAO stablecoin borrowing activities with highly liquid assets, and utilize the GNO-A debt ceiling as soon as possible.    Active Discussions & Proposals  Endgame Plan next steps: 2023 milestones for MetaDAO Launch  This post from @rune outlines some Pregame phase Endgame Plan milestones we hope to see in 2023. These building blocks must be in place to launch the on-chain components of MetaDAOs. The list of Pregame products includes:   EtherDai token wrapper deployment Elixir Balancer pool deployment MetaDAO ERC20 token deployments (one for each MetaDAO) Meta Elixir Uniswap v2 pool deployments (one for each MetaDAO) Anti-Reflexivity Mechanic deployments (one for each MetaDAO)  Linear token sales mechanism to prevent price spikes   Dai Farms (one for each MetaDAO) EtherDai Farms (one for each MetaDAO) MKR Farms (one for each MetaDAO) Metanomics I deployment  70,000 MKR emitted per year, with 60,000 funneled directly to the Meta Elixir of each of the MetaDAOs   Various dss-kiln and proxy contract deployments to manage accounts and token flows for MetaDAOs   We\u2019ll also need a minimum viable product of MetaDAO frontends, which will require these features:   Access to all Dai Farms Access to opening Maker Vaults (including EtherDai Vaults) Access to all EtherDai Vault Farms Access to all MKR Farms MVP of the Easy Voter Frontend that is required for users who wish to farm with MKR, as they need to first delegate through this frontend to be able to farm with MKR Support for MetaDAOs adding their products or external services   Further products needed to move beyond the Pregame phase include setting in place the MetaDAO cluster journey\u2014from Cluster announcements (several of which have already been made) to normal operation\u2014as well as an Endgame Constitution and Scope Frameworks.  Adjusting Dust Parameter (November 2022)  With Ethereum gas prices having dropped significantly, this post from the Risk Core Unit\u2019s @monet-supply makes a case for lowering the minimum permitted debt\u2014or dust\u2014for Vaults. This could enable more accessibility and increase user acquisition. As evidenced by Compound and Aave, neither of which has a minimum dust limit, any potential losses from bad debt are likely to be offset by user acquisition gains. The proposed changes come in two options: Option 1: This option includes a broad reduction of dust limits across Vault types.   Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 5,000 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 2,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 15,000 DAI Reduce dust for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, MATIC-A, MANA-A, and RENBTC-A to 10,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A   Option 2: This option includes more limited dust reductions, targeting large-cap Vault types with the highest potential utility for small users while limiting the risk of liquidation losses.   Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 7,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 3,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 25,000 DAI Leave dust unchanged for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, MATIC-A, MANA-A, RENBTC-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, UNIV2DAIUSDC-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, and GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A    Enabling the DSR  This post from the MakerDAO Open Market Committee (MOMC) points out that yield spreads between DeFi and TradFi are growing and that this trend is not likely to abate any time soon. The post explores increasing the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to distribute some of the extra revenue that Maker is likely to see in the near future to existing DAI holders who are currently not earning any yield. Increasing the DSR would significantly boost yields in protocols like Aave and Compound, which have integrations with the DSR, incentivizing USDC suppliers to migrate to DAI instead. If this happens successfully, we can expect an accompanying increase in Net Protocol Income.   Calculating the value of RWAs and the surplus buffer  In this post, Recognized Delegate @CodeKnight points out the importance of having a defined way of calculating the specific value of the Surplus Buffer is calculated in light of MIP84: Activate Protocol-Owned Vault Emulation. This calculation will be critical when it comes to working with bonds. @tadeo stepped in to inform us that the Data Insights Core Unit is working on a model to accurately reflect actual revenue, including RWAs.  New Silver Requesting Debt Ceiling Increase  New Silver is requesting a series of changes to its RWA agreement with MakerDAO:   Adding in WSFS as the trustee, based on the Trust Indenture put together earlier this year by Christian Petersen and Eli Cohen Increase Vault debt ceiling to 50mm DAI Remove senior co-investor requirement and over-collateralization requirement Increase Junior minimum to 20% from 15% Increase stability fee to 4.5% from 3.5%      Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - GovAlpha Core Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual.

Forum Recap:          Announcements & Updates  November 23rd Endgame Call: Timeline and roadmap for organizing Maker Governance based on DVCs, the Endgame Constitution and the 12 Scopes  Yesterday\u2019s Endgame Call focused on the practical aspects of governance reform outlined by the Endgame Plan. The main topics included:  Establishing a nearly immutable Endgame Constitution that all mandated actors, professional ecosystem participants, and official infrastructure must be compliant with Bootstrapping the 12 Scope Frameworks that will be the foundational tool for all governance decisions and contain any and all mutable complexity of Maker Governance Bootstrapping the Decentralized Voter Committee (DVC) concept, starting with three launch DVCs that will start to delineate the simple fundamental choices available to MKR holders for determining their preferred governance style Operationalizing the three urgent priorities of the Pregame phase, which are:  Building community momentum for MetaDAO participation Attracting Maker Core RWA talent Attracting a new generation of professional delegates    A rough 2023 roadmap includes the following:   Q1:  Drafting the Constitution and Scope Framework Decisions on the cleanup of legacy infrastructure, product lines, collateral, etc. Clustering participants by Scope:  MKR Holders/DVC members Delegates Full-time specialized Professionals (Council or Tribunal)      Q2:  Passing the first MIP version of the Constitution and some or all of the initial Scope Frameworks DVCs begin to operate formally New versions of each Scope Framework updated based on the discussion and research done during the quarter Governance-style decisions made based on voter support of each of the 3 (or more) DVCs    Q3 and Q4 will iterate on the procedures carried out in Q2. By Q4, the first post-launch quarter, Scope Frameworks will be used to regulate and interact with MetaDAOs in a live environment with voter incentives in place.       The Future for GovComms \u2013 a message encouraging voters to pass our current budget proposal  With the pre-launch phase of the Endgame plan moving forward, Core Units must begin to wind down and adequately transition. @Davidutro announced that becoming an Ecosystem Actor is the best approach for the GovComms Core Unit. In this new ecosystem, GovComms can propose project-based engagements to both MakerDAO and independently, serving as a powerful supporting actor. The Core Unit will continue to support Maker Core during what we all hope will be a reasonably smooth transition. With this now on the table, the GovComms team hopes for the support of their current budget proposal (on-chain right now).    Active Discussions & Proposals  Executive Inclusion: Starknet bridge limit  The StarkNet Engineering Core Unit requests that the increased debt ceiling of 1M DAI (up from 200K DAI) for the StarkNet bridge, which has already been approved, be included in an Executive Vote.  Un-Fuzzing the Endgame Plan at EthGathering Barcelona  @ultraschuppi, @flipflopflapdelegate, and @rspa return with another episode of Drinks with MakerDAO Delegates! In this episode, the trio convenes at EthGathering Barcelona to dive into and \u201cun-fuzz\u201d the basic mechanics of the Pregame Phase of the Endgame Plan. Check it out here for an overview or refresher.  CES Core Unit & Facilitator Offboarding/ Onboarding lollike [1, 2, 3, 4]  Several MIPs have been submitted regarding offboarding @monkey.irish as the CES Core Unit Facilitator and onboarding a new Facilitator and Interim Facilitator(s). monkey.irish has chosen to resign from the position due to what he views as a value misalignment, stating that \u201cthis project lacks the fundamental qualities of why I committed myself to blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and the overall industry.\u201d monkey.irish has nominated @zmtong and @dbkcan as interim Facilitators, and @juan has already submitted a MIP nominating @lollike as the new Facilitator due to his long tenure with MakerDAO and \u201cvast knowledge\u201d of the MakerDAO protocol and ecosystem.  Collateral On-Boarding and Management of RWAs - Lessons Learned/Recommendations  In this post, dbkcan of the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit (CES) shares what the team has learned regarding onboarding and managing Real World Assets (RWAs) and makes some recommendations for working with RWAs going forward. The first topic covered is the MIP21 Toolkit, which was produced before the formation of CES and intended to provide tools for experimenting with the on-chain abstraction of small RWA transactions. While this toolkit has been helpful in the rapid onboarding of new RWAs, more complex recent deals have required significant tweaking and the creation of new components to be executed successfully. In short, CES has identified three primary areas in which MIP21 is deficient:  Scalability of transactions Transparency Lack of collateral management  More specifically, issues include:  Collateral valuation reliance on centralized off-chain counterparties  This means that until a Vault is closed, Maker\u2019s only way of determining the value of an RWA is based on reporting from the borrower Ways to mitigate this issue include:  Proactively requiring new borrowers/proposers to incorporate in their proposals how they plan to automate and create DAO-friendly reporting terms and technical approaches Providing details on how external APIs and oracles can be used to automate collateral management     Liquidation and enforcement of collateralization ratios is a manual process with no single point of responsibility  Without automating Vault liquidation, there is a significant risk that any problems with the underlying RWA collateral will be detected late Ways to mitigate these concerns include:  Creating an RWA token wrapper to facilitate the availability of basic financial instrument data Using oracles, trustees, and centralized APIs to update on-chain data Modifying MIP21 to use relevant on-chain data to provide automated early warnings/liquidation triggers based on debt serviceability     RWA stability fees do not provide objective early warning signals for potential problem vaults and could significantly overstate the surplus buffer  Ways to mitigate this issue include:  Short term: restrict usage of accrued Vault stability fees for RWA Vaults expected to remain open for more than 6-12 months to only the lowest risk RWA asset transactions Medium-term: bring more data on-chain to facilitate the automatic verification of payments and/or facilitate early warning of potential collateral impairment       Poll to move forward with the commercial risk, legal, technical, and other work necessary to onboard the deal outlined in MIP90  This request to submit a poll aims to gather sentiment regarding making the assessments required to onboard the deal outlined in MIP90: Liquid AAA Structured Credit & Money Market Fund . The full terms of the deal are available in the post, but in short, the deal involves opening a DAI 600MM RWA Vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and acquire USD 600MM of diversified, AAA (or equivalent) rated Structured Credit and Money Market Funds.    Research, Reports & Assessments  BlockTower Credit CES Domain Team  This Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit post represents the team\u2019s official evaluation of BlockTower Credit. The key takeaways are:  The technical smart contract risk is considered \u201cMedium\u201d due to the implementation:  Utilizing contracts outside of Maker\u2019s scope Not being extensively reviewed by Maker Involving the increased operational overhead of managing four Vaults instead of a single Vault, resulting directly in Executive Spells and increasing technical risk   Clear processes for assessing the ongoing performance of the collateral will be required for required manual monitoring Limiting the amount of maintenance work required in Executive Spells for future deals will reduce technical risk     Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - GovAlpha Core Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa and Artem Gordon PDF version   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. LongForWisdom shared an idea for a new voting system aimed at providing a more consensus-building approach to governance and easing polarization. 2. Retro has been officially appointed as the Interim Facilitator of the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit. 3. Hexonaut opened the floor for a discussion of existential asset exposure and shared ideas for mitigating large losses. Forum Recap:          Announcements & Updates  Moving 30th Nov and 7th Dec Executives to Friday of each week  PECU and StarkNet are moving the mainnet deployments for the following two executives:  Wednesday November 30th to Friday December 2nd. Wednesday December 7th to Friday December 9th.  Both executive votes for the current and following weeks will take place on Friday rather than Wednesday to ensure that these final executive votes for 2022 can be safely deployed.  Retro as Fallback Interim Facilitator for CES  We are pleased to announce that @Retro has been selected to serve as Interim Facilitator of the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit and will focus on the following immediate actions:  Re-enable and stabilize CES resources and contributors. Obtain a clear understanding of work requirements, timelines, and deliverables. Reconfigure CES\u2019s multi-sigs to meet MakerDAO\u2019s best practices, and review operational expenses. Begin planning for the future state of CES resources. Define the Interim Facilitator timeline.  Fortunafi Update - Pipe Technologies This post from @Fortunafi rebuts recent rumors about the protocol\u2019s exposure to crypto miners. The post reports that Fortunafi has \u201cno exposure to crypto miners whatsoever.\u201d Attention RENBTC-A Users: Collateral Offboarding The RENBTC-A vault type is being offboarded. An Executive Vote on Wednesday, December 7th, or later will trigger the final parameter adjustments to complete the offboarding process. GovComms Core Unit Budget Rejected The GovComms Core Unit\u2014the team behind this publication\u2014had its budget rejected in a November 22nd vote. The team will continue its core work until officially winding down. Some community members have demonstrated support for a potential merger between GovComms and GovAlpha, and Core Unit Facilitator @Davidutro has expressed interest in the CU moving into the role of Ecosystem Actor during the Endgame.    Active Discussions & Proposals MIP4c2-SP30: Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process MIP4c2-SP30 contains a series of amendments addressing two primary issues with the current Interim Facilitator process:  Lack of timely resolution: The Fallback Process that kicks in when the initial process fails takes at least a week, long enough for major issues to arise. Lack of flexibility: Governance Facilitators cannot modify processes under atypical circumstances.  A Better Prioritization System for MakerDAO In this post, @LongForWisdom of the GovAlpha Core Unit presents a voting system\u2014a combination of positional voting and the approval voting system currently in place in Maker governance\u2014that will enable individual voters to express more fine-grained preferences than the current approval voting system alone. This system could be used to identify work priorities and in the Endgame to prioritize work on scopes, within DVCs, and within MetaDAOs. GovAlpha hopes this system will promote consensus building and reduce polarization from contentious votes. Discussion on Existential Exposure and Mitigation In this post, @hexonaut of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit calls for a discussion to clarify what we mean by \u201cexistential exposure\u201d\u2014when does \u201creally bad\u201d single asset exposure become \u201cexistentially bad\u201d\u2014and to develop ways of mitigating it. According to hexonaut\u2019s proposed definition, we have \u201cexistential exposure\u201d when \u201cwe take on bad debt to such a degree that DAI permanently loses its peg in an irrecoverable way.\u201d Hexonaut\u2019s idea for mitigating large losses involves allowing temporary under collateralization and leaving bad debt on the books in the case of a large loss that hits a certain threshold, then filling the gap over time via slow issuance of MKR tokens, debt, or revenue. Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 24 November 2022 The latest parameter change proposal from the MakerDAO Open Market Committee recommends a series of updates to normalize debt ceiling IAM parameters during the bear market, reducing risk and unnecessary excess capacity. The proposed changes are:   ETH-B: Reduce line to 250 million DAI:  Reduces tail risk. Prevents excessive accumulation of risky debt.    WSTETH-A: Increase line to 500 million DAI and reduce gap to 15 million DAI:  Allows for further growth. Reduces maximum exposure to possible Lido tail risks.    WSTETH-B: Increase line to 500 million DAI and reduce gap to 15 million DAI:  Allows for further growth. Reduces maximum exposure to possible Lido tail risks.    WBTC-A: Reduce line to 500 million DAI, reduce gap to 20 million DAI, and increase ttl to 24 hours:  Limits excessive exposure growth. Reduces throughput, helping limit potential losses from Bitgo-related tail risks.    WBTC-B: Reduce line to 250 million DAI, reduce gap to 10 million DAI, and increase ttl to 24 hours:  Limit potential tail risk exposure.    WBTC-C: Reduce line to 500 million DAI, reduce gap to 20 million DAI, and increase ttl to 24 hours:  Reduces total throughput to 50 million DAI per day, which should be enough to meet recent demand levels while significantly reducing Bitgo risk exposure.    LINK-A: Reduce gap to 2.5 million DAI:  Existing 7 million DAI gap parameter no longer provides any additional protection.    MANA-A: Reduce line to 0 DAI:  Reduces liquidity and market risk.    YFI-A: Reduce gap to 1.5 million DAI:  Normalizes the YFI-A gap against the recently lowered line parameter.    Compound v2 D3M: Activate with 2% bar and line of up to 10 million DAI:  Idiosyncratic risks have increased lending protocols in the past month, and a smaller line of 10 million is more appropriate.    GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A: Reduce line to 100 million DAI:  Prevents further growth. Helps achieve a decline in exposure while minimizing the UX impacts of potential increases in the Stability Fee.    GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A: Reduce line to 100 million DAI:  Helps realign Maker\u2019s stablecoin positions with current opportunities.    UNIV2DAIUSDC-A: Reduce line to 100 million DAI:  Prevents excessive growth. Helps realign Maker liquidity toward optimal positioning.    PSM-USDP-A: Increase tin to 0.1% and reduce line to 450 million DAI:  Limits increases in USDP exposure to concentrate Maker\u2019s liquidity position in assets that provide more value to the protocol.    PSM-GUSD-A: Increase tin to 0.1% and reduce tout to 0.1%:  Disincentivizes further increases in exposure.    The post also explores the idea of increasing the DAI Savings Rate to incentivize retention or increase DAI supply.    Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - GovAlpha Core Unit releases the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add to the Manual.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa and Artem Gordon PDF version   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. Rune submits the Core Tokenomics breakdown for Endgame SubDAOs, previously called MetaDAOs. 2. Two Special Purpose Funds have been proposed: 1. A 5M DAI SPF for establishing a legal self-insurance fund, and 2. A 500k DAI SPF for the Viridian Cluster to manage ongoing RWA tasks. 3. Governance Communications, Sidestream Auction Services, and ImmuneFi Security Core Units are all officially submitted for offboarding. Forum Recap:          Announcements & Updates  Change of Ownership of the Ambassador Program\u2019s Multi-Sig  @kat, who led the Ambassador Program, has decided to step down from her role. She has performed a great job at building the team and informing the Latin America community. In effort to keep the program going, @Sebix of GovAlpha is requesting to be made the multisig wallet owner.    Active Discussions & Proposals  Endgame  Final Endgame Tokenomics  In this post, @rune outlines some of the fundamental parameters and features of the latest and \u201clikely final\u201d iteration of Endgame tokenomics, from yearly emissions (70k MKR) to Core SubDAO Tokenomics.  Potential rename of MetaDAOs to Maker SubDAOs  As part of an ongoing effort to simplify and improve the language used in the Endgame Plan, a suggestion to rename MetaDAOs \u201cMaker SubDAOs\u201d has surfaced. The advantage of this name is that it is somewhat self-explanatory and SubDAOs are a known concept, lowering the explanatory burden. On the other hand, the term\u2019s technical nature may need to be more appealing from a marketing perspective.  LongForWisdom\u2019s Suggestions on WIP Scope Framework  @LongForWisdom made a series of in-depth suggestions for improving Rune\u2019s WIP Scope Framework draft. First, he suggested easy-to-read formatting for the eventual MIP, viewable here. This was followed by detailed suggestions regarding the language of the framework aimed at improving clarity and unambiguity.  Resource and Clarity for Core Units\u2019 Transitions into Endgame  Recognized Delegate @Doo_StableLab shared a post seeking clarity on recent budget rejections and advocating for the creation of resources to help Core Units transition into structures more suited to the Endgame Plan.  Core Unit Offboarding  Sidestream Auction Services - Core Unit Offboarding  This MIP offboards the Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit, which had its proposed budget rejected by an on-chain poll earlier this month. The Core Unit was set up to \u201cimprove the security, transparency, and accessibility of the Maker Protocol by providing and maintaining auction services through open-source development.\u201d  ImmuneFi Security - Core Unit Offboarding  The ImmuneFi Security Core Unit also rejected its budget proposal and is slated for offboarding. The team\u2019s stated mission was to \u201csystematically improve security for builders, end users, and other stakeholders in the Maker Ecosystem by providing both reactive and proactive security services.\u201d  Governance Communications Offboarding  This MIP offboards the GovComms Core Unit in the wake of its rejected budget proposal. It outlines the deliverables and responsibilities, explains how the CU will be wound down over the next two months, and suggests golden parachute and retroactive MKR compensation amounts. A governance vote will take place on Monday regarding winding down spending permissions and approving final expenditures for administrative and offboarding work in January. GovComms hopes to re-enter the community as an ecosystem actor once Endgame is underway.  SubDAOs  SPF: Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster  This MIP establishes a Special Purpose Fund of 500k DAI for the Viridian Cluster to fund the due diligence, completion, and ongoing management and monitoring of:  MIP65 Monetalis Clydesdale: Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards MIP88: Monetalis - Redwood Friesian Any other MIPs submitted in the next six months for which Monetalis will act as Arranger  The fund would enable Maker to continue working on important RWA projects before MetaDAOs launch and provides an opportunity for the community to evaluate the Viridian Cluster\u2019s performance and potential as a Protector MetaDAO.  Protector MetaDAO Operationalisation  Protector MetaDAOs (PMDs) are Endgame entities tasked with allocating collateral to Real World Assets, protecting Maker against physical and legal threats, and carrying out the responsibilities associated with part ownership of RWA Maker Vaults. In this extensive post, @Allan_Pedersen lays out the fundamental requirements for getting PMDs off the ground. Operating System & Key Concepts This section runs through the risk parameters that must be addressed before a PMD can be launched. This Portfolio Risk Requirement Framework should \u201cprovide appropriate safeguards, but should also propel DAI into a state of portfolio design and control that should be recognizable as \u2018safe\u2019 by international regulators.\u201d A sample framework is available here. The section describes frameworks for stress testing, reporting, accounting and definitions, documentation, monitoring and enforcement, and collateral evaluation. Protector MetaDAO Implementation Project This section covers considerations relevant to implementing the frameworks outlined in the previous section:   Building and deploying simultaneously  Maker will likely need to \u201cassemble the plane while flying it.\u201d    Assembling and activating resources  This is the first step in operationalizing PMDs.    Communication and engagement  Sufficient Maker community communication and engagement will be important to the success of PMDs.    RWA council challenges: quality build allows quality hiring  A high-caliber RWA council should be hired, but this may not be easy before substantial progress has been made.    Investment and budget  Defining and managing an overall budget is essential.    An example implementation plan is available here. Maker RWA Exposure Strategy over 12 months This section examines Maker\u2019s RWA-related goals for the next year and provides an example table of targets:  842\u00d7247 39.8 KB   Legal  SPF: Requesting a SIF for Legal Defense Expenses  This MIP seeks the creation of a 5M DAI Special Purpose Fund for setting up a Self-insurance Fund (SIF) to reimburse MakerDAO participants for legal expenses in the case of legal or regulatory action against them. In its initial stages, the fund will cover the following:  Recognized Delegates Core Unit Facilitators Core Unit permanent contributors MKR holders who actively participate in governance   Risk  Subtle Attack Vectors on MakerDAO  In this post, Recognized Delegate @CodeKnight points out the need for more procedures for dealing with less overt attacks on the MakerDAO protocol. For example, he imagines a large MKR holder or group of MKR holders gaming Maker\u2019s RWA investments by voting to give themselves below-market loans or perform other actions to siphon value from the protocol. These attacks are made easier by the high complexity of governance, low governance participation rate, and lack of disclosure requirements.    Research, Reports & Assessments  GUSD Institutional Rewards - Receiving Payments of Rewards  This post from the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit explains the implementation of a smart contract for receiving GUSD institutional rewards from Gemini based on the amount of GUSD deposited in the GUSD PSM. Because the smart contract uses existing live contracts without direct authorizations on any Maker Protocol contract, the technical risk is considered low. The contract would work as follows:   Gemini sends GUSD rewards to the RwaSwapInputConduit2 contract.   The function push in the RwaSwapInputConduit2 can then be permissionlessly called by anyone to trigger a conversion of GUSD to DAI through the GUSD PSM and transfer the generated DAI to the RwaJar contract.   Once the DAI is in the RwaJar contract, anyone can call the function void to transfer the DAI to the surplus buffer.

Summaries reflect our views of the most meaningful activities in MakerDAO. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM. Authors: @nothsa and Artem Gordon PDF version   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019 1. The Strategic Finance Core Unit has released a dashboard allowing anyone to dive deep into Maker\u2019s complete transaction history. 2. Maker\u2019s newest Recognized Delegate, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), has arrived. Check out their platform here. 3. A new MIP aims to fund the development of a better monitoring system for RWA Vaults. Forum Recap:          Announcements & Updates  Maker Transaction Level Accounting Dashboard   \u201cWe are focused on finding adequate representations of the underlying economic reality of an on-chain protocol, with adaptations to the choices we make for representing smart contracts.\u201d  The Strategic Finance Core Unit has used its experience analyzing MakerDAO\u2019s protocol-level financial data to build a dual-entry ledge for on-chain accounting. The team hopes the ledger\u2019s final unique features\u2014real-time data, being independently verifiable and auditable, and open-sourced categorization choices\u2014will bring us closer to developing a \u201cgold standard for DAOs.\u201d The dashboard allows any interested party to dig into individual transactions at the hash level for any figure on the MakerDAO balance sheet. SFCU welcomes feedback on this ongoing project.  November\u2019s Financial Report  The Strategic Finance Core Unit\u2019s monthly financial report for November 2022 is hot off the press. In summary:  RWA Vaults are coming online with a strong presence of productive stablecoin PSM vaults  MIP65 on track to deliver ~20M in annualized net interest income GUSD could deliver ~6M at current rates Blocktower could deliver ~6M at current rates MIP81 could bring another 15-30M at current updated rates, depending on Vault size   The DSR proposal passed, which could increase DAI expenses, depending on the amount of DAI locked There is ongoing compression in crypto-lending driving low-net interest income from Vaults  ~12M in annualized NTM net interest income     HKUST EPI Blockchain Delegate Platform  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) enters the arena as Maker\u2019s newest Recognized Delegate with the following Core Values to drive their platform. HKUST EPI aims to present value to the protocol by:  Establishing a beneficial and friendly environment between Universities and Protocols. Developing innovative solutions through critical thinking. Educating the next generation about the benefits of blockchain technology in TradeFi. Supporting the protocol on Treasury, Budgeting, Process Streamlining, and Collateral Risk Management. And sharing their insights, industry knowledge, and experiences.  HKUST openly embraces the visions and innovation stemming from bleeding-edge technologies, and its students are actively encouraged to explore these new frontiers. Focus will be placed on several initiatives, including:  Actively participating in forum discussions. Initiating new improvement proposals. Monitoring protocol news and updates. Seeking consultations with respective faculty members or with collaborating external parties. Communicating with internal team members. And offering public Q&A with their delegators.  Check out this Meet Your Delegate call for a presentation and Q&A on their delegate platform.    Active Discussions & Proposals  Should Block Analitica have a $2.76M/year + 2400 MKR risk management?  This post from Recognized Delegate @pvl opens a discussion about the Risk Core Unit, its de facto control by private company Block Analitica, and whether the current risk model used by the team is appropriate. Risk Core Unit Facilitator @Primoz stepped in to share his thoughts and defend the CU\u2019s work, and many others offered their feedback in the comments.  Tokenomics and Regulation  In this post, Recognized Delegate @CodeKnight asks what measures are planned for mitigating the legal implications of subDAO tokens potentially being classified as securities. @rune believes that subDAO tokens will not be considered securities provided that \u201creal decentralization is in place,\u201d but CodeKnight isn\u2019t convinced.  MIPs  SAS Spending Permission  The Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit submitted a budget approval poll after their previous budget was rejected by governance. The team has considered Recognized Delegate feedback and shifted gears to focus on contributing to the Endgame as a \u201ctrusted custom software development service provider for MetaDAOs.\u201d  Declaration of Intent to Develop a Comprehensive On-chain Monitoring Solution for RWA Vaults  With this MIP, Recognized Delegate @rspa points out the need for robust on-chain monitoring of RWA Vaults. Monitoring is as much as 13 months behind.  Remove MIP14c4: Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling  This MIP from GovAlpha seeks to remove the DAI transfer ceiling set in place by MIP14, which defines the procedure for transferring DAI from the Maker Protocol to a target Ethereum address. Removing this limit avoids continually raising the ceiling via governance channels every month, an important consideration as GovAlpha expects MIP14 funding requests to increase during the transition to the Endgame.  Utilizing Hats Protocol  This MIP seeks to solidify a procedure for implementing Hats Protocol for Maker roles and permissions. Hats provide a more formal, structured way to maintain real-time, on-chain, verifiable roles in the DAO. This MIP contains four sub-proposals:  853\u00d7300 46.5 KB     Research, Reports & Assessments  MIP81 Coinbase USDC Institutional Awards by CES Domain Team  The CES Domain Team has published a technical assessment of two alternative implementations of MIP81. In the first alternative, MIP65 is implemented in a traditional custodial arrangement managed by a Real World Arranger through resolutions approved by Maker Governance. The second alternative is implementing a Safebox, which requires further development to comply with Coinbase\u2019s legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, Safebox implementation provides the added benefit of improving on-chain transparency and enabling transfers to be completed on-chain without the involvement of any RWA counterparty. Institutional rewards will have to be validated off-chain in both implementations. Check out the complete assessment here.

MIP94 seeks to enable users to reclaim their funds after mistakenly sending DAI to the DAI address. 3. In the latest episode of Drinks w/MakerDAO Delegates, ultraschuppi and ElProgreso are joined by tadeo to talk about his work on the Data Insights Core Unit. Forum Recap:          Announcements & Updates  Data API Breaking Change - Limit Parameter (16th January)  As of January 16th, the limit parameter will be restricted to a value between 1 and 100, as opposed to the unlimited range users previously had available. Default sorting is also being added to all response objects.    Active Discussions & Proposals  Endgame Asset & Liabilities Management (ALM) Technical Design  In this post, hexonaut of the Protocol Engineering Core Unit Team draws on SebVentures ALM Framework to outline technical approaches to bringing Maker into the Endgame. Three primary components must be in place for the transition: D3M V3, an ALM Controller, and PSM V2. For the D3M V3, at least two additions to V2 will be necessary:  A cash flow manager that handles what to do with profits and losses Extended protocol reporting covering Net Asset Valuation (NAV), Liquidity Profile, and Capital at Risk (CaR)  The purpose of the ALM Controller is to define the system\u2019s constraints, such as max total exposure, liquidity, and peg management. Finally, PSM 2.0 must incorporate pooled liquidity, dynamic bonding curves, and algorithmic market operations.
