I am from San Francisco, went to school in Atlanta, and have lived in New York City for the last several years. My family is originally from Hungary, and when I lived in Budapest, my friends got me into crypto early. I have been following Maker since the early days and Bitcoin since 2015. When I moved to NYC, I worked for a venture capital firm where I tried to convince much older ex-Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearn folks to look at crypto. This was 2016-2017 when the market started ripping the ICO boom. After getting laughed out of the room many times by traditional Wall Street folks, I finally convinced my boss, Tim, to come to a crypto event with me in mid-2017. Blockwork\u2019s thesis was that crypto would eventually become one of the largest asset classes, if not the largest asset class, in the entire world. This space would get professionalized and move beyond this retail-only asset class. It would grow by orders of magnitude, the number of people and investors who came into the industry full-time and part-time. Those investors were going to need a better source of information. This led to Blockwork\u2019s creation in 2017. We built one of crypto\u2019s largest information media platforms with a big news team and the largest network of podcasts. I host a podcast with this guy, Santiago Santos, who is ex-Purify. Blockwork\u2019s research goes head-to-head with Masari and Delphi.  5:52  I\u2019m also passionate about growth, product, sales, and marketing. We have a fantastic product on our hands. However, we will need a better growth strategy, improved governance, and more scalable operations to achieve scale. I believe that Maker is a B-to-B platform for presenting these core values. It is a DAO to DAO platform and less of a B to C platform. I see Maker\u2019s future as a B-to-B platform that can serve as the backbone of DeFi. Maker should focus on expanding Dai\u2019s market share over the next couple of years by building connections with more protocols, like what we\u2019ve done with Aave but with more protocols inside and outside Ethereum. Lastly, Maker must improve its governance and incentives by balancing pragmatic governance with the pressing need for long-term decentralization. I covered three things on my delegate platform that you all can see on the forum:  1.) Growth Strategy: Expanding Dai and market shares, promoting MKR outside ETH communities, and incorporating Dai into more protocols. 2.) Governance: I tend to agree with Hasu\u2019s vision of DAO governance. The media seems to portray Hasu\u2019s vision against Rune\u2019s end game. I think they agree with more stuff than they disagree with. One of the first issues is finding a way to get delegates paid by the DAO on things that incentivize long-term success, not just voter participation but quality of decisions. There also needs to be better talent recruitment to the protocol. 3.) Scalable operations: as an outsider looking in, Maker\u2019s culture feels tense and, at times, hostile. There are good reasons for that because it\u2019s created a very anti-fragile system. But I have some ideas on creating bidirectional trust across like, holders, and core units. With unique cultures, no amount of pain can tear people apart. That\u2019s the culture Maker should strive to create.     Questions 12:15   Alan: My ultimate question is how to create demand for Dai.  Yano:  Dai is the destination, real-world assets, and D3M. I think that\u2019s where a lot of the growth in the demand for Dai will end up coming from. Maker has done an exciting thing that many other folks can take inspiration from: it has decentralized up the product stack.    14:06   Raphael: What\u2019s your take on censorship resistance?   Yano: DeFi will eventually take over traditional capital markets because it\u2019s a better product. Maker can be the backbone of the new financial system, which is just an insane concept. We need to create a censorship-resistant platform. However, I am still debating this and don\u2019t have an entirely correct answer.    17:35   Matt: Should Maker expand beyond Ethereum? How could it get a scope with the LT roadmap? I wondered if you had any ideas about which L1s can be used.   Yano: Everyone got caught up with the multi-chain thesis in the summer of 2021 (SOL, AVAX), which happens every bull cycle. Only a couple of them makes it through the bear cycles. I think it\u2019s a colossal waste of time to be chasing L1s.    20:55   Payton Rose: What do you think is the future of L2s in Maker?   Yano: L2s are one of our substantial growth opportunities. I am not as informed on this one as I am on some of the other things I was talking about. I will put that on my list as something to have a little more conviction around. Good question.    24:47   Payton Rose: Do you have any particular strategy to track small MKR holders? Do you think about delegators and the types you want to attract? Are you trying to be an attractive delegate who hasn\u2019t engaged in the system as much yet?   Matt_NZ 30:19        Questions 42:11   Kianga: Many people feel the future for the protocol is to simplify (ex., retreat from real-world assets, ban US users, de-peg). Suppose the DAO votes in the near term on something dramatically different from what you all presented as a vision for MakerDAO. How would that impact your interest in being a delegate over the next six months?   Matt: I\u2019m keen to commit to spending much more time and energy on Maker. Like I said on my platform, I\u2019ve got some strong views on the direction the protocol should take. Part of being a delegate is participating in this discourse where you will not win every discussion or convince everyone that your ideas are correct. However, it is still essential to stay in the debates to continue your perspective forward. If there were a successful proposal to de-peg from the USD, I immediately wouldn\u2019t think it was a great idea. I anticipate that I will give my perspective and vote accordingly. If the end game continues to surpass a series of votes, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with that. However, I wouldn\u2019t abandon Maker. That\u2019s part of how I\u2019ve built my delegate platform. I\u2019m committed to continuing to apply scrutiny to be independent and stay involved in that governance process. Ideally, the scientific governance process works;  people continue to exchange views, even when unsuccessful at the governance site.  Yano: What is your why in doing this? Is it to make money? Is it because you love its people and being a part of something new and exciting? Matt and I have a similar why. I want to improve Maker because I want to improve the entire system. DeFi is one of the best ways to improve the global system. DeFi will unlock wealth and capital for many people outside the United States. Improving Maker is probably the highest leverage and impact to ensure this becomes a reality. If something drastically different happened to Maker that I disagreed with, I would keep chugging along. If I disagree with something, I will trust the system and that other people know what\u2019s best for Maker. That\u2019s why governance works.    47:53   David: What\u2019s the lowest hangest fruit for improving Maker?   Matt: I\u2019ve identified previously on the forum that the low-hanging fruit is making better use of Maker\u2019s brands. Mentions support of engineering and integration levels in addition to Mariano\u2019s work with Growth and Branding.   Yano: I agree with Matt. I think Maker has a strong brand, but it can build upon its brand by becoming something that touches more of the mainstream. The end goal is if the government or big banks tried to lobby against it, they wouldn\u2019t do so because their people are almost rooting for it. I want non-crypto people to root for Maker.    55:57   Payton Rose: You did some work for GovAlpha, which was fantastic on the research end. Do you have any thoughts on conflicts for delegates? When will you be abstaining from any particular votes because of that? How do you approach reoccurring situations where something you\u2019ve done in the past and the small ecosystem runs up to something that comes through governance?   Matt: I\u2019ve got developing views on this because of new delegates like Flipside and GX, who are major participants in governance and other protocols, some of which compete with Maker. It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea for Maker to take a hard line. There\u2019s much value in having governance teams where people have expertise in how situations have been dealt with other protocols. However, it\u2019s also something that Maker needs to track. Suppose every delegate was a professional delegate company that also manages other protocols. In that case, you could have a situation where another protocol competing with Maker also has representation from those various delegate groups.     Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.
