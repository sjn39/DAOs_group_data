                    "content": " Introduction The @Risk-Core-Unit mandate includes, but is not limited to, providing risk assessments, parameter proposals, and relevant tooling to assist MakerDAO in the management of a risk mitigated portfolio of collateral backing DAI. Tasks of the Risk Core Unit include:  Risk parameter proposals Collateral onboarding evaluations General research of the cryptoasset ecosystem Monitoring risk metrics related to the Maker Protocol\u2019s crypto collateral debt exposure Monitoring DeFi systemic risk Developing risk tooling  Most of these tasks have historically been performed using internal models, data sheets, and other proprietary tools. The findings, data, and output has been communicated to the Maker community through presentations, reports, and forum posts. This process still plays a central and valuable role in the output of our work. Nevertheless, over time it became apparent that manual analytics using internal models was not a long-term solution. A better way forward, that would provide clear benefits to our own analysts and the community at large, would be to have a scalable database and an easily accessible and open dashboard to access relevant metrics and information. Hence, in May 2021, the Maker Risk Dashboard was introduced \u2013 a real-time dashboard with Maker-specific features such as (i) vault type metrics, (ii) collateral asset metrics, and (iii) automated quantitative models. The initial version of the Maker Risk Dashboard acted as a minimum viable product with a clear roadmap in mind. In September 2021, a second version of the Maker Risk Dashboard was deployed \u2013 with a new design and several new features, metrics, models, and graphs. Since then, the development of the Maker Risk Dashboard v2 has been an iterative process with improvements almost every week. All improvements have been documented and shared with the community through either weekly or monthly updates. Previous weekly updates can be found in the comment section of the Maker Risk Dashboard forum post. Monthly updates are available through the \u201cMonth in Review\u201d series which the Risk Core Unit has published at the start of every new month since August 2021. All updates can be found in the Block Analitica Forum Archive or through the risk-001 tag on the Maker governance forum.  The Maker Risk Dashboard v3 As the Maker Risk Dashboard v2 developed over time, complexity increased. Essentially, there was an excess of information that might not be relevant to the majority of users who wish to understand and assess the risks associated with multi-collateral DAI and the Maker Protocol. In order to reduce complexity and make information more accessible, we decided to carefully curate and abstract the most relevant elements from v2 while adding new and valuable features. The result of this work is the launch of the Maker Risk Dashboard v3. It represents more than a year\u2019s worth of growth and development from the first iteration. A key objective of the third iteration of the Maker Risk Dashboard is to enhance user experience. To achieve this goal we have:  Redesigned the website to provide a better and more accessible user experience Abstracted data, concepts, and models to reduce complexity and simplify the dashboard Added new features to provide access to data not previously available in v2   New Features of the Third Iteration New features added to the Maker Risk Dashboard v3 include, but are not limited to:   A new website design - Example screenshot of the home page below: 1600\u00d7793 156 KB    Vault Types - Added a \u201cchange over time\u201d function with the option to toggle between 1 day, 7 days, and 30 days. It is now possible to see (i) DAI debt change over time for a specific vault type and (ii) change over time in the number of vaults for a specific vault type: 1600\u00d71031 168 KB    PSM - A new page dedicated to metrics associated with Peg Stability Modules: 1600\u00d7556 127 KB    D3M - A new D3M page with a simpler user interface, focusing on highlighting relevant metrics and abstracting certain data:  1600\u00d71195 167 KB    Oracles - New and reorganised data on the Oracles page. For example (i) medianizer price, (ii) time until next price change, and (iii) oracle price history:  1600\u00d7748 125 KB  1600\u00d7979 127 KB    Liquidations - More real-time liquidation data and new liquidation graphs:  1600\u00d7788 120 KB    Whales - Share of risky debt metric:  1600\u00d7875 161 KB     Future Changes The Maker Risk Dashboard v3 will be an iterative project that will grow and evolve over time. We will add new elements as they become relevant. We value any questions, specific requests, or suggestions regarding the Maker Risk Dashboard v3. Please add any comments below or get in touch directly with members of the @Risk-Core-Unit. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the Maker Risk Dashboard is intended to cover risk-specific analytics rather than supporting a wider array of business intelligence for MakerDAO. We believe that Makerburn is the best resource available for analysing Maker\u2019s P&L and growth-related activities. We advise community members interested in such metrics to visit the Makerburn website. ",
