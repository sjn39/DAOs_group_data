                    "content": "Hello everyone, I am one of the people who missed the airdrop (not gonna lie, still a little salty) and spend the last 2 days trying to figure out why. I thought that I clearly qualify because I remember spending so much time learning how to trade on Uniswap, looking up tutorials and then wrapping my Ether that I just sent to Uniswap and trying to buy several coins. I failed to buy those coins because I had no idea how to set the gas fees and now none of them show up on Etherscan. I then unwrapped my Ether losing a few bucks on gas and fees and sent it back to my other wallet. All of that was before 1st of September (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe3bc06559991e90ba4302baf91f051ed63e8a2f7f6fd080babb024bce27450ff) . Now, the reason why I didn\u2019t qualify, is because all of what I did doesn\u2019t count as swaping, which I find very unfair and ofc the contract is already out there and nothing can be changed, but I still think they take that in consideration if a second airdrop is ever considered in the future. Thank you all for reading and I wish you a good evening (from Germany) ",
