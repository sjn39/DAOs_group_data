Trying to remember and discern them gives me headaches. I tried to offer a solution here: https://osolmaz.com/bijective-mnemonics/ I need your feedback on this. There is also an issue: The first word of most mnemonics start with the letter \u2018a\u2019, which kind of defeats the purpose. This is not due to an error, 20 byte addresses fall into a range where the base conversion results in this accumulation for the first word. I have a few solutions in mind, but first would like to hear your opinion. ",
