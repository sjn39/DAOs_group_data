It seems like a bundle of several ERCs (some old and some new), plus a campaign promoting it widely to devs and end-users could address what is missing here. Here are some relevant ERCs to study: ERC-2477 - Token Metadata Integrity  This specification defines a mechanism by which clients may verify that a fetched token metadata document has been delivered without unexpected manipulation. This is the Web3 counterpart of the W3C Subresource Integrity (SRI) specification.  ERC-1046 - ERC20 Metadata Extension  Optionally extend ERC20 token interface to support the same metadata standard as ERC721 tokens.  Also, there is a lot of early work on asset metadata standards, e.g. the JSON file describing the assets of the NFT. ",

Feedback very welcome! Thanks!     EIP-3340: NFT Editions Standard Extension EIPs       This is a simple extension with the intent of improving provenance in ERC-721 tokens representing works of digital art.  As NFTs evolve further into representing digital art, there is a need to strengthen the link between a token and the digital work itself. With the current standard, a symbolic URI is the only information present linking the art to the blockchain. The URIs may become lost over time and the link may be lost. Hashing the digital art is a good link but pre-images may be lost. This\u2026     ",

I am excluding one specific NFT token sale in this analysis until evidence can be provided it was not a shill sale. Rest assured that our NFT standards are designed to be relevant until at least 2028 in terms of use cases.  Regarding security Your proposal begin the discussion on security with \u201csecurity - but I\u2019m not exaclty [sic] sure how the non fungibles can have added security\u201d. This is not actionable advice.  Standards, yay My experience is that many people want to create applications without hiring developers, and publish standards without making applications. This is wholly backwards. For example, this thread starts with the motivation that ERC-721 is \u201clacking security\u201d. I consider this fake news given the above reference in the details. Going forward, I recommend this could be addressed another way. The concern \u201cI find missing in both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards\u201d\u2026 \u201cno attached hash to the image / multimedia file itself as a proof\u201d is better addressed by going to the Stack Exchange and asking \u201cHow do I attach the hash of a multimedia file to a ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token?\u201d The concern \u201cmissing downloadable standard which I define as more of a nice to have feature\u201d is better addressed by creating a concrete token product, creating a good user experience, dealing with the practical considerations of building a thing (typically involving spending money and hiring people) and then making it work. Then after you have solved the problem, come back to the community and show off how well it worked, possibly as a standard. ",

                    "content": "@fulldecent thank you for comments. You are totally right, NFTs have wide range of usage. There are many ways how to look at the ERC721 as standard itself and we can meditate on this standard for so long as we can come up with a tons of arguments why this standard is good and why not (pros / cons). I made this thread in order to gain more attention to NFT Standards when I began my research down the NFT Standards rabbit hole. I\u2019m not Solidity dev so I need to gain more knowledge before committing to creating new standard and proposal. Things are now more developed than they were 10d ago and I\u2019m sharing updates. I talked to a bunch of people from the NFT industry and figured out that adding Permits as on-chain messages would make the biggest sense how to increase security. I\u2019m sure that over time we can find more extensions that can be added to the standard and solve issues. I\u2019m working on proposal which will be extension to both ERC721 and ERC1155 as both have ApprovalForAll function. My proposal is to add Permits as security extension to the standards that are already live. Permits will be used as off chain message signatures that will approve (confirm) purchase of the NFT. Author of the NFT will sign message with his wallet which will trigger sale function. This standard will look similar to ERC712 (EIP2612) but it will be usable for non fungible token standards. This security extension can be used not only in art world of NFTs but it can find usage in other not-only-art industries. Proposal which will be shared to ethereum/eips GitHub repo as ERC when proposal will be ready which may be soon. Edit: Proposal may change, the research is ongoing.

I would think more often than not, extensions may decrease the security of the base protocol. Any addition to the standard introduces complexity. Any additional complexity might increase the attack surface. Sometimes extensions are created specifically to address security concerns and do minimize the attacks possible. The easiest example of this was the safeMath code that prevented over/underflow before 0.8.0. Sometimes extensions improve security dependent on the use case, an example of this would be contract introspection. In particular meta transactions are a great feature, but in this case I think they create a new set of security challenges that you must be aware of (domain separation, replay prevention, typed data, separation from standard Ethereum messages etc). Putting security first while adding extensions is of course a great idea if this is what you mean by \u201csecurity extension\u201d. ",

I have seen several attempts to define that, but none have been accepted/adopted. I would appreciate your comments on the proposed EIP draft and open questions at the bottom of the post.     EIP-5646 Discussion: Token state fingerprint EIPs       DeFi protocols currently do not have a convenient way to identify tokens that derive value from underlying assets unambiguously.
