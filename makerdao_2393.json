Additionally, it adds two new components based on MIP17. The first component enables the use of MIP12 subproposals to adjust the Target Debt Ceiling and Target Risk Premium (MIP12c4). The second component creates a list of the enabled collateral types and their risk parameters (MIP12c5). This amendment MIP impacts the MIP12 subproposal process. More specifically, it creates a process for collateral types to have their Target Debt Ceiling and Target Risk Premium (TRP) risk parameters adjusted (based on MIP17) and eliminates some dependencies that were inconsistent across the Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set (MIP6, MIP8, MIP9). Amended Components   Motivation  Remove the specific reference of MIP9\u2019s involvement in the MIP12 process.    MIP12c1: Domain Team Requirements for Onboarding Collateral Type to the Maker Protocol  Removal of MIP12 dependencies on MIP6, MIP9, MIP8   Reasoning: As of today, there remain some inconsistencies within the Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set. More specifically, the MIP9 Community Greenlight Polls are non-binding and do not block Domain Greenlight (MIP8) or the ability for Domain teams to perform work on collateral types. Therefore, this makes a clear case to remove the dependencies to further improves the efficiency of collateral onboarding to the Maker Protocol.      MIP12c2: Proposing New Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters  Add minor phrasing updates to improve clarity.    Add MIP12c4 component - Creates the Target Debt Ceiling and Target Risk Premium Requirements  This component defines the requirements for which collateral types can have their Target Debt Ceiling (TDC) and Target Risk Premium (TRP) risk parameters adjusted. In short, MIP17 is a proposal that adds extra flexibility to collateral types that are MIP17 enabled, by giving Maker Governance the recurring option to dynamically adjust their Actual Debt Ceilings and Actual Risk Premiums based on the utilization of the collateral type. Note that only collateral types that have been specified as being MIP17 enabled through a MIP12c2 (Proposing New Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters) have the Target Debt Ceiling and Target Risk Premium risk parameters.    Add MIP12c5 component - A list of MIP17 enabled collateral types, and their risk parameters  This component defines explicitly the requirements for getting a collateral type added to the List Enabled Collateral Types. The list contains the current active MIP17 enabled collateral types, and their MIP17 risk parameters (TDC and TRP).

More specifically, it states that collateral onboarding can continue to operate despite not having an official General Risk Model ratified through the MIP11 process. This amendment MIP specifically impacts MIP12 subproposals. The update will allow MIP12 subproposals to be proposed to the governance cycle without needing a General Risk Model officially ratified in order for risk domain teams to provide risk constructs for the greenlit collateral assets. Amended Components   Paragraph Summary  Updated to reflect all of the domain teams involved in the collateral onboarding process.    Component Summary  Add minor phrasing updates to the MIP12c1 summary to improve clarity surrounding the Domain team requirements for onboarding collateral to the Maker Protocol.    Motivation  Add minor phrasing updates to make the language used across the Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set to be more consistent. Clarify that the MIP12 subproposal process is reserved for domain teams to propose new risk parameters, oracles, and adaptors for a new, or existing collateral type.    MIP12c1: Domain Team Requirements for Onboarding Collateral Type to the Maker Protocol  Add minor phrasing updates to the domain team descriptions to further explain the domain team requirements for collateral onboarding.    MIP12c2: Proposing New Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters  Add minor phrasing updates to reflect that the MIP12 subproposal process is reserved for domain teams. Update the descriptions of the three deliverables required when proposing new risk parameters, oracles, and collateral Adapters for collateral types. More specifically, changing the risk team\u2019s requirements to allow MIP12 subproposals to be proposed to the governance cycle without needing a General Risk Model officially ratified in order to provide risk constructs for collateral assets (note that this holds true until a second, non-Foundation domain risk team has been ratified through the MIP7 process).
