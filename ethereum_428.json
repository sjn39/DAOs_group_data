You can sign up for it here: Council of Paris - HackMD Why: I believe that finding sustainable business models is a very important thing to the long term health of this ecosystem.    Also, I\u2019m trying to figure out the business model for Gitcoin  Like many others in the ecosystem, I was not excited about doing an ICO for our project.  There have got to be other business models out there that do a better job of aligning the interests of end-users and dapp founders. Some early ones I\u2019m excited about:  state channels / streaming money subscriptions NFTs  I believe that we are building a world financial computer, which will eventually have dozens of use cases \u2013 and that tokens are just the first one.  It\u2019s hard to imagine what those are going to be (can you imagine sending an e-mail in the year 1985?), but I think it\u2019s safe to say that there will be novel uses of the world financial computer that we\u2019ve not yet thought of yet.  And I believe they will be used with 10x or 100x the volume of that financial instruments we use today (just like we send 100x more emails than we do snail-mail today). This ring\u2019s objective* will be to map out various emergent business models for dapps, their pros/cons, and to publish this research for the good of the ecosytem. * all of this is a proposal, and is subject to creating consensus within the ring.
