Use of the standard lends to writing  small, reusable smart contracts that are responsible for enforcing a single transfer restriction pattern. Tokens implementing the standard are best constructed by composing said restrictions through multiple contract inheritance. The examples in the above repo demonstrate several of these individual restriction implementations. Would love to see criticism of the utility of these examples, their source code, and the standard itself! ",
