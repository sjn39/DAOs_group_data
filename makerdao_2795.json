Three days ago I see this transaction that I don\u2019t think I made And today I realized for the first time, my CDP no longer shows up. It had 160 ETH in it, so I am hoping it\u2019s not totally lost\u2026but I suppose it doesn\u2019t look good. Any ideas what that transaction is doing? None of my other assets on my metamask account seem to have been touched. edit So I\u2019ve traced a transaction I don\u2019t think I made. Where, it looks like some state data in the Maker CDP Manager was changed from my DS Proxy address to a completely different contract. My DS Proxy is the address ending in 2bb1. Did somebody just reassign the owner contract of my CDP?? https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc43d379478f4c8af40eee1869a3007eb68a74227cffc1bafa97bace4f44eedcb/advanced#statechange further edit It seems like the CDP ID was changed or deleted or something as well\u2026 Screen Shot 2020-10-05 at 2.00.40 AM1610\u00d7962 92.7 KB The ID used to be 13289, but now that doesn\u2019t show up as the right one.
