First one is related to description \u201cThis method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.\u201d. This description used in many functions like name(), symbol(), decimals(), etc. This description could have two possible explanations:  These functions should not be called beyond the contract Caller must check return value of these functions  Which one of them is the more appropriate one? If both of them are wrong, what would be the correct understanding? Second one is the issue posted in reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/solidity/comments/yh2ysd/should_i_emit_transfer_event_in_this_balance Appreciate if anyone can drop your valuable comments/thoughts ",
