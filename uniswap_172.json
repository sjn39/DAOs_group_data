Pro:  Another Round of Hype for UNI in 3 months when more users claim their tokens. Another round of hype in 9 months when the unclaimed tokens are burned. Uniswap users from the last two weeks don\u2019t miss out on the UNI distribution. A low cost gesture of goodwill towards newer DeFi users.  Con:  More work for an already slammed dev team.

The reward of 400 UNI was designed to reward patrons of the Uniswap protocol, and many users got lucky as they had used many different wallets when interacting with Uniswap granting them extra tokens. However, if we were to do this again, and this time with users having the knowledge that they can create extra accounts for extra UNI, this would incentivise users to create wasteful trades with new addresses just to earn UNI. I think there would just be too much illegitimate traffic by bots trying to farm as much UNI as possible and this wouldn\u2019t really help Uniswap all that much. ",

If you were to set the snapshot a week forward, wouldn\u2019t those that were one day short also feel left out? Also it opens the door to arbitrating whether or not certain users who submitted more transactions should be retroactively compensated and more. I do feel sorry for some users that perhaps just missed the cutoff but most were probably not heavy users of the platform. I think we need to press forward with the current snapshot even if it is slightly unfair. Also, I think that there are still viable ways to obtain UNI and be part of the protocol as a latecomer, such as being an LP, being part of the governance, and or  buying it off of the market. ",

You could say: If someone who missed the snapshot ACTIVELY claims the reward AND traded at Uniswap from september 1st up to the announcement he will be rewarded. Others cases will not be rewarded. If you do it this way there is no way for bots or scammers or whoever to trick the system. Just gave the users of Uniswap the chance to get their rewards as long as they traded at Uniswap from September 1st up to the day of the announcement. Everything else is massively unfair.

                    "content": "Now I just wanted to say my two cents: The cutoff date is more than fair because if it was announced say 1 day before it was going to take the snapshot, only a group a people (could be a couple hundred, thousand, million idk) that understand crypto would abuse the hell out of the snapshot since there is no limits to the amount of accounts you create or the amount of private keys people can generate. Keeping it random like this implies that no one else had a much better chance than you (now I know the devs could have told people, but I\u2019m thinking of this in general with billions of people rather than just a couple of individuals). In the banking world, those with insider trading would be able to do way more (continue to buy until the date to sell) but here, they are limited to 400 UNI each. I believe this is fair due to the fact that there has been so much time to use this protocol and, to be honest, this has way more risk like every other dex there is. If you had barely come to Uniswap, I can infer maybe 2 things. 1) you are new and that you barely stumbled upon Uniswap but still needed to research and understand what it is (DYOR). or 2) you have been here for awhile and have used other services until you stumbled upon Uniswap and either skipped it or barely missed the time. If you missed the time, I feel sorry for you since yes you were the closest to getting the UNI but missed it. But couldn\u2019t you say the same about people who didn\u2019t purchase or missed the bottom. Asking to extend the date of the snapshot is like asking any asset to go back to their bottom so you can buy in. I, personally, have been using crypto for less than a year and found uniswap in the spring-summer. As a new user, I saw the risk of putting my funds into something that I might not get anything back but still took it anyways. That is why my wallet received 400 UNI. And I didn\u2019t expect anything from using this protocol and no one really should in crypto since this is where you are responsible for all you do here with no safety net. You may disagree with me but that is fine but I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s suppose to be fair, could you offer a better way it could be fair without any abuse. Until then this is what I think about this. ",

Here\u2019s the original proposal-     Reeser:  Proposal to take another snapshot after 3 months for 9/15/2020 and provide wallets that were not eligible during the first snapshot an allocation of UNI, and then burn all UNI tokens designated to be distributed by the claiming mechanism that remain unclaimed after 6 months. Pro:  Another Round of Hype for UNI in 3 months when more users claim their tokens. Another round of hype in 9 months when the unclaimed tokens are burned. Uniswap users from the last two weeks don\u2019t miss out on the UNI distribution. A low cost gesture of goodwill towards newer DeFi users.  Con:  More work for an already slammed dev team. It may spike ETH gas prices again. Likely more that I\u2019m missing  Search Words (Missed out, Snap shot, new DeFI User)   I need to add a con I missed: The possibility that the distribution could be gamed by the small group of people who had knowledge of the distribution prior to the announcement (Auditors and the like) To minimize that risk I would tweak the original proposal to restrict the eligible addresses to those that were older than 9/1 and limit the distribution to just 400/wallet instead of the dynamic allocation It seems we have some common themes that need to be addressed here as well so we don\u2019t lose our civility and keep the discussion on track THEMES On the dissent front most of the comments seem to be along these lines of the following:  Don\u2019t understand that the proposed adjusted snapshot would be from the initial cutoff of 9/1 to the announcement date and thus impossible to game  Don\u2019t understand that this proposal is not calling for minting new UNI, just allocating the unclaimed UNI after 3 months to this small batch of users. and thus not dramatically changing the amount of UNI in circulation  I got something free an valuable if anyone else get\u2019s any it\u2019s going to make the thing I just got for free worth less! \"I don\u2019t think the pie will ever get any bigger so I have to protect what I have\"  These people just want a hand out! If they really wanted UNI they could buy it or farm it! Most seem to be mad  about the proposal, which is strange since they all just received a \u201cHandout\u201d and they seem to think that the receipt of UNI will mean that they won\u2019t buy or farm UNI  These people don\u2019t actually believe in decentralization so how could the help govern a protocol? We currently have nothing at stake and yet here we are, assisting in the governance process   In summary, (Sorry this is so long) I\u2019m floored by the engagement, both positive and not. I just wanted to encourage us to keep it civil, and productive. I know this would have to be picked up by a delegate, so the best thing we can do now is sort through the issues so it\u2019s ready to be voted on if/when it gets selected. ",

If there are unclaimed tokens and we can distribute THOSE among users, there needs to be some kind of regulation to avoid these users go and take advantage of the current prices. As a Uniswap holder I feel less incentivized to keep my UNI or purchase more knowing that people will be receiving UNI at the prices we\u2019ve helped maintain and will most likely plummet the price. I\u2019m not really supportive of anymore Airdrops at all. People will keep coming up saying that for some reason it\u2019s not fair they didn\u2019t get free tokens. ",

If I would have received the Airdrop and others would have told me that it\u2019s unfair and I know that there will be a lot of unclaimed tokens I would say: give them what the deserve. They are still early adopters and they are part of the community. Why this malevolence? You want us to go because we say that the snapshot was unfair? This is my honest opinion: I thought and still think after my first trade that this is a great project and I was willing to use it in the future when the transaction fees are lower. I am trading with the few money I have and I can\u2019t afford transaction fees of 10 % and more. My harsh post about the blockchain industry is my honest opinion and you see it everywhere in the whole blockchain community.

So I think it would be very helpful and reward also new users or those users who were late for token airdrop. I support the idea! But I rather think about those people joining/using uniswap between 1st and 15th than announcing another aidrop in the next 3 months. So I hope the prayers will be answered. Cheers! ",

To move forward, someone with technical knowhow need to provide us with the information:  how many addresses interact with uniswap from 09/01 to 09/15? how much will be the total airdrop for these addresses plus taking into account also additional airdrop to existing liquidity provider for this period? how many new addresses interact with uniswap only ONCE during this period? how many addresses showed past activities before 09/01 e.g. interacting with other protocols etc?  A decision based on numbers would be more convincing than \u201cits fair\u201d. Remember that the original intention is to avoid insiders taking advantage of the knowledge of the snapshot date 09/01.

I know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had lots of ETH and other tokens tied up in Uniswap LPs, not because we ever expected governance but because we wanted to contribute to a better monetary system. This, at the end of the day this should be about the betterment of DeFi as not just a \u201cfairer\u201d financial system, just a better one. One of the fundamental problems with traditional systems is the instability that arises when a very specific group gets added to the community.

I\u2019ll run an analysis in the morning with exact numbers for all of the above requested data, in the meantime, filter the Uniswap contract on etherscan to accounts 1st-15th receiving wBTC. Another simple metric to look at is the average nonce of the transactions between 1st-15 vs all-time. The play by play of deposits shows a high number of even amounts (1, 3, 5 BTC) deposited from multiple addresses at regular intervals. This is a whale move, breaking a large amount of BTC up to maximize number of ETH wallets tied to Uniswap. ",

Any random user who started using Uniswap on 30-Aug likely has not contributed a fraction as much to the network as any randomly picked user who\u2019s used the system between inception and the airdrop notice. At some point when switching from the centralized government that bootstrapped the system to a decentralized government you must draw an arbitrary line somewhere. Unless the goal or extending the airdrop is setting up an elaborate distribution scheme based on how much value was contributed to the network over some X length of time, it\u2019s just another arbitrary decision to be made that has no real consequence over the governance of the network and could be potentially harmful. Now, we can either carry on with the decision that was made (mind you, in the context of de-centralizing governance), or make what is essentially another arbitrary decision; we just get to choose the context. Is it \u201cfairness\u201d? Is it \u201cinclusion\u201d? By what metric would either of those be determined. Let\u2019s say we decide that all users up until 15-SEP should be included in the airdrop. We can clearly see a spike in use during that time and while I know that there were good actors included in that number, there were a lot of bad actors, using Uniswap hoping for a proposal like this to come up. In order to even have a valid argument we need a valid context, which we don\u2019t have. The fact that some people feel left out by the decision should be irrelevant when it comes to community governance, which is the context of this entire discussion. The airdrop is a distribution of governance, so the essential question is: Who do we want to be in charge of the community? The answer is simple, people who care about the network, good actors. The fact that tokens are currently on exchanges means that some people who received the airdrop decided that value was worth more than the network. This was good for the community, because it weeded out those who did not care to govern it. If we extend the airdrop period to include additional users, how exactly is this improving the quality of governance? I would wager that the majority of people asking for an extension are envious not of the (perceived) missed opportunity to govern the system, but of the missed value. As the fiat price of UNI declines there is ample opportunity to get in on the ground floor of governing Uniswap, I\u2019ve already bought more UNI than I was airdropped. An extension would at the end of the day be an arbitrary decision and I don\u2019t see why, now that governance is decentralized, any more arbitrary decisions are required. Any good actor who did not get the airdrop, but wants to be a participating member of the Uniswap network would consider the sheer amount of value locked in DeFi, the clout that Uniswap holds within that sector, and realize that the current exchange price is an absolute steal to get in this early.

I feel like I\u2019m beating a dead horse but it is imperative to understand how Uniswap works if you intend on helping govern it. Simply \u201chearing of the platform and using it\u201d is nowhere near \u201cdoing the same as all the other users before.\u201d Many users before, myself included, have had multiple ETH:Token pairs locked in liquidity pools, often for many months and in some cases since the inception of LPs. These users locked away portions of their income so that the system would have enough liquidity to function in the first place. If \u201cfairness\u201d is what you\u2019re worried about, a revised airdrop should heavily reward users proportionally based on how much they\u2019ve had locked in liquidity pools compounded over time, and reward swap-only users a small portion based on how much they proportionally paid in fees.

Most of cryptocurrency prices are due to price speculation and technical analysis. Only a very small percentage of users will be holding UNI with the actual purpose of participating in the governance system. ",

If you\u2019re concerned about governance, 400 UNI will not let you do much. Holders of 400 UNI will have to obtain more to have meaningful say in what happens on the network. If all those who list UNI on exchanges are doing so to take profit, the price will continue to favor buyers, until a price is determined that is \u201cworth\u201d a slice of governance in the network. In what ways will it help the community governance by adding additional users. Please try to keep feelings of \u201cunfairness\u201d or \u201cbeing left out\u201d aside, as they are not relevant to how the distribution affects governance.     maxiswap:  ahaha are you serious? tokens are in the exchange for pure price speculation and not to allow people to be part of the governance   Price speculation determines the value people are willing to pay for a piece of governance in Uniswap. This is Markets 101. As those who give up governance to sell on markets, future holders can purchase UNI, even though they were not involved in the airswap. Yes, those who sold the tokens did so \u201cselfishly\u201d in that they acted in their best interest. On the converse, this was \u201caltruistic\u201d to the community, as instead of them holding tokens for a community in which they won\u2019t take part in, users who do want to hold can now buy into the system. These may be users who didn\u2019t get the airdrop. IMO this is completely fine; if you didn\u2019t get the airdrop, you didn\u2019t contribute to the system\u2026 they had to put the cutouff point somewhere! A lot of users who received UNI have had their funds locked in pools, they\u2019ve paid their dues to allow you to use the system in the first place. This is a governance token. All arguments I have seen to extend the airdrop have nothing do with improved governance, all I see are people who missed out on the valueand are bitter. I got into BTC right after the BCH split, I could have had 5 BCH because of the split, did I complain? No, because that\u2019s life. I got into LINK early and sold most of it when it hit $5. Was I pissed when it went to $20 and I could have had several hundred thousand dollars? No, because that\u2019s life. Keep in mind that DeFi is in it\u2019s infancy\u2026 stop complaining about a \u201cmissed\u201d opportunity and put your energy into looking forward to the hundreds, if not thousands of other opportunities that will present themselves over the next few years as the space matures.

Postgrid:  So don\u2019t get mad you were left out of a community of people of which plenty of people did the same thing you did, just moments earlier, and received a reward of substantial monetary value and inclusion in utility.   This is exactly right, there is no sense in getting upset that you missed the boat by a day, hour, week, etc. The fact is the team that bootstrapped this system made a decision on how to allocate the token drop. We\u2019re not even a week from the initial redemption, if you\u2019re worried about \u201csubstantial monetary value\u201d, it is declining. We have no idea what the price will look like in a week; it could very much be possible that some of your other investments mature to the point where you can get 400 UNI for relatively cheap. Was it free? No, but you haven\u2019t actually missed the boat either yet. I\u2019ll be watching this thread in case someone can provide a convincing argument why an arbitrary airdrop date should be switched for another arbitrary one, but I\u2019ve beaten this horse to death and I don\u2019t know how many other ways to illustrate my point. I\u2019ll refer to an earlier comment by @Uniguy772\u2026 If there were no price associated with this token, and it was simply a governance mechanism, I don\u2019t even think this conversation would be happening. All arguments for an extended airdrop so far have been rooted in the monetary value that was missed, I have yet to see an argument for extending the airdrop that would improve governance. Please, I want someone to come forth with a logical argument that isn\u2019t rooted in lost value, I want someone to change my mind on this. But until I see an argument on how it would actually improve the governance platform I have made all my points and will be awaiting the automatic close of this thread. From where I\u2019m looking, market forces are enabling users a means to still obtain UNI and get in on the ground floor of a very new system with a unique mechanism of governance, which is more than can be said for many other governance tokens that never provided an airdrop and relied on users supplying the system from their own assets alone.

But neither is running any meaningful node, validator, or oracle in the blockchain space. This thread is essentially users who were aware of the airdrop complaining over a missed opportunity. The wonderful thing about this airdrop: that users who expected nothing from using it other than utility got a surprise in the form of governance tokens is completely overshadowed by petty squabbling. If you missed the UNI drop, take this as a lesson for the future! If you believe in a system, support it, advertise it, help maintain it, become part of it\u2019s community. Maybe you\u2019ll be rewarded monetarily! But even if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re still part of something amazing. ",

Without expecting it. Without knowing about it. Just. Like. You.   They believed in it and supported it, but have they risked their assets by having 40% of their portfolio locked away in LPs since mid-2019 so that Uniswap could function? Did they pay ever-increasing gas fees equivalent to upwards of 30% of the current value of 400 UNI over the last year? The community should be grateful for all users wanting to become part of the system and support it, just like before this airdrop came and put a divide in the community. Don\u2019t forget that many UNI remains unclaimed, the price is decreasing on secondary markets, and there is still plenty of time to get in on governance. Also, once 17-OCT rolls around, the community decides what happens to unclaimed and remaining UNI, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that those get sent to users who just missed the snapshot. As a decentralized government, we could decide to reward users who missed the airdrop but continued to use Uniswap UNI every time they make a trade or provide liquidity. Missing the initial airdrop is not the end of the world, it is simply the beginning. Bottom line, there\u2019s no way that the liquidity and volume the users in question provided to the network during this brief period of time between the snapshot and the press release compared to what users who\u2019ve used the system and provided liquidity since 2019 have contributed. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s just the truth of the matter. Whether or not the date is arbitrary or not still doesn\u2019t answer the question of how it improves governance, which is the crux of the UNI token. How is adding a small number of users improving the governance of UNI? All pro arguments revolve around this perceived financial loss, and it\u2019s missing the point entirely. Changing the snapshot date only caters to people who feel left out by the date of the snapshot, and IMO there is no reason for the community to cater to anyone\u2019s capacity to be upset that they missed a single opportunity in an ocean full of them; new systems = risk; this is foundational in crypto. I\u2019m trying to approach this logically, while it may seem \u201ccold, heartless, or greedy\u201d, that is simply how communities stay strong. Once you start catering to lower denominations, that sets a precedent for the next lowest common denominator, and the next, ad infinitum, until the quality of the community suffers as a result. If the airdrop is to be changed, it should be done so in a manner that leaves no room for arbitrary dates surrounding the announcement, as this only reflects desire for monetary value and does not improve the governance. An airdrop reallocation should be based solely on on-chain statistics. If \u201cfairness\u201d was the goal of the airdrop, then it would have gone like this:  Have your 9/15 Snapshot. UNI is distributed proportionally based on the amount of contribution to the system.  Liquidity providers make the system work, and should get the bulk of UNI proportional to how much they have contributed compounded by the amount of time they have contributed. Users who only used the exchange get a substantially smaller UNI airdrop, but still receive some proportionally based on the amount of fees paid to LPs.    This would (a) give less UNI to users who made a single transaction months ago, (b) provide large liquidity providers, who essentially made this possible the bulk of the reward, \u00a9 mitigate the multiple account problem\u2014 as transaction-only accounts receive a substantially smaller portion than LPs, and if one user is using multiple accounts to provide liquidity, they are increasing the value of the system and should be rewarded as such\u2014and (d) remove the \u201carbitrary\u201d nature of the core team picking a snapshot date that made people feel not included. That would be a more \u201cfair\u201d airdrop. But guess what, people are still going to complain! Because you can\u2019t please everybody. Even if the airdrop was done as I described, using metrics and logic and proportional activity, some people will get less than others, and they\u2019ll be unhappy. So, for the N-teenth time; this is not the end of the world; there are unclaimed tokens; sometimes you miss out in crypto, sometimes you get lucky. Don\u2019t get so tied up in what you could have had that you forget what is still out there. ",

I genuinely believe everything I\u2019ve posted; I\u2019m also completely willing to flip my opinion if a valid reason surfaces as to why this specific proposal would improve the governance of the Uniswap ecosystem, while right now all the UNI that was dumped onto exchanges are providing an invaluable opportunity to further decentralize the system before whales scoop it all up when it reaches a sufficiently low price. I understood what you\u2019re getting at with the above post, and I picked up on the sarcasm. The illustration of my personal experiences was to point out that the world doesn\u2019t stop for anyone. Opportunities come and go, yes this one happened to be of substantial monetary value, meant simply to reward long time users. I feel the frustration of those that missed the airdrop; I\u2019ve missed airdrops before because I deposited funds hours too late into an on-chain account before. It sucks, but that\u2019s just how it happened. I agree with you that this airdrop was not \u201cideal\u201d in a number of ways; however points such as \u201cuser on 31-AUG make one Tx and get 400 UNI while users a few hours later get nothing\u201d are moot\u2014at some point there has to be a cutoff of limiting factor, and someone will always be left out. There is no way to maintain (a) a healthy market ecosystem for $UNI trading pairs, and (b) please everyone. ",

Everyone is in agreement that prior users are entitled, right? And if they choose to sell it, that\u2019s their prerogative. We\u2019re also making the assumption that new users should not get it, because it is all about money. That I agree with, this airdrop was about money. Anyone who is serious about governing will spend their money on $UNI. If facilitating global transactions and enabling the bankless to overcome with a global currency is the goal of crypto, which I believe it is, there is some responsibility to make sure new users are not left out. Changing the snapshot date I don\u2019t think will accomplish this though, but once token governance is in the communities hands, it can. ",

At that point a contract should be in place to retroactively distribute all UNI tokens remaining for the community to all current uniswap users based on their commitment to the network since the announcement. The specifics of the contract would have to be determined, but I think the above criteria is a good starting place. It takes care of everyone who uses Uniswap since the airdrop notification, as well as both large and small-cap long-time users. The token drop brought a lot of attention to Uniswap, and a lot of potentially new long term users. It was as much publicity and marketing as it was a reward. I 100% think that allocation should be worked in for all users since the airswap notification, and enough time to create a contract that everyone can agree on. ",

I completely agree with your lesson learned, if you mean fairness as in: determining a set of rules and ensuring they apply to every member equally. If you mean fairness as a growing number of people define it; fairness as in not willing to come down hard if things get out of hand for fear of offending someone even if doing so is best for the community, I would have to disagree.

UNI is distributed proportionally based on the amount of contribution to the system. Liquidity providers make the system work, and should get the bulk of UNI proportional to how much they have contributed compounded by the amount of time they have contributed. Users who only used the exchange get a substantially smaller UNI airdrop, but still receive some proportionally based on the amount of fees paid to LPs.    I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. If I hadn\u2019t gotten an airdrop I would\u2019ve bought the token myself when it was around $2-3 dollars. I really don\u2019t care for the kind of \u201ccommunity\u201d actions like this create, but I\u2019d be willing to consider doing something for latecomers with the unclaimed tokens once we reach the date. Seems very premature now, but honestly I\u2019d rather it go to gitcoin grants or something that contributes to the ecosystem. My honest opinion is if you used Uniswap on Aug 31st and got 400 UNI, you got lucky. Besides the LPs, no one really \u201cdeserved\u201d this. Heavy users could consider the UNI they got as a gas rebate. ",

Again with that being said there are a lot of repeat forum posts on how we (The community and actual owners of UNI and not at all connected to management) want rid of these beggars like @cooldove and @Ourodial. Hopefully admins and management will soon layout rules for this forum that will not only stop these posts but stop these people from creating multiple repeated account to post these posts. Also this forum is for talks about Governance not begging for new airdrops which 99% of the people here are using it correctly for compared to the 1% like you guys. In a final point if you care about Uni, Governance and control of the Uniswap protocol by the community for the community and not just getting freebies buy some Uni (pssst it would also entitle you to vote then) @Ourodial and and co and stop being cheap ",

Again I am not an employee, manager or more of Uniswap as I\u2019ve said before I\u2019m just a member of the community like anyone else here the same people who will ultimately vote on what changes happen with the UNI governance token (Not money token) Yes this is a governance board not a begging board (hopefully some clear rules will eventually be rolled out to reflect this) clearly you cannot take a response that disagrees with your views, having discussion is healthy unfortunately clearly you\u2019d rather shut down the conversation that discuss maybe open up and listen to other people who disagree with you and consider their responses instead of being a closed book\u2026 if you look a lot of people are saying the same or similar thing as me, as these are the people who will ultimately decide whether or not another airdrops fate not staff\u2026 might might hurt think before commenting as all in all name calling ultimately wont help towards persuading people with the 1% to make a governance proposal to put forward the proposal in your behalf yet alone have people vote for it. Maybe use this as an opportunity to use and learn persuasive skills to persuade people why people who missed an opportunity laid out by the team for loyal users should consider another drop which in my view wouldnt benefit the current holders or the token other than just the 90% of \u201cit was unfair\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m from a low GDP country so I\u2019m suddenly entitled to this drop because of its value\u201d comments I\u2019ve seen so far on this forum P.s I have had multiple messages from forum admins seeing my messages saying \u201cyes the begging is a problem and we are looking into it\u201d so it\u2019s not only community members like myself that have the same sentiments most people are here for governance as suggested by the gov before the domain ",

The main reason being the snapshot was at least partly set 2 weeks prior to launch to prevent anyone with any insider knowledge of the distribution plan from spinning up a bot and trading with 1000s of addresses. You could also make the snapshot at some other arbitrary time since it\u2019s just about having the knowledge that it could happen to invoke this strategy Retrospectively, if UNI decides to reward old users again from the 1/9/20 to the 1/9/21 maybe people will trade on 100s of addresses just in case.
