The reasons for this change, as described on the call, were the following:  \u201cHard Fork\u201d, while technically accurate, often is perceived by newcomers to Ethereum as to mean \u201cchain split\u201d (and possibly \u201cfree coins\u201d). Most previous HFs/upgrades on Ethereum did  not  result in a chain split, and using \u201cnetwork upgrade\u201d does not bring this connotation to new users, so it should be used as a default, with the possibility of chain splits being explicit The EF has used \u201cnetwork upgrade\u201d over \u201chard fork\u201d for the past couple upgrades, see Istanbul, Constantinople.  On the last ACD call, it seem like there was agreement by core devs on moving this forward, modulo feedback on the specific wording. This is the place for that feedback  Note: this does  not  remove previous instances of the term \u201chard fork\u201d across the EIP repo/all EIPs. Only in the \u201cguidelines\u201d document and for the upcoming upgrade.  I would love to get broader community feedback here on both whether this is a good or bad idea, and the specific phrasing/implementation. Thanks! ",

It\u2019s worth noting that the downsides of \u201chardfork\u201d are mostly around the connotations associated with that word. The benefit of this typically-negative connotation is every infra provider knows they need to update when theres a fork. And, based on the last fork that was during holidays and caught people off guard, this could exacerbate that,. ",

I believe the misunderstanding comes from new currencies from chain splits culturally being called \u201cforks.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if Twitter is the best place to discuss these kind of things. Different threads can be made up, unknown to other stakeholders. It\u2019s a disorganized place to make decisions. For the last few network updates, Muir Glacier and Istanbul, most news articles I read used the term network upgrade. So, the concern over misunderstanding in the future may not be so much an issue as long as the EF addresses them as such. So updating it in the EIP repo may not be necessary. We could optionally include both, one in parenthesis. Or just add a sentence in EIP clarifying hard-fork is a network upgrade, and keep hard fork everywhere else. In terms of the phrase, I like it, but still prefer the term \u201cnetwork update.\u201d There might be a time where a hard-fork may be needed not to bring new features, but to fix something. Fixing something isn\u2019t upgrading it. Like the difficulty bomb hard fork. Nothing was improved, the difficulty bomb was just moved. I understand Zcash uses the term \u201cupgrade,\u201d but I think they were wrong in that for this reason. Regardless, network upgrade is better for beginner understanding than hard-fork. Those that oppose this kind of change, from my read, are not beginners, and deep enough in understanding to not be confused by the term. Then again, a beginner probably won\u2019t be going through the EIP repo. ",
