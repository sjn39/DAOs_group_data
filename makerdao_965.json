                    "content": " 14th April Emergency Executive Hi all, Unhiding the original text following awareness and fixes implemented by other protocols.  The CRVV1ETHSTETH-A oracle was frozen in the April 13th emergency executive at 22:25 UTC to successfully mitigate a potential vulnerability. This proposal was communicated and recommended for voting to delegates to prevent any adverse impact to MakerDAO. Similarly, the Protocol Engineering team has been engaged in ongoing communication with GovAlpha and external parties to manage potential impacts. During the previous week, existing vaults of the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vault-type were not able to withdraw collateral unless they paid off their full debt, users were not at risk of liquidation during this time. In summary; Users could not:  Draw DAI Withdraw collateral unless debt is fully paid back. Get liquidated  Users could:  Add collateral Pay back DAI  As a result, last week\u2019s executive did not include the previously scheduled increases to the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A debt ceiling parameters. Protocol Engineering and GovAlpha will provide a forthcoming update, and post mortem with additional information.  Due to the technical issues referenced above, April 22nd\u2019s Executive will propose to replace and reactivate the Curve stETH/ETH Oracle. This will involve:  Removing permissions on the previous oracle implementation. Adding permissions on the new oracle implementation. Replicating the whitelist for this oracle on the new implementation. This action will restore full functionality to the Curve stETH/ETH oracle and CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vaults.  ",

They might end up combined depending on how much duplication there is. Separately, GovAlpha will also be posting some details and statistics around the response time from delegates on roughly the same timeline as the postmortems.  Apologies to everyone for the less-than-ideal transparency over the last week or so. We\u2019ve tried to be as transparent and open as possible given the circumstances (full details of which should come later.) ",
