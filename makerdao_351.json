Recently Uniswap onboarded the 0.01% fee tier specifically targeted at stablecoin pairs and increasing stablecoin swap traffic to Uniswap. Volume is quickly migrating away from the 0.05% tier to the 0.01% tier for DAI/USDC \u2013 on this pair there is very little slippage for most trades across both of these tiers, so fee amount is what mostly effects the execution price. Over the last 48hrs the 0.01% fee tier has already slipped the volume of the 0.05% tier (even with 20x less liquidity) and over last 24 hrs is earning more in fees (even though fees are 5x less). Long term it seems extremely likely that most stablecoin volume will be on the 0.01% fee tier, so Maker\u2019s leveraged LPing should definitely be moving there in my view. G-UNI DAI/USDC 0.01% tier deployed here Proposed tick range: The 0.01% fee tier has a tick spacing of 1 tick providing maximal flexibility of range selection. So what fixed long term range should we set for the G-UNI Pool? Tick -276324 is roughly the center point with a price of 1.00000264384 DAI = 1 USDC. The trade-off is we want to be as concentrated as possible (to earn maximal fees while in range) while never/infrequently going out of range (to not lose out on fees altogether). My proposal would be a (-276322, -27626) 4 tick range which represents a price spread of 0.9998 - 1.0002 Everything else should remain the same for this new G-UNI pool as with the original 0.05% fee tier pool (no changes to implementation etc.). Onboard G-UNI DAI/USDC 0.01% pool ?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps This poll will end on 2021-11-25T00:00:00Z. If successful, an onboarding poll will be created which will be put on-chain the following Monday. -@LongForWisdom ",

It will be similar to the 5bps pool, but less fees. Volume seems to be much higher though, so perhaps we can get similar TVL.

The fees are reduced by 5x on the new fee tier, but also the concentration is increased by 5x with a 4 tick range. Also, volume should increase as this pool has much more competitive rates and should attract more stablecoin volume to Uniswap.

I\u2019ve made a spreadsheet with some basic calculations, made here:   docs.google.com    Break-Even Calculator G-UNI - 1bps Sheet1  Initial values Initial DAI deposit,10000 Stability fee,0.50% Max multiple,50 Expected total pool size,500000000 Expected average daily fee volume,10000 Gas price in GWei,125 Current ETH price,4150 Swap percentage,50%,This is the estimated...      For a user of this 1 bps pool, through GUNI & Maker with the assumptions in the sheet, it would take quite a high initial deposit amount, to have a relatively quick break-even point of the fixed costs (gas costs for the user). Assuming: 500M total pool size 10k fees per day on average (2x the current amount) Then the non leveraged yearly APR is 0.73%. With a stability fee of 0.5%, the net non leveraged yearly APR is 0.23% With a 50x multiple, the net yearly APR excluding gas costs is 11.50% Including gas costs this means with 10k initial deposit: 963 days till break-even with 100k initial deposit: 96 days.

It seems the major two factors are:  The amount of volume we might expect given a migration of most of the liquidity to the new 1bps tier The size of the stability fee  I am curious about (1) in that I think it is possible we really will see a significant bump in volume there- though this is pure conjecture. Just noting that this highly competitive fee tier may attract new volume to uniswap stablecoin pairs. (2) is not up to me to decide though I suppose it is plausible that the Stability Fee is again lowered at some point in the future to make the margins better? (it just recently lowered from 1% to 0.5%) Given this, and also given that for larger holders or participants opening the position for very long time frames 11.5% APR might still be worthwhile, I still see the benefit in migrating the G-UNI position sooner rather than later. Also note that if the 1bps tier really does take the lion\u2019s share of the volume, then the current GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A on the 5bps fee tier will probably have even worse returns than your projections for 1bps (The 5bps pool could well up with less than 1/5th of the volume of the 1bps pool which would mean less total fees captured by staying put rather than migrating).

Put simply the race to the bottom here with Maker putting large scale fees effectively to 0 is going to squeeze trading liquidity to the margins and fee compression will effectively squeeze out liquidity. The numbers being posited today:     musnit:  11.50% APR is still acceptable for many people. also, your assumption of 500M total pool size is fair, but in practice today even if you assume ALL current TVL in the 5bps pool moves to the 1bps pool, we still only get to ~$300M total pool size which gets us closer to like ~30%-40% APR, which is definitely acceptable for many people. especially if we allow some flexibility in ranges, this could work well (eg; support a tighter-range and wider-range GUNI pool).   are not going to be the same tomorrow. Add another fact.   I read that Gelatio fees are 0% which are due to expire end of 2021. ",

                    "content": "Thanks a lot for the calcs Frank, your sheet is very helpful! Nicely done  However, I would say the assumptions here are debatable. Firstly, I don\u2019t think that having $500M in liquidity for this pool is realistic given the current volume and only assuming a 2x in fees over the long run. At some point we will find an equilibrium, probably around the 200-300M mark where it does not make much sense to add more liquidity because other options for stable lending are more attractive and less gas intensive. By that time, the DAI / USDC pool will consist entirely by G-UNI MakerDAO LPs, all others would have already left the pool. Secondly, 10k initial investment for earning $ on stables on Ethereum is certainly also fairly low these days given current gas prices. For these type of principals, layer 2s like Arbitrum will most likely be more attractive to earn a passive yield. I see where you are coming from, wanting a wider range of smaller users to participate as well, however this I think is probably not possible on Ethereum in the short to medium term, especially since I assume gas prices won\u2019t go down any time soon. If we change these assumptions slightly, e.g. $50k principal and $200M TVL, then you can get to a Net yearly APR excluding gas of 66.25% and 33.44 days to break even (incl proxy), which imo sounds reasonable (this assumes fees will not exceed $10k, which I think they probably will over the next weeks). Also, I think it might be worth discussion lowering the stability fee to somewhere around 0.25% to make this collateral type more attractive. This would offer a net APR of 78.75% with 28 days to break even. ",

Figure out what the remaining APY would be for the user on that pool, considering this pricing + some expected fee volumes, without using a multiple of that APY using Maker. Figure out what multiple + what max TVL makes sense for that APY. Figure out what the estimated break-even point would be for users of that pool, based on minimum vault debt criteria. If all of the above make sense for Maker & Vault users, then onboard this collateral with those parameters, AND off-board the 0,05% fee pool at the same time.  ",
