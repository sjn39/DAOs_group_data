                    "content": "Hello Uniswap Community! I\u2019d like to propose a change that enables lower trading fees for UNI holders. Tier 1: Holders of 1k-5k UNI pay a 25bps fee on trades on Uniswap. Tier 2: Holders of 5k-25k UNI pay a 20bps fee. Tier 3: Holders of 25k+ UNI pay a 15bps fee. Of course there can be more tiers (if we wanted to be fancy\u2026 we could even design a curve [Amt_UNI vs Fee_Bps]). Lmk if any folks are interested in discussing this. I believe it makes sense for those who hold the core asset of the protocol (UNI) to have discounted trading fees\u2026 this make UNI holders feel a little more at home when trading on the Uniswap Protocol. Thanks, Cliff.eth ",
