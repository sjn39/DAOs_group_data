                    "content": "As we are completing our first year of Core Unit, we are presenting in this document our achievements, in line with our mandate, and objectives for the coming year. We are also detailing our spending plan in comparison with last year. Our mandate remains the same: \u201cincrease the supply and demand of Dai globally, through available and new distribution channels by intelligently deploying the human and financial capital given by the DAO.\u201d Given the market dynamics and the fast-moving environment, we are continuously adapting our strategy, ecosystem, and priorities.  Objectives and main accomplishments, 05/21-03/22 After one year as a CU, we have been concentrating our efforts on expanding Maker\u2019s ecosystem to increase the number of Dai in circulation globally. Our key priorities were:  Increase DAI supply by:   Communicating and educating users (i.e.institutions, whales, retail) about Maker as a lending protocol Supporting the democratization and the spread of the lending service with strategic partners Supporting new collaterals onboarding in the protocol by collaborating with PECU, CES, Oracles, and Risk Stimulating the usage of the vaults   Increase DAI demand by:   Communicating and educating users on the use cases of Dai Providing easy access to Dai on the most relevant platforms via strategic partnerships Stimulating the usage of Dai  Throughout the period of 05/21-03/22, we closed 141 integrations with partners across various verticals and regions. Below is the breakdown by vertical and Tier type.  1174\u00d7864 74.4 KB  To increase DAI supply, we focused on four verticals: DeFi/CeFi: we support the onboarding of new collaterals in the protocol by collaborating with PECU, CES, Oracles, and Risk. And we work with relevant aggregators to build a User Interface for the ilk. Once the product is finalized (i.e., an ilk with a UI and sometimes strategies on the back), we lead the public announcements on different media channels.  This year, we helped onboard: stETH, MATIC, PSM-GUSD, and PSM-USDP, generating more than 673M DAI and about 3.8M DAI in annual fees.  @Jenn led the work with Fireblocks to whitelist DAI and the D3M, so any institution in need of a third party authorizing its usage can do it through Fireblocks. And she\u2019s also helping other protocols integrate the D3M (Compound, MapleFinance, TrueFi, and Aave Arc). Institutional Vaults: Although we are still in the process of releasing the IV product, it has helped us to initiate conversations with companies with large crypto treasuries and introduce them to Maker. They are easily distracted by rewards other protocols offer and are not paying that much attention to Maker\u2019s attractive services (e.g. lowest stability fees).  Thanks to IV and the one-to-one conversations we have had with these companies, we helped to generate more than 1.2B DAI and about 29M DAI in annual fees.  Currently, we are working with six companies to offer them an Institutional Vault. This process takes time as we have to educate their legal and compliance team about Maker and define the agreement for the vaults (as these vaults will be minting a minimum of 200m DAI). With @joce_chang leading the process, one of these companies recently posted its proposal in the forum. RWA: We have been supporting the RWF team in getting new leads and supporting the onboarding process. Due to complications and unexpected events (e.g. late integration and change of RWF team), we have not yet been able to finalize the onboarding of any RWA collateral. During the year, we supported relationship management with teams at SG-Forge and Centrifuge. @Hajive  partnered with Centrifuge to bring Mastercard to DeFi! The Mastercard transaction tapping the maker vault happened on May 9th. PR and comms will initially come from ConsolFreight / Centrifuge, and over the next few days, we will update the broader community with our PR agencies. PreMIP\u2019s support has been engaged with companies like Monetalis and OPM. Between them, they have four proposals in the governance poll voting and we have also supported others, such as Kredika, in submitting proposals to the DAO, with several more in the pipeline to come. For DAI demand, we focused on the following verticals: DeFi/CeFi: We provide easy access to Dai and Maker in the most relevant platforms and create use cases around DAI. We have posted the Marketing Activations documents at the end of every quarter, highlighting our achievements during the period. Some of the more relevant integrations during the year are:  Dai support on Bitpay (Bitpay is a top crypto payment processor for merchants and retail customers, 1M+ users) Dai support on BlockFi (BlockFi is a leading retail and institutional trading, lending, borrowing, and staking venue, with 1M+ users) Kraken MKR list (Kraken is a leading centralized exchange in the US) DAI expansion in the Japanese market by ensuring DAI listing on Japanese exchanges where DAI was the first stablecoin to be whitelisted by the Japanese regulator Argent launched their layer zkSync wallet with DAI support in Q1 and, as a result, drove a layer2 yield DAI offering on GroProtocol and a native DAI zkSync onramp via Ramp. This lays the ground nicely to grow the partnership as their new ArgentX offering is set to dominate the StarkNet ecosystem and ensure DAI is competitively positioned in that ecosystem. DAI support on Mercado Bitcoin, the biggest exchange in Latam with more than 2M users. DAI support on LemonCash, one of Latam\u2019s most recognized exchanges. Anchorage Digital Vote Delegation integration  Gaming&NFTs: Due to the growth of games and NFTs and their reach to new audiences, we have focused on this sector by integrating DAI into games and sponsoring tournaments with DAI prizes. @Lozadaluis12 led the gaming initiative, and thanks to him, we hosted over 15 gaming tournaments reaching over 1M users. We made drops of fantastic NFT branded items through partners like Battle Racers, and pushed hard on tournaments, mostly for Axie Infinity. This exposure allowed us to have Reven (one of the biggest Spanish gamers and influencers) talking about Dai and helped us present Dai to a new audience as a currency for prizes and teach them that 1 Dai = 1 USD. All these integrations are possible thanks to the teamwork inside Growth, where BDs have a support team that helps them with:   Technical support: @zxMori empowers the BD team with documentation and support explaining Maker Protocol mechanics during meetings with potential technical integrations and vault clients. He has worked on documents to explain the PSM, the Maker Teleport (wormhole), and IVs.   Crypto updates and research: Every week, @Facundo sends us a \u201cDeFi weekly for Maker newsletter\u201d for internal use to keep BDs informed with the main news of the crypto ecosystem, including topics such as DeFi, the main DAOs, other stablecoins, layer 2 in general and regulation. Facu and Felipe are also maintaining a spreadsheet with an overview of the four major L2s projects (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync n Starnet/Ex) with information that helps us define a strategy for those.   Communication and stakeholder education: We have interacted with the ecosystem (i.e., partners) during our meetings or conferences and have used the MakerGrowth Twitter account. We improved our comms strategy by managing the Maker Twitter account this year. With @tobalgarcia  leading the content strategy, in two months, we reached the same level of impressions we had during the period of regular activity in this account, exceeding one million impressions in April. Here is a summary of the Twitter metrics for both accounts.    Events: We also helped organize all the Maker events, with @Corina supporting other teams in the organization of EthCC meetup. Lisbon meetup, Daivinty, and the Lemon Maker in Rio. These events brought the community and our partners together in real life, helping with networking and brainstorming.  Details on all of Growth\u2019s accomplishments can be found in our updates on the forum or by following MakerGrowth\u2019s Twitter account.  Financial Review March 2021 to June 2022 This review considers actuals from May 2021 to April 2022 and forecasts for May and June 2022. Growth\u2019s 13 months approved budget of 3.5M DAI was a fair estimation that allowed us to build the team, close 141 integrations with partners, and start incubating the Brand team.  1256\u00d7342 80.9 KB   1526\u00d7782 118 KB    Personnel Expenses: The team passed from 7.7 FTE to 9.75 FTE. These additional headcounts support the BD team with technical knowledge and communications.   Partner Expenses: The remaining funds are because we decided to be more strategic with the Marketing Activations and propose these actions only to T1 and T2 partners. When working with these tiers of partners, agreements and execution take longer. We also retained the payment of partners who didn\u2019t fulfill their commitments, and that\u2019s why we returned the provisioned funds for these initiatives in January.   Sponsorships: We didn\u2019t consider sponsorships in our previous budget because it wasn\u2019t directly part of our mandate. But without a CU in charge of it, we saw the need to sponsor events/media outlets to get speaker slots and use it as a platform to present Maker and be closer to potential partners.   Travel Expenses: Our budget covered the team\u2019s travel expenses and helped us understand the costs per FTE for the next cycle budget.   Admin Expenses: This budget included costs associated with the providers\u2019 payment in fiat. As part of our mandate, we always try to pay most of our providers in DAI without incurring banking and exchange fees.   Buffer: We came in under budget as we didn\u2019t plan to grow that fast in the number of agreements with providers. The buffer budget is to cover any eventuality, and it\u2019s calculated as a percentage of the amount of the current contracts.    Focus July 2022 to June 2023. For this year, our mandate remains the same, but we established a different strategy to suit Maker\u2019s needs and the current situation of the ecosystem. Our growth plan for this year will be based on the following three key priorities: 1. Brand recognition: We decided to incubate the Brand Team due to the necessity of having a dedicated team working on the MakerDAO branding and announcements. During the first year of the GrowthCU, we relied on our partners to announce new integrations and create brand awareness for MakerDAO among their audience. However, we are convinced that this is not sustainable and that Maker has to manage its branding to amplify and generate a long-lasting and coherent impact. 2. Increase DAI supply:   Multichain partnerships: Once we start deploying Maker Vaults in various domains, we will work to develop that ecosystem and generate integrations with Maker. At the same time, we will focus on integrating the Maker Wormhole in various bridges and aggregators.   Partners as collateral: Following the same strategy as last year, we want to propose valuable collateral to the protocol, and the multichain vision will open numerous opportunities for that.   Partners opening vaults: We will continue pushing Institutional Vaults to bring closer Institutions to Maker.    1600\u00d7678 140 KB  3. Increase DAI demand:  Multichain DAI: Providing easy access to MultichainCanonical-DAI on the most relevant platforms CeFi, DeFi: Creating use cases around the Multichain-Maker and incentivizing the re-establishment of Maker as a critical piece in the Money Legos. Dai users: Stimulate the usage of DAI.   1600\u00d7704 149 KB  ",
