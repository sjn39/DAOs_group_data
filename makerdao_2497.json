Whether you hold Maker (MKR) or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in MakerDAO governance, this is your one-stop-shop for updates on the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Governance Governance and Risk had their 100th Episode Thursday! This positive note was worth sharing: \u201cI thought I\u2019d mention that this is such an amazing project, we\u2019re at the 100th governance call, and we\u2019re discussing a coveted good problem to have, which is that there\u2019s a ton of demand for Dai. Not just from COMP, but from all over the market. And most startups, most companies, would die (Dai) to be in this position, no pun intended. Or maybe pun intended. I just wanted to call out and I know that we have hard decisions to make, and it\u2019s going to be difficult to figure out how we scale, but this is the right set of circumstances that we want to grow this project. It\u2019s exciting to be here. It\u2019s exciting to be with you guys.\u201d @cmooney  Executive  No current Executive Vote   Polls   Vault Compensation Plan - Approval of this poll moves forward with the other votes laid out in the plan.
