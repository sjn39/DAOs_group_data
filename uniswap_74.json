Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**\nWe need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. \n\n## Solution\n\nPartial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.\n\nTVL Metric is only an example.

Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)\n\n# KPI Options\n\n## How do KPI Options work?\n\nKPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. \n\n1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. \n2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.\n3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. \n4. For our example above:\n    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b\n    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. \n    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.\n    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. \n\n## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?\n\nFrom example above, KPI Option is created by:\n\n1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token \n2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b\n3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  \n\nUNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. \n\n1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). \n2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. \n3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. \n4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!\n5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!\n6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!\n\nWin - Win - Win\n\n# Additional Details\n\n[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon.

While TVL is a good metric to compare different protocols, Uni v3 is focused more on capital efficiency, which we can see via their implementation of concentrated liquidity, rather than TVL. TVL is highly dependent on token price, which is subject to extreme volatility, and does not directly incentivize more trading on Uni. The whole purpose of KPI options is to incentivize behavior aligned with the protocol. Therefore, a better KPI could be average market share over some predefined period of time rather than TVL. The goal is to establish Uniswap as the dominant leader in DEXs, which we believe connects better with average market share rather than TVL. More clarification on implementation details would be extremely helpful in evaluating this proposal in-depth. Additionally, could you explain how you will avoid conflicts of interest given you are carrying out treasury management for SushiSwap, a direct competitor to Uniswap. Also, there has been a $100k grant given to a group to explore treasury management options for Uniswap\u2019s treasury, do you have any plans to work with them? ",

I was thinking the next phase after temperature check was that we could explore the different possible KPIs that would create a better win-win situation. For sushiHOUSE we\u2019ve transferred control of the set to sushi and are no longer directly actively managing their treasury. They wanted to take control of it, which is an option of what we do. I do not see any conflicts of interest here. We want to help all DAOs protect their treasuries. Yes, I\u2019ve spoken with the group that received the grant. We both have the same goals but maybe a different route. KPI options in my opinion allow for a much better win-win situations vs other divestment options. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.
