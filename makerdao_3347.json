It is becoming more and more worrisome that we have to rely on one human to have Executives/Polls pass/voted on\u2013that one human is known as KhanMaker. And as much as I am thankful for Khan, I am sad that the Community cannot make things happen. We have so many good people here willing and ready to participate\u2013day in, day out, for the benefit of the DAO. What can be done temporarily while we wait for Vote Delegation? At this point I\u2019m ready to provide my personal credentials, KYC/AML and ask other Whales to delegate to me. And YOU should as well. Unconventional, I know\u2013but I have nothing hide, and the only think I want is for the success of this DAO to come into fruition, and help DeFi completely change the spectrum of traditional finance. \u201cGovernance can also be extremely time and energy consuming\u201d. And perhaps as @Planet_X had mention on a previous post, perhaps we should consider Governance Minimization. Or, perhaps not. If the argument for on-chain governance is that\u2013\u201cit can allow protocols to evolve faster\u201d community die-hards like @Aaron_Bartsch and @ultraschuppi have to time and time again ask for voter participation the old fashion way\u2013by pleading. Therefore, such argument is proving to be untrue.  If the intention here is to prove that on-chain governance causes faster protocol evolution, have we really succeeded? And finally\u2013I\u2019ll leave you with some thoughts made by Fred Ehrsam: image818\u00d7294 14 KB ",
