As you\u2019re a former CU contributor, I\u2019m sure that isn\u2019t your intention so I\u2019m reluctant to remove the post. Perhaps you could elaborate more about Flux and its relevance to Maker and DAI? Currently, this is just a press release from an unrelated protocol. Edit: Thanks for editing the OP! ",
