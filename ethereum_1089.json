Differentiating between sending Tx to a new account vs an existing account.  I want to outline my arguments for the 1st approach, which I believe delivers 90% of the value to the Ethereum community, can be achieved much quicker, carry very little risk, complexity or debt, and is incremental in nature. However, I don\u2019t want to \u201chog\u201d your EIP on this, which feels to me leaning towards the 2nd approach. Should I fork this with my own take  or should I add another EIP? ",

Although I don\u2019t think there is any need worrying about this until after you complete your outline, I feel strongly that 1 should not be done unless 2 is also done. Please add yourself as an author to the EIP so you can automerge changes in the future. Thanks. ",
