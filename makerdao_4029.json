Introduction. This paper assesses the potential structures for the Maker protocol\u2019s adoption of real world assets. As the Maker protocol is not a legal entity itself, this paper contemplates both the creation of a legal entity engaged with the Maker protocol (the \u201cGovernance Avatar\u201d) and a legal entity to be engaged with the real world asset (the \u201cRWA Entity\u201d). The Governance Avatar and the RWA Entity are assessed against the following criteria:   An orphaned special purpose entity that is bankruptcy remote.   Locus of decision-making (Maker protocol or delegated to a third party (trustee, service provider, authorized person)).   Nature of fiduciary duties to the extent of delegated decision-making to a third party.   Separation between the Maker protocol and the real world asset.   Simplicity.   This paper assesses the following hypothetical Governance Avatars and RWA Entities: Governance Avatars -  a Cayman company owned by a Cayman charitable trust, and a Cayman foundation company without members.  RWA Entities -  a Delaware statutory trust, and a single, member-managed Delaware limited liability company owned and managed by the Governance Avatar.  There are other potential jurisdictions and legal entities that could be adopted for the Governance Avatar and the RWA Entity. The appropriateness of the potential jurisdiction and legal entity type may be influenced by:   The physical location of the real world asset (United States, Europe, Singapore, etc).   The type of real world asset (treasuries, corporate bonds, ETFs, loan portfolios and within loan portfolios, the type of asset - trade receivables, real estate, renewable energy, distressed debt, agriculture, etc).   Analysis  image1920\u00d71308 221 KB   image2177\u00d71446 449 KB   image2177\u00d7733 131 KB  The options above are neither exhaustive nor exclusive. It is entirely possible to mix and match Governance Avatars with different RWA Entities. Further, depending on the jurisdiction of the real world asset (United States, EU, Singapore, etc.), the type of real world asset, and the acceptability of one option over the other in a relevant market, one option (or combination) may be more attractive than the other. For clarity, this paper does not address the tax consequences of the above structures. Further, this paper does not address how the Maker protocol interacts with the Governance Avatar in terms of funding and the accounting treatment of such funding. Finally, this paper does not address each of the contracts likely to be needed to ensure that there is not any leakage of DAI or fiat currency from the overall structure (i.e., escrow accounts, payment instructions, etc.).

                    "content": "This excellent work by @christiancdpetersen shows us how complex those legal structures are. They are complex as they are quite flexible and the name could be misleading. For instance, in the chat @PaperImperium rightfully asked if the Foundation directors have a fiduciary duty (they have). But no one did ask if the Trustees of a Delaware Statutory Trust have a fiduciary duty. It seems obvious. Well \u2026 For sake of precision, the Delaware LLC presented here is specific in its purpose. Other kinds of construct can be made with a Delaware LLC, it\u2019s just a flexible structure. You can read here to see that the difference between a Delaware Statutory Trust and a Delaware LLC is thinner than what you might think. While the discussion in the community was mainly on the structure names, we are in the view that a discussion is much needed regarding the \u201cLocus of decision-making\u201d. What should MakerDAO keep as control and what it should delegate (and to who?). While it seems simple as \u201clet\u2019s give the baby to a reputable trustee with a fiduciary duty and all should be fine, it will decrease governance burden and remove us from the heat from a regulatory PoV\u201d, well \u2026 this doesn\u2019t seem like the world we live in. A deal like SolarX will require some decision-making (like is the milestone achieved, is it defaulting?, \u2026). If MakerDAO keeps/makes the decision, this could put us in light for the regulator. Or we can trust a service provider or some community members. Or we could say we don\u2019t want to invest where we need to make a decision. The latter would limit us to financial products (like bonds). Easier to manage, less risky from a regulatory point of view but is it \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d? Isn\u2019t it missing the best opportunity to show the world that DeFi is creating a better world and not just farming the financial markets for yield (some might this would be like TradFi)? Isn\u2019t public support and societal good the best tools to influence a possible future regulation? As the RWF facilitator, I don\u2019t really have a view. But I think MakerDAO should have one. We can explore and experiment, but at some point, we will have to decide (speaking about the previous questions, for the legal structure we can have many types, and having many structure jurisdictions is better).

Here are some observations/questions, if I may.   Bigger decisions matter more to MakerDao:  the larger the value involved, the more important the decision, particularly if there is a wider range of expected outcomes.  Meaning a big decision is one that is economically sizable and isnt trivial (one choice clearly dominates).   Thus bigger decisions require more attention/focus than smaller ones.  Perhaps create value metrics to determine where the decision is made at:  servicer, subgroup at MakerDao, MakerDao Governance?   As MakerDao scales up, its portfolio of assets will significantly increase, requiring many more decisions.  Thus a decision process needs to scale, which means creating a process that can (eventually) make many decisions competently and efficiently.   In my experience servicers generally can make small decisions reasonably well but larger decisions can be more problematic as their interests are not always well aligned with the economic owners and they do not like/get paid for legal liability around bigger decisions.

We learned today that the fiduciary duty of the Cayman Foundation directors is stronger than expected and that there is no escape. Even if the constitution says they should listen to a committee or a DAO Resolution, they are responsible for the decision. This is a strong incentive to avoid issues and bad decisions. At the same time, they will not be confident having to act on anyone\u2019s input but would be more confident working with professionals. Usually, they are managing funds so there is a professional investment manager to tell them what to do. They are happy to comply as listening to a professional seems the right things to do. I wonder as well if we shouldn\u2019t just push most decisions to the servicer who is probably more knowledgeable in the space (and we can get a specific servicer per collateral, being an expert in the field). For the most important decisions (still TBD), the servicer will revert to the director (or the trustee) that will probably revert to the DAO (or the Trust Sponsor which might as well, hopefully, revert to the DAO) if it\u2019s not obvious. The servicer could still be at some point a Core Unit (and, in any case, could be changed from time to time by MakerDAO whish), but they should be professionals. Is there a reason we want it otherwise? ",

As such, the director will have a duty to the shareholders/members (owners of the company) too. In the case of the Foundation Company, we have structured the Foundation Company so that it is a pure orphaned entity - i.e., it does not have any members/shareholders. For certain pre-agreed matters, the organizational documents of the Foundation Company will require the director to follow the directions of Maker if the Maker community votes in favor of that certain action. So, in this respect, the director will follow the instructions set forth in a DAO Resolution. Of course, there may be scenarios (very unlikely) where the Maker community votes in favor of a certain matter that the director cannot perform. The most obvious, for example, is if the Maker community votes on a matter that requires the director to breach Cayman law. I suspect that the director will not carry out the will of the Maker community and will instead resign. There is a spectrum between centralization (taking direction from the Maker community as if Maker was a shareholder) and decentralization (where Maker has zero influence in the Foundation Company). From my perspective, as a lawyer, I am seeking to identify where the Maker community is comfortable along that spectrum. I think the points raised by @Eumenes and @Vishal_Mehta above indicate different points along that spectrum. And I think your question is another point along the spectrum. ",

Lets consider an asset backed deal with many small sized assets so that the performance of any given asset will not drive overall performance.  I am making assumptions below to give more structure to this example.  I hope it is helpful. DECISION MAKING ROLES   Servicer:  Asset Decisions (non Material Decisions?) Typically the asset originator will not only originate the assets but also service them as well which makes sense for alignment of interests, though sometimes the securitization assets may be serviced by unrelated third party servicers.  Regardless the servicer will be an expert in managing the specific asset type.  The servicer will follow Servicing Policy which are required by the securitization.  These policies/procedures mandate how the servicer makes decisions for each specific asset. Given that (a) each asset is relatively small (non-Material), (b) the servicer is an expert is managing the assets, (c) the Servicing Policy has been reviewed/approved by investors for the securitization and (d) there any many many assets to be managed, it makes sense that the servicer make decisions at the asset level.  Note at the asset level the economic value of each asset decision is small (non Material) and many asset decisions need to be made.   Director:  Material Decisions The Director(s) are appointed to oversee and manage the Servicers.  I think the Directors make Material Decisions (ones that potentially impact many assets - which may meaningfully impact the trust).  Material Decisions would typically include items such as approving changes to the Servicing Policy, approving amendments, approving actions to manage a securitization in distress (covenant violations, events of default\u2026).  Many of these actions may be proposed by the Servicer but need review and approval by the Director(s).   Maker:  Strategic Decisions The Maker should make Strategic Decisions which I think are meant to address large economic value issues primarily.  Perhaps an economic threshold needs to be set.  Material Decisions for a very large transaction could meet this threshold but I would typically expect Strategic Decisions to be ones that impact the portfolio across multiple deals.  For example an important Servicing Policy change that would impact multiple deals in the same portfolio would likely qualify.  I also suggest that many portfolio liability decisions may be Strategic as thee likely impact a large part of the liabilities and thus could have large economic impact.   A few notes: A large corporate loan would likely need more involvement by the Director(s) as it is one lumpy Material Exposure, unlike the ABS example above. How should the Trust Sponsor role fit here? What framework addressed Maker liability decisions?  Many of these could have significant economic impact and thus be Strategic Decisions. ",

I think only the secretary should be Cayman residents. But as you assume, it makes sense to have one expert in Cayman law and located in Cayman Islands. We haven\u2019t thought otherwise at least. It could also make sense if we fall under the economic substance rule (we don\u2019t in the current setup but who knows what is the future).     flipflopflapdelegate:  Also, with regards to non-fiduciary duties of skill, is a Director obliged to exhibit blockchain technology skills, knowledge, and/or experience?   No, but those with whom we are discussing are. They should be comfortable understanding how a blockchain and a DAO work. We are not the only ones in crypto with a Cayman Foundation. Like some are directors for hedge funds. They don\u2019t make the investment decision, they are given an investment manager (or a committee) and they follow what they say. As long as those people are professionals, the director doesn\u2019t have a problem following them. At the SPV level, it makes sense to delegate to experts in the specific collateral. ",
