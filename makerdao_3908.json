                    "content": " MIP57: RWA Committee  Preamble MIP#: 57 Title: RWA Committee Author(s): Gregory Di Prisco (@g_dip) Contributors: @mrabino1, @williamr, @Viktor_Viktorov1, @ElProgreso Type: General Status: Withdrawn Date Proposed: 2021-07-09 Date Ratified: n/a Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip57-rwa-committee/9304   Sentence Summary MIP57 formalizes the creation of the Real-World Asset [RWA] Committee, its scope, and a process by which MKR holders can modify its membership and internal procedures.  Paragraph Summary This MIP formalizes the creation of the Real-World Assets [RWA] Committee, its scope, and a process by which MKR holders can modify its membership. This committee was spawned out of the Parameter Proposal Group created by SebVentures. This committee presents a new scope which better accounts for the qualifications and conflicts of its membership and addresses the need for strategic research and guidance by the DAO in regards to Real-World Assets.  Component Summary MIP57: RWA Committee This MIP outlines the scope and purpose of the RWA Committee. MIP57c1: Member List This component defines the membership of the RWA Committee. MIP57c2: RWA Committee Quorum This component defines the quorum needed for the outcome of votes to be considered valid. MIP57c3: RWA Committee Pass Threshold This component defines the percentage of votes that the committee must have to consider a vote passed (e.g. simple majority).  Motivation Most of the discourse around Real-World Assets in the Maker Protocol has revolved around structural, procedural and geopolitical implications rather than a risk analysis of the assets/asset originators. The scope of this committee is to separate these \u201chigh level\u201d issues from the specific deal analysis and to provide blanket guidance that applies to all Real-World Assets in the protocol. This committee will not have any explicit power in the governance process, contrary to most Core Units, but will be limited to making recommendations that may be \u201capproved\u201d by MKR holders via on-chain polls.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP57: RWA Committee The RWA committee will consist of individual members that are ratified by the MKR holders and each member may cast one vote when internally processing recommendations. Any member may bring a vote to the floor of the committee. A quorum of 66.1% or more of the membership must be present in a committee meeting in order for the outcome of a vote to be considered valid and a pass threshold of 50.1% will be required for a vote to be considered passed. A stalemate will proceed to an on-chain poll in the following monthly cycle and have the normal rules of a poll applied to it. The committee will meet, at a minimum, once per month and will coordinate this timing internally. The committee will limit its scope to making recommendations to the MKR holders in the following areas:   Structural requirements for Real-World Assets in MakerDAO. E.g., recommending the use of an independent administrator/director in an SPV   Geopolitical implications of Real-World Assets in MakerDAO. E.g., recommending maximum jurisdictional exposure and jurisdiction-specific policies   Business strategy of Real-World Assets in MakerDAO. E.g., recommending a global minimum stability fee on RWA in order to provide a buffer for an increasing DSR    MIP57c1: MIP57 Committee Member List This subproposal lists the individuals permitted to vote as part of the RWA Committee and can be amended by modifying the Member List through this MIP. The original Member List will consist of:  @Planet_X @flipflopflapdelegate @prose11  @mrabino1, significant RWA beneficiary with 6S Capital  @Akiva, owner of a project on hedge interest rate in DeFi  @g_dip, has a business to bring RWA to MakerDAO  @_LS, working at Centrifuge @Cmo @omahalawyer  @roollie, work for NAOS, has a current MIP6 application, as an asset manager, with PandaCredit and Centrifuge, and is looking forward to future applications. @Allan_Pedersen @DavidJeng  @Viktor_Viktorov1, involved in a current MIP6 @PaperImperium  MIP57c1 subproposals have the following parameters:  Feedback Period: 2 weeks Frozen Period: 2 weeks  MIP57c1 subproposals must use the template located at this link. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.  MIP57c2: RWA Committee Quorum This subproposal can amend the quorum needed for the outcome of votes to be considered valid. The original quorum will be:  66.1%  MIP57c2 subproposals have the following parameters:  Feedback Period: 2 weeks Frozen Period: 2 weeks  MIP57c2 subproposals must use the template located at this link. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status.  MIP57c3: RWA Committee Pass Threshold This subproposal can amend the percentage of votes that the committee must have to consider a vote passed (e.g. simple majority). The original threshold will be:  50.1%  MIP57c3 subproposals have the following parameters:  Feedback Period: 2 weeks Frozen Period: 2 weeks  MIP57c3 subproposals must use the template located at this link. This template is considered ratified once this MIP moves to Accepted status. ",

Those recommendations can be passed as Signal Request anyway. For instance, I always said that 2% is the minimum SF we should have for medium/long-term RWA. Nevertheless, we might want to think otherwise by investing in T-Bonds. We are also working with a prospect with a very low SF, but what we think MakerDAO might recognize of strategic importance. For structural requirements, we mentioned having an independent director since January. Another simple piece of advice is to avoid investing in any RWA where the cost of the structure is higher than the expected return. Structural is mostly legal and I fail to see how a committee can be a better help than a law firm review. The same applies to geopolitical implications (which probably need a Geopolitical CU? Who knows). While a PPG is there to process facts and unknowns to make a decision (on things to propose as to reduce Governance bandwidth), I fail to see the value of this committee, especially without resources (and it would be a CU otherwise).

I think this is a good idea as long as we can all agree to keep the membership static for that timeframe? I would note that by the time this is actually voted on, given the length of the governance cycle, the committee will have been operating for over a month - so this might be a moot point.     SebVentures:  For instance, I always said that 2% is the minimum SF we should have for medium/long-term RWA   Fully agree with this btw, and I think it\u2019s a good example of the kind of recommendation this committee can work through governance.     SebVentures:  Structural is mostly legal and I fail to see how a committee can be a better help than a law firm review. The same applies to geopolitical implications (which probably need a Geopolitical CU? Who knows).   I think the key here is that the feedback is supposed to be very high level and probably out of the scope of what a lawyer would do. Independence and cost are two important concepts that didn\u2019t require a lawyer, and if more concepts like this come up this committee can be here to address them. One I can think of off the top of my head is operational security - i.e. ensuring that best practices are maintained and Dai is not lost in transit. I think the MKR holders would appreciate specific guidance on how to implement that and this committee could provide it.     SebVentures:  While a PPG is there to process facts and unknowns to make a decision (on things to propose as to reduce Governance bandwidth), I fail to see the value of this committee, especially without resources (and it would be a CU otherwise).   From my perspective, a Core Unit is \u201cspecial\u201d because of the ability of its facilitator to expedite the governance process outside of filing a stand-alone MIP. For instance, you as the Facilitator of the RWF Core Unit are able to have direct input into executive spells (or at least direct input into the process that a non-facilitator does not). If a group doesn\u2019t need that, I don\u2019t think they should be a Core Unit, hence why I kept this at a lower level. I think the description of the committee pretty clearly outlines its value, not to mention that the impetus for creating it is coming out of previous lapses in the onboarding process. I\u2019d also add that the idea to convert the PPG into a committee isn\u2019t exclusively my idea and was born in the RWF Committee call we had last week, so I would welcome the others with me on that call to help articulate its value proposition. The one thing I am a bit surprised about is that I put this draft up in the #rwf-committee channel on rocketchat last Wednesday and you were the first person to provide feedback. Did you not feel like that channel was sufficient for providing the \u201cfail to see the value\u201d feedback that you\u2019ve provided here? It\u2019s not a big deal, but I would have liked the opportunity to see if anyone else felt that way and to preemptively incorporate the contents of this post into the MIP. ",

The beauty of PPGs is, that we can have multiple of them caring about overlapping parameters. I don\u2019t think a MIP should be bound to a list of people (even if it is just an initial set), it should be generic in a way multiple committees could appear (see PPGs) Actually I think all topics covered here should be in the responsibility for the RWF-CUs anyway - no need to form another group. Right now this commitee looks more like a group to control the RWF-CUs - I don\u2019t think this is helpful.  Please convince me I am wrong on those points  ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the questions @ultraschuppi , I think you\u2019ve identified some clarifications that I can edit into the MIP.     ultraschuppi:  If the mandate/task described in the MIP is not already part of the CUs associated (remember, we can easily have multiple RWF Coreunits) - why should we centralize it to one specific group of people? The beauty of PPGs  is, that we can have multiple of them caring about overlapping parameters.   There\u2019s no centralization at all! There can be 10 RWA Committees if people would like to start them. I\u2019ll also add that this committee is a step removed from a PPG because it will not be recommending any parameters (someone should probably start a RWF PPG to fill the gap).     ultraschuppi:  I don\u2019t think a MIP should be bound to a list of people (even if it is just an initial set), it should be generic in a way multiple committees could appear (see PPGs)   The MIP isn\u2019t \u201cbound\u201d to the list of people (which has just been copied/pasted from the original PPG list), as governance can modify the list at any time. Once again there can be many RWA Committees if governance desires.     ultraschuppi:  Actually I think all topics covered here should be in the responsibility for the RWF-CUs anyway - no need to form another group.   This is where I think we\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree. But I do want to take this opportunity to clarify the guidance process in case that\u2019s where the disagreement lies. Right now the RWF CU makes decisions within their mandate and applies those as a binary outcome via an onboarding vote (or at least this is how it\u2019s worked in practice). The process this group will follow is to separate conceptual issues from specific applications and provide guidance to MKR holders and CUs. To process this guidance, we submit votes to the MKR holders to ratify them. For instance, if we should say \u201cAll real world assets should have an independent director,\u201d this would go to an on-chain vote and MKR holders could accept or reject it. The RWF CUs can do this as well, but  as you mentioned above there\u2019s nothing wrong with redundancy.     ultraschuppi:  Right now this commitee looks more like a group to control the RWF-CUs - I don\u2019t think this is helpful.   This could not be further from the truth. My points to refute this are as follows:  This committee can\u2019t control anything, it is quite literally limited to providing soft guidance that can then must be accepted or rejected by the MKR holders. Even if the committee puts out guidance, the RWF CUs are free to ignore it. The current RWF team was invited to have representation on the committee and chose to not participate so that the committee could have greater autonomy, but they can always join via MIP57c1 at any time. There is no limit on the number of committees that can form to provide guidance and, if they wanted to for whatever reason, MKR holders can shut this one down at any time by removing all names from the member list  To summarize, this group will not be commenting on specific RWA applications and will keep its guidance to high level issues that impact all RWA in MakerDAO. There\u2019s a history of these issues being overlooked and therefore I believe that a group like this will be beneficial to the DAO. It has no autonomy to enforce its guidance and will be submitting every item on which it provides guidance to be ratified by MKR holders (either as a bundle or individually, depending on input from the governance facilitators in how they think this should work). This is not an exclusive group, anyone can join via subproposal or create a separate committee. ",

It feels a bit like a \u201cSoftware Engineering Standards Committee\u201d that tells @Protocol-Engineering that they need to care more about cohesion (just making up a random example) - but in the end the CU just does not care and continues delivering what they deliver. And then imagine this guidance being voted on onchain  ",

But I reckon I would have to, given maybe some misconception (or my misunderstanding, whichever is true). Recently, I asked the question of whether the existing PPG group was open for memberships. It was a simple Y/N question. There are reasons related to efficiency etc that may warrant not opening new memberships, which I totally understand and actually even agree to a large extent. But from a governance stand point, I do not think the current set up of groups that have a significant impact on the protocol have necessarily an \u201copen door policy\u201d. I would rather say, let\u2019s not fool ourselves here and give ourselves a tap in the back saying we\u2019re doing great in that regard. So, maybe voting is not such a bad thing. I would advocate for credentials as well for some specific groups, such as risk parameter policies groups. Do people have a background in risk management (skill AND experience) and so on to be there in the first place (I do for once). But I understand the idea of credentials is not always well perceived or popular in the community. I just think it as a way of submitting an application. And then it is easier for MKR voters to vote on a group if they wish/need/want to. With regards to multiple groups, PPGs or this one, while the idea of redundancy is nice, I believe the execution is not. (Greg we\u2019ll just agree to disagree here  ) In the current stage of  maturity of the DAO, redundancy is maybe too soon in my view. It can be rather inefficient, messy and confusing for MKR tokenholders. So I lean more towards good, efficient AND legitimate groups. But that \u201clegitimacy power\u201d warrants some sort of self-regulation in my view, internal or through voting. Otherwise, it evolves from legitimacy to cronyism. That is one of the biggest problems I see Maker facing already now and exponentiating in the future. I\u2019ve worked in banking for many years, it was full of cliquey self-appointed groups (\u201cclosed doors policy\u201d) for everything, including in risk management. Many of those groups were created well intentioned at the inception and evolved to cronyism overtime. I would rather not see Maker going down the same path. TLDR: If we do not want to go down the tradFi route, we need first to understand what tradFi does bad with regards to working group organisation and then how we can do better ",

I want to make it clear that I think the group itself is a good idea, and I think it makes a lot of sense to have a group of experts advising the DAO. My issues with this are solely based on the governance implications of passing this. I\u2019ll  summarize my objections here: #1 This committee has no powers beyond those of any community member. This is explicitly stated in the motivation section.     g_dip:  This committee will not have any explicit power in the governance process, contrary to most Core Units, but will be limited to making recommendations that may be \u201capproved\u201d by MKR holders via on-chain polls.   If this committee\u2019s power is limited to making recommendations to governance, then it doesn\u2019t need a MIP. Anyone can already make recommendations to governance by virtue of this being a DAO, governance might not listen to them, but anyone can make them. Ultimately this group could operate entirely without this MIP, and if it can, then it should (no need to add additional governance considerations for MKR Holders that already have a lot to deal with.) #2 Passing this MIP implies that the community is unable to make recommendations without working under a similar structure. Basically, if you pass a MIP that says \u2018This group has this power to do this thing\u2019 then it becomes more reasonable to ask why other groups / individuals are doing that same thing without a similar MIP.  Does governance want to have to approve groups of people before they can advise the DAO? It doesn\u2019t seem like a great implication to make. And at scale, this system is completely untenable. Maker Governance is not going to care when membership of one of twenty groups changes. #3 This MIP actually adds on-going governance burden. The requirement for governance to elect members to a group which can advise the DAO is even more pointless. anyone can advise the DAO. Maker governance should not be choosing who can or can\u2019t advise the DAO in either the general case (voting to approve groups like this,) or the specific case (choosing which individuals are part of these groups.) Furthermore, even beyond the election of people to a group that can do the same as everyone else in the DAO, there is a requirement for Maker governance to resolve the internal disagreement in the advisory group? Why should Maker governance care if the group disagrees internally? Just publish both points of view. And again with the other requirements\u2026 Why do MKR Holders need a say on how the group internally organises itself? On the quorum, on the pass threshold, etc. By all means implement and publicize these things, they are important things to include in any such group, and for transparency reasons, it would be great to include how votes fall out when the group makes these recommendations. But Maker Governance doesn\u2019t need to vote on how the group works! The group itself should manage this internally.  There is a reason I setup the PPG MIP the way I did. It adds zero governance burden, it just requires that groups existence, goals and members be publicized for transparency reasons, such that Maker Governance knows who is producing the given proposals and such that Governance Facilitators (or anyone frankly) can check that proposals are in-line with stated goals. If you want to setup a non-proposing PPG-similar framework. PRG? (parameter recommendation group), AG? (advisory group) then I think that\u2019s a fantastic idea - but the overall goal should always be to decrease the governance burden. Furthermore, if you did want to setup an AG (Advisory Group) framework, it would be better to set it up such that it can work for advisory groups in multiple areas - not just RWA. In general, having an AG framework seems like a good idea. The groups membership and goals will be publicly known, there wouldn\u2019t be any governance burden. Seems like a win-win. The DAO gets solid advice without having to concern itself with how these groups manage themselves. ",

As mentioned in this post I respectfully disagree with this logic. When making decisions, it\u2019s important to know where the legitimacy lies. In this instance, MKR holders could make much more informed and precise decisions around the overall RWA concept by controlling the inputs (individuals) that determine the output votes of the committee. This legitimacy of input will increase the legitimacy of the outputs - I feel as though that much is undeniable and therefore it is a worthy reason to use a MIP.     LongForWisdom:  #2 Passing this MIP implies that the community is unable to make recommendations without working under a similar structure.   I just completely disagree with this. There is no such implication.     LongForWisdom:  #3 This MIP actually adds on-going governance burden.   Since the committee doesn\u2019t have any crucial operating responsibilities, the MKR holders are able to completely ignore it after it is up and running if they are over-burdened. I think that once delegates are in place, governance burden will not be as much of an issue, but even so I think this is a worthy trade-off to add to the MKR holder\u2019s plates. Either way, it\u2019s up to them to decide if they want to take it on by voting for or against this MIP.
