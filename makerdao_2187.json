                    "content": "Intro Blue recently came out of stealth on CoinDesk with its $3.2M seed round. We\u2019ve been building an on/off-ramp solution that we believe would help drive liquidity to Maker. Overview Our product allows users to access their fiat bank account on Maker with just one click. This unlocks a user\u2019s largest source of liquidity, making it available on Maker through a stablecoin called USDCash. USDCash is an ERC20 token that is connected to a user\u2019s bank account through Plaid and other 3rd party integrations. When a user purchases USDCash on-chain, there is a USD deduction from their fiat bank account. This eliminates the need to on-ramp through CEXs or providers like MoonPay or Transak that can typically carry hefty fees. Example If a user wants to lend 500 DAI but does not have any DAI, they could click a simple call-to-action button on the Maker application that allows them to instantly on-ramp 500 USDCash and atomically swap 500 USDCash for DAI. In the background, we\u2019re capturing $500 USD from the user\u2019s bank account via ACH transfer, minting them 500 USDCash (backed by the $500 USD ACH pull), then swapping USDCash for DAI in a USDCash/DAI pool. Instant + Free We\u2019re using new technology on our backend that allows us to offer instant ACH transfers for the end user, making the on-ramp process instant. This differs from on-ramping providers today that rely on pre-funding and typically take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 days to capture USD payment. Additionally, we\u2019re  offering 0% fees for all on-ramps because we have an alternative source of revenue in the form of USD reserves that sit at a qualified custodian (a portion of reserves are invested in short-dated US Treasuries, similar to the business models of fiat-collateralized stablecoins). Below we have outlined how Blue compares to competitors. Summary  Maker can drive more liquidity to the protocol by connecting user\u2019s bank accounts to lend-borrow pools Users can on-ramp instantly with no fees First-time on-ramp requires a KYC/AML check & Plaid onboarding flow All on-ramps from fiat require 2FA authentication (irrespective of the amount) Uniswap recently made a similar integration with MoonPay (stats below on how we compare to other on-ramps) Our website is blue.fi  - we have completed security audits with Halborn and Verilog and the implementation would be a JS SDK that has been audited with code available for inspection by anyone        Blue MoonPay Transak     \u00a0Fees \u00a00% (cards)0% (ACH) \u00a04.5% (cards)1% (ACH) 3.99% (cards)0.99% (ACH)\u00a0   \u00a0Speed \u00a0Instant (ACH) ~30 mins (cards)2-3 days (ACH)\u00a0 \u00a0~3 hours (cards)2-3 days (ACH)   \u00a0KYC \u00a0Yes \u00a0Yes \u00a0Yes   \u00a0Tokens \u00a0Any (via trade routing) <100 tokens\u00a0 \u00a0<50 tokens     What we\u2019re asking for We\u2019re looking to integrate with Maker as a widget in the top corner of the frontend (similar to Uniswap\u2019s MoonPay integration) through a JS SDK. This will give users convenient, free, and instant access to their fiat bank account liquidity while on Maker. ",
