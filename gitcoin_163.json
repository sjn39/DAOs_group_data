Why do this? I would like to make this a trend.  Posting this information transparentyly makes it obvious to the afverage member of the DAO where and how the legitimacy of the consent of the governed flows in the DAO.  It also invites a conversation about who else in the DAO is doing great work so that I can update my delegations to point to them.  My take: This will be important as the DAO tunes Grants 2.0 to reach product market fit.  We gotta have the people who are learning from the front and have the context having governance power.  Call to action I invite other larger holders of GTC to post on a quarterly basis about where they are delegating their GTC.  Bottoms up Transparency I would also like to show off that @ivanmolto built an amazingly beautiful report that shows the top HODLers and where they are delegating. Check the report here.  Perhaps someone could take this + go through the list of holders, point them to this post + ask them to engage in a dialgoue about to whom they are delegating to and why? ",

I did the explorations about GTC holders delegating and GTC holders not delegating and while doing the data sanity check I found that this address Proxy | Address 0xd4567069c5a1c1fc8261d8ff5c0b1d98f069cf47 | Etherscan which I have identified as FDD WS Main account was delegating their 47454 GTC to lefteris.eth I am not saying that there is anything wrong with that. What I would like to know if this address is still a FDD Main account or it has transitioned to other roles or it is just a bug, etc. Much appreciated your help as I need to know about it to keep updated the dashboards. Thank you. ",

Early on after receiving our first budget we had our main multisig delegate to @lefterisjp This was because I viewed him as a highly critical steward who isn\u2019t afraid to speak his mind. We also asked him to oversee the workstream as a Multisig Keyholder which he did for 2 seasons before stepping back from that role. IT seemed a good idea to delegate to a steward who wasn\u2019t paid by the workstream, but was more deeply knowledgeable about what we were doing. I don\u2019t know of any policy around the workstream multisig delegations, we want to be inline with whatever policy the DAO chooses. Thanks for bringing this up @ivanmolto ",

For a long time, I have thought that it could be interesting for workstreams to delegate their GTC to stewards to engage and evangelise them about the workstreams\u2019 goals and jobs. Additionally, the GTC within workstreams will have other utilities on top of rewarding DAO contributors. But I was worried that this idea could be considered lobbying. Maybe this conversation could be the trigger for an open conversation for workstreams delegating their GTC. Thank you! ",
