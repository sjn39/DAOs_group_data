Not a browser extension, but a complete standalone desktop application providing a one-stop solution for seamless access and usability of DeFi, NFTs and cross-border payments, with a gateway to the world of Web3/DApps via the first desktop Web3 browser and Dapp store. Fulfilling all a user\u2019s decentralized needs in a single platform, while removing the complexities of decentralized finance and Web3, enabling economic freedom for everyone globally! Infinity Wallet was created to finally enable mass adoption, as a single access point to the entire decentralized world. We have focused on providing the best possible user experience, to lower the barrier to entry and allow for streamlined and secure adoption of DeFi and Web3. Providing a world-class user experience with a seamless user interface, and a full spectrum of constantly growing in-wallet features and services as a one-stop hub. Making Infinity Wallet the complete solution for all crypto users\u2019 needs, while making adoption and usage of cross-border payments, DeFi, NFTs and Web3 easier than ever before for mainstream adoption. Infinity Wallet is not just a unique one-stop wallet built for the masses, it is also the first desktop platform to provide users with access to the entire Web3 and DApp space without needing to leave their wallet, with the first Web3 browser and DApp store on desktop as a standalone App. Finally removing the need to use unintuitive, unfriendly and feature-lacking browser extension wallets ever again! Providing a far superior, safer and more natural user experience, with a range of unique advantages for users, DApps, and chains alike, enabling easier usage and adoption.

We also look to launch our highly anticipated mobile release later this year on Android and iOS, a sneak peak can be found below.  Mobile Wallet1500\u00d71030 274 KB   Date of deployment on Optimism: We developed out and integrated support for Optimism close to a year ago (6/2/2022)  Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?: As a well established platform supporting 46,000 MAU and over $600,000,000 TVH, with hundreds of thousands of users, Infinity Wallet has already seen good success even without providing incentives. We hope to see further success as we continue to build and redefine the wallet, DeFi and Web3 experience, as a complete one-stop solution made for the masses.  How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: Around 200k unique users (rolling 12 months of unique users that transacted via Infinity Wallet)  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: We look to boost user adoption in both the short and long-term, through the multiple grant distribution methods and the many advantages we provide, bringing long-term value to the Optimism ecosystem long after completion of the distributions:   Step 1 - Optimism awareness through awareness and learning campaigns/activities;   Step 2 - Incentivize users to bridge to Optimism to give it a try;   Step 3 - Incentivize users to try swapping on Optimism and see the benefits of lower gas costs and faster execution;   Step 4 - Bring awareness and ease of use to many Optimism Web3 projects on an ongoing basis, through our unique Web3 browser and DApp store. Which users would be ready to learn and interact with these OP projects after having already onboarded to Optimism. Aiming to create long-term user adoption of Optimism, through all the combined advantages of Infinity Wallet, Optimism, and integrated DApps!    Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: We look to primarily target and incentivize current and future Infinity Wallet users to learn about and try Optimism and Optimism DApps/Web3 projects for themselves. As we focus on providing a unique platform for ease of use and with many advanced features, this would include both developers and less tech-savvy users.  How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: The users would bridge to Optimism and have complete access to the Optimism ecosystem from within the Infinity Wallet (payments, Web3 browsing, portfolio management, NFTs, swapping etc.). As well as gain awareness of Optimism DApps/Web3 projects, which they can instantly interact with to try within their wallet. Through working with and attracting quality developers and DApps to integrate with Optimism and the Infinity Wallet, we hope to provide lasting value for users to remain indefinitely.  Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Website: https://infinitywallet.io/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/InfinityWallet  Technical/Economic Documentation: https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf    Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  46,000 MAU; $600,000,000+ TVH; 100,000+ users subscribed to be notified of mobile release; Most used chain is ETH;  Some metrics/evidence of Infinity Wallet\u2019s success:   Infinity Wallet desktop download activity Github Release Stats    Around 110,000 monthly website visits (https://www.similarweb.com/website/infinitywallet.io/)   BNB MVB IV selected project, and tweeted about multiple times by Binance and BNBChain twitter accounts (https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1524199862702551040 and https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1514270664978575365);   Top 10 voted project on KCC (https://twitter.com/KCCOfficialTW/status/152515227027848396);   Supported as a top 4 desktop connection option on Wallet Connect;    Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?: In the crypto and non-crypto space our current competitors are far from ideal for users. We are one of very few in the space redefining the wallet experience, creating a complete one-stop DeFi and Web3 solution focused on delivering a new and enhanced experience for less tech savvy users. A few general competitors can be found below: Partial competitors with accepted OP Proposal:  Tally Ho ([REVIEW][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism  Tally Ho  - 400,000 OP) - A general browser extension wallet with limited functionality and UX, that has significantly less traction/users; Rainbow ([Review][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism  Rainbow  - 420,069 OP) - A general mobile wallet with limited functionality; EdgeWallet ([GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Edge Wallet - (Integration of Optimism + Velodrome LP Staking / Swaps + Tarot LP Staking)  - 50,000 OP Builders Grant) - A general mobile wallet with an old and hard to use interface with limited UX;  Other competitors in the space could include a range of platforms from wallets, payment apps, portfolio/DeFi dashboards, NFTs, exchanges, bridges, staking platforms and much more.  Metamask (in terms of Web3/DApp access) Trust Wallet (in terms of mobile and Web3/DApp access) Exodus (in terms of UX, as like us they are focused on end users that are less tech-savvy)  Browser-extension wallets (competitors in access to Web3 & DApps) - These generally lack accessibility/usability, limited features/services, high fees, limited chain types, lack a standalone web3 browser, no live user support, and have an overall poor user experience. They act more as an interface than a wallet, with us finding that many of our users happily moved from other browser extension-wallets to the Infinity Wallet when they learned of us; Desktop wallets - These generally have no open access to DApps and Web3, poor user interface, high fees, lack a one-stop solution, provide few features/services, and have limited token support  What differentiates you from your competitors?: Infinity Wallet provides a unique wallet and the first Web3 browser solution on desktop, with a mobile version also in the works that will redefine the Crypto, DeFi & Web3 experience on mobile. Bringing a wide range of advantages, such as:   A unique platform in the space providing a complete experience in a standalone desktop app, rather than a browser extension. Delivering a high quality, one-stop user focused experience required for mass adoption;   The first desktop Web3 browser & DApp store. Finally freeing desktop users from having to use unintuitive and feature-lacking browser extension wallets to access Web3 and DApps. While providing a simpler, easy to use medium to access Web3 and discover DApps;   The Infinity Wallet enables users to directly connect to a DApp on the web, but also to connect with DApps that require connecting via their own downloadable software/app rather than a domain. Making Infinity Wallet the only desktop wallet to support true unlimited access to all of Web3;   An encompassing approach to provide an all-in-one multi-chain platform, supporting all chain types (EVM and non-EVM, L1 and L2) across the Infinity ecosystem. Enabling seamless use of all chains within a single platform, for easier interoperability between chains and removing the need for multiple wallets;   We are delivering a more curated in-wallet experience, with a focus on providing a far superior and seamless user experience, as a one-stop solution for all a user\u2019s DeFi, Web3, NFT, Crypto and Payment needs. With all features, services and protocols directly accessible within a single platform, and working with users on constant new developments to meet their demands;   We are actively solving issues within the space today. Such as, the need to learn and use multiple platforms, lack of live user DeFi & Web3 support to help users learn and onboard, lack of new innovation and limited features/services (limiting the user experience, along with user accessibility/usage), high fees, bad user experience and unprofessional user interfaces. With most other platforms built with a focus more on developers rather than less tech savvy end users;     Team   Who are your founders?: Our team is made up from individuals that have extensive experience in the space, with a complete crypto experience from Smart Contracts, DeFi/Web3 projects, DApp development, Wallet and more. Additionally, we have a general background in software development and UI/UX, as an already established ecosystem; Information on the core/founding team members can be found at the following link Infinity Wallet Core Team Information - Google Docs  What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? We are an already established project supporting hundreds of thousands of users globally. Built from the ground up as a complete self funded project, providing free to use infrastructure and a one-stop wallet/Web3 ecosystem. Additionally, our team members have between 5-10 years of experience within the space (as investors, miners and developers), so we have a vast amount of experience and understanding of major shortcomings in the market, along with what is needed to enable mass adoption.  Is this your first Web3 project?: No   Grant Request   What is the size of the grant request? 220,000 OP  How do you justify the size of the grant?: The allocation requested corresponds to the number of users, volume and overall adoption we plan to bring to Optimism, both from our existing community and through hundreds of thousands of new users that we onboard to the Infinity Wallet yearly.   Roadmap and Distribution Plan   Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: Once the growth grant is accepted we will allocate the required resources and begin the execution and launch of the Optimism incentives proposed. We expect that the incentives will go live within 4 weeks from grant acceptance. For the duration (4-6 months) of the grant incentives we will dedicate 2 team members to oversee the execution and management of the grant incentives. Additionally, on incentives going live we will have ongoing marketing campaigns and announcements to bring awareness to the incentives and Optimism. A breakdown of the specific activities that will be completed to drive awareness, growth and adoption of Optimism and the Optimism ecosystem can be found under the following question.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? We propose to distribute OP to incentivize and drive growth within the Optimism ecosystem, through user incentives and DApp awareness, to drive sustainable ecosystem usage and adoption of Optimism:   Bridge & Swap Incentives (50%, over 6 months) - OP will be distributed as an incentive for users to bridge funds onto Optimism through the Infinity Wallet. This would help to offset users\u2019 costs for bridging assets to Optimism, which the gas fees to bridge from ETH especially can be quite prohibitive for the average user. This will allow more users to onboard to and discover the Optimism ecosystem, leading to further usage and liquidity. OP will also be distributed as an incentive to users that swap on or on-ramp to Optimism inside Infinity Wallet, increasing volume across the chain and liquidity demand for DEXs. Users would have to meet certain requirements and there would be limits per user to ensure there are no sybil attacks.   Awareness/Usage Campaign (10%, over 3 months) - We will create a campaign in which we will reward OP to users that complete certain Optimism related activities (off and on-chain), to help drive awareness and entice new users to learn about and take part in the ecosystem.   DApp Developer Support & Adoption (40%, over 6 months) - Through integrating with OP DApps for use in the Infinity Wallet Web3 Browser & DApp store, and rewarding OP DApps that integrate with the Infinity Wallet. Providing developers on Optimism with significant advantages in discoverability and awareness to their projects via the Infinity DApp store, while making their project easier than ever to onboard to and use with the Infinity Web3 Browser. We will also launch awareness/marketing campaigns to make users aware of each DApp as part of this incentive. Helping to further drive user growth and awareness to the projects, Optimism, and the overall OP ecosystem, with NFT drops and other activities.    Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:  Bridge & Swap Incentives = 6 months Awareness/Usage Campaign = 3 months DApp Developer Support & Adoption = 6 months   Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. The milestones below will give a generalistic idea of the benchmarks that we look to achieve with the complete distribution for each initiative:   Swap & bridge incentives (50%):  Milestone KPI: $10,000,000+ in volume with limits per user (minimum of 3,000 unique users); Milestone amount: 110,000 OP;    Awareness Campaign (10%):  Milestone KPI: 6,000+ participants; Milestone amount: 22,000 OP;    Developer DApp Support & Adoption (40%):  Milestone KPI: 40+ OP DApps (with $200,000+ TVL or 500+ MAU) Milestone amount: 88,000 OP;     Please define critical milestones for this project. We would suggest 40% upfront with milestones based on specific KPIs when around 30% of the distribution method is complete, to unlock the remaining 60% for each distribution method. Initial amount: 88,000 OP (40%)   Swap & bridge incentives (50%):  Initial amount: 44,000 OP; Milestone KPI: $3,000,000+ in volume (1,000+ users); Milestone unlock amount: 66,000 OP;    Awareness Campaign (10%):  Initial amount: 8,800 OP; Milestone KPI: 2,000 participants; Milestone unlock amount: 13,200 OP;    Developer DApp Support & Adoption (40%):  Initial amount: 35,200 OP; Milestone KPI: 12 OP DApps (with $200,000+ TVL or 500+ MAU) Milestone unlock amount: 52,800 OP;    The milestone KPIs suggested would be achieved before their initial 40% allocation has been distributed, to ensure no break in the campaign distributions. The above critical milestone KPIs are based on around 75% of the initial OP (88,000 OP) being distributed (~30% of the total).  If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Infinity Wallet provides a unique, high quality user experience, making Optimism seamless to access and easy to use. Enabling users to onboard, interact and access all their needs on Optimism via a single point of access. We expect that once users discover and bridge to Optimism they will be happy to stay, due to the wealth of Optimism features and DApps easily accessible in their Infinity Wallet, and the problems that Optimism solves. Similarly to how our users enjoy using Infinity Wallet on an ongoing basis even though we offer no usage incentives, due to the real problems we solve in the crypto space on an ongoing basis.  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): OP Wallet Address - 0x15D645E363c6A2c83Bb3c55325C1Ca9E6936492E   Optimism Relationship   Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Wallets are the most fundamental component required for usage and adoption of DeFi, Web3, crypto payments, a chain and its ecosystem, however they are one of the least well developed applications in the crypto ecosystem. Today, wallets act mainly as an interface, serving primarily as a transaction signing layer, with very limited functionality or in-wallet features, requiring use of multiple platforms, and are generally lacking in basic UX, while providing very unprofessional, hard to use and aesthetically poor user interfaces, with most platforms built for developers rather than end users. This has been sufficient for the early adopters in crypto, however, for the next billion users to onboard, a more curated, frictionless and high quality user experience is required! Desktop Web3 wallet options are limited in particular, delivering very little in terms of new innovation, or solving today\u2019s issues, while requiring the user to install a browser extension, which is not the natural flow. Overall delivering an unintuitive and feature-lacking user experience, with limited or no native support for OP and its ecosystem/DApps, greatly restricting the possibility for discoverability and adoption. For Optimism to compete and attract users and developers, it needs a one-stop wallet super app providing a seamless user experience, to enable users to onboard and adopt Optimism, and discover the OP ecosystem as their home.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Wallets are the core component required for any chain, enabling users to interact and onboard to Optimism, and access the OP ecosystem (DApps, DeFi, Web3, NFTs and much more). Making wallets the defining factor for usage and adoption of a chain and its entire ecosystem. As a top desktop wallet redefining the wallet experience, while already supporting hundreds of thousands of users, we can provide significant exposure and growth to Optimism from our current and constantly growing user base. Introducing Optimism to our users through incentives to drive growth and awareness to the overall Optimism ecosystem. Enticing new users to onboard and learn/explore the Optimism ecosystem, which is vital for Optimisms growth! A seamless, user-friendly and one-stop wallet experience is necessary to enable onboarding of new users directly to Optimism, and for users to continue to explore the ecosystem to drive continuous on-going usage, adoption and discoverability. By incentivizing users and enabling discoverability of Optimism DApps/developers, it will bring increased awareness and adoption of Optimism to a previously untapped user base, attracting them to explore and use the Optimism ecosystem. While providing a seamless access point to interact with and onboard to Optimism, and enhancing the ability to discover, as well as improving ease of use of Optimism DApps for developers and users alike.  Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes, we provide default support for Optimism as a native chain, allowing users to start using Optimism straight away.   Confirmations   I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes  I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: Yes ",

Not a browser extension, but a complete standalone desktop application providing a one-stop solution for seamless access and usability of DeFi, NFTs and cross-border payments, with a gateway to the world of Web3/DApps via the first desktop Web3 browser and Dapp store. Fulfilling all a user\u2019s decentralized needs in a single platform, while removing the complexities of decentralized finance and Web3, enabling economic freedom for everyone globally! Infinity Wallet was created to finally enable mass adoption, as a single access point to the entire decentralized world. We have focused on providing the best possible user experience, to lower the barrier to entry and allow for streamlined and secure adoption of DeFi and Web3. Providing a world-class user experience with a seamless user interface, and a full spectrum of constantly growing in-wallet features and services as a one-stop hub. Making Infinity Wallet the complete solution for all crypto users\u2019 needs, while making adoption and usage of cross-border payments, DeFi, NFTs and Web3 easier than ever before for mainstream adoption. Infinity Wallet is not just a unique one-stop wallet built for the masses, it is also the first desktop platform to provide users with access to the entire Web3 and DApp space without needing to leave their wallet, with the first Web3 browser and DApp store on desktop as a standalone App. Finally removing the need to use unintuitive, unfriendly and feature-lacking browser extension wallets ever again! Providing a far superior, safer and more natural user experience, with a range of unique advantages for users, DApps, and chains alike, enabling easier usage and adoption. Below are some of the many infrastructure and features/services of the Infinity Wallet:   Portfolio and Analytics Monitoring/Dashboard -  portfolio management2298\u00d71201 183 KB    One-stop DeFi Wallet Solution with a strong focus on user experience -  wallet management2298\u00d71201 201 KB     Send USDC OP2298\u00d71201 133 KB    First desktop Web3 Browser (One-click connect and transact with Web3 DApps, with utmost discoverability and use of a chains\u2019 ecosystem) This removes the need for unfriendly and feature-lacking browser extensions to access Web3 and decentralized applications on desktop -  web3 browser2298\u00d71201 155 KB    Web3 DApp Store (Enables easier DApp & ecosystem discoverability, adoption and usage) -  web3 dapp store1200\u00d7627 273 KB    Cross-chain swap & bridge (Swap/Bridge between multiple supported chains) -  swap &amp; bridge2298\u00d71201 173 KB    In-wallet decentralized exchange aggregator -  dex aggregator2298\u00d71201 152 KB    NFT support and Gallery to manage (view, send and receive) and easily trade NFTs -  nft wallet1200\u00d7627 359 KB     NFT Individual Screen2298\u00d71201 291 KB    Fiat on/off Ramp (enabling easy and direct onboarding into crypto and supported chains) -  buy and sell crypto2298\u00d71201 141 KB    Complete Transaction History for all transaction types with DApp resolving and balance/performance tracking -  advanced transaction history2298\u00d71201 213 KB    Custom Token Importing (Allowing any token to be imported on any supported chain) -  custom token importing2298\u00d71201 149 KB    Live user and chain support, with a focus on delivering the best possible user experience to make onboarding for users as easy and seamless as possible   For a detailed look over our many other features/services and future development roadmap please see our information deck available at https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf, or our docs at Features & Notable Advancements - Infinity Wallet (detailing further information on core features/services and secondary features). We also look to launch our highly anticipated mobile release later this year on Android and iOS, a sneak peak can be found below.  Mobile Wallet1500\u00d71030 274 KB   Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: We are a live and well adopted decentralized all-in-one platform, solving many issues within the space today. We have additionally seen a high user demand through our live support, which has received many requests from Optimism users to expand Optimism support, since we integrated and built out support for Optimism at a basic level over a year ago.  Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Infinity Wallet brings significant advances in the usability and awareness of Optimism and its ecosystem. This would attract new potential Optimism developers looking to provide the best experience for their project (DApps, Tokens and NFTs).  Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Infinity Wallet enables Optimism developers to leverage our unique functionality, for enhanced usability and awareness of their project (DApps, Tokens and NFTs). This would enable current Optimism developers to create easier to use DApps.  Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Integration with the Infinity Wallet would allow Optimism developers to benefit from easier usability and a wide range of features for their projects (DApps, Tokens and NFTs), as well as ongoing discoverability and adoption, with the potential to bring them greater usage/volume/fees, incentivizing them to continue to build on Optimism.  Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Website: https://infinitywallet.io/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/InfinityWallet  Technical/Economic Documentation: https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf    Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  46,000 MAU; $600,000,000+ TVH; 100,000+ users subscribed to be notified of mobile release; Most used chain is ETH;  Some metrics/evidence of Infinity Wallet\u2019s success:   Infinity Wallet desktop download activity Github Release Stats   Around 110,000 monthly website visits (https://www.similarweb.com/website/infinitywallet.io/)   BNB MVB IV selected project, and tweeted about multiple times by Binance and BNBChain twitter accounts (https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1524199862702551040 and https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1514270664978575365);   Top 10 voted project on KCC (https://twitter.com/KCCOfficialTW/status/152515227027848396);   Supported as a top 4 desktop connection option on Wallet Connect;    Who are your competitors?: In the crypto and non-crypto space our current competitors are far from ideal for users. We are one of very few in the space redefining the wallet experience, creating a complete one-stop DeFi and Web3 solution focused on delivering a new and enhanced experience for less tech savvy users. A few general competitors can be found below: Partial competitors with accepted OP Proposal:  Tally Ho ([REVIEW][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism  Tally Ho - 400,000 OP) - A general browser extension wallet with limited functionality and UX, that has significantly less traction/users; Rainbow ([Review][GF Phase 1 Proposal] Optimism  Rainbow - 420,069 OP) - A general mobile wallet with limited functionality; EdgeWallet ([GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Edge Wallet - (Integration of Optimism + Velodrome LP Staking / Swaps + Tarot LP Staking) - 50,000 OP Builders Grant) - A general mobile wallet with an old and hard to use interface with limited UX;  Other competitors in the space could include a range of platforms from wallets, payment apps, portfolio/DeFi dashboards, NFTs, exchanges, bridges, staking platforms and much more.  Metamask (in terms of Web3/DApp access) Trust Wallet (in terms of mobile and Web3/DApp access) Exodus (in terms of UX, as like us they are focused on end users that are less tech-savvy)  Browser-extension wallets (competitors in access to Web3 & DApps) - These generally lack accessibility/usability, limited features/services, high fees, limited chain types, lack a standalone web3 browser, no live user support, and have an overall poor user experience. They act more as an interface than a wallet, with us finding that many of our users happily moved from other browser extension-wallets to the Infinity Wallet when they learned of us; Desktop wallets - These generally have no open access to DApps and Web3, poor user interface, high fees, lack a one-stop solution, provide few features/services, and have limited token support  What differentiates you from your competitors?: Infinity Wallet provides a unique wallet and the first Web3 browser solution on desktop, with a mobile version also in the works that will redefine the Crypto, DeFi & Web3 experience on mobile. Bringing a wide range of advantages, such as:   A unique platform in the space providing a complete experience in a standalone desktop app, rather than a browser extension. Delivering a high quality, one-stop user focused experience required for mass adoption;   The first desktop Web3 browser & DApp store. Finally freeing desktop users from having to use unintuitive and feature-lacking browser extension wallets to access Web3 and DApps. While providing a simpler, easy to use medium to access Web3 and discover DApps;   The Infinity Wallet enables users to directly connect to a DApp on the web, but also to connect with DApps that require connecting via their own downloadable software/app rather than a domain. Making Infinity Wallet the only desktop wallet to support true unlimited access to all of Web3;   An encompassing approach to provide an all-in-one multi-chain platform, supporting all chain types (EVM and non-EVM, L1 and L2) across the Infinity ecosystem. Enabling seamless use of all chains within a single platform, for easier interoperability between chains and removing the need for multiple wallets;   We are delivering a more curated in-wallet experience, with a focus on providing a far superior and seamless user experience, as a one-stop solution for all a user\u2019s DeFi, Web3, NFT, Crypto and Payment needs. With all features, services and protocols directly accessible within a single platform, and working with users on constant new developments to meet their demands;   We are actively solving issues within the space today. Such as, the need to learn and use multiple platforms, lack of live user DeFi & Web3 support to help users learn and onboard, lack of new innovation and limited features/services (limiting the user experience, along with user accessibility/usage), high fees, bad user experience and unprofessional user interfaces. With most other platforms built with a focus more on developers rather than less tech savvy end users;    Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Yes, we will be looking at working closely with Optimism projects on integration across all areas, from DeFi to NFTs, and GameFi etc.   Team   Who are your founders?: Our team is made up from individuals that have extensive experience in the space, with a complete crypto experience from Smart Contracts, DeFi/Web3 projects, DApp development, Wallet and more. Additionally, we have a general background in software development and UI/UX, as an already established ecosystem; Information on the core/founding team members can be found at the following link Infinity Wallet Core Team Information - Google Docs  What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project: We are an already established project supporting hundreds of thousands of users globally. Built from the ground up as a complete self funded project, providing free to use infrastructure and a one-stop wallet/Web3 ecosystem. Additionally, our team members have between 5-10 years of experience within the space (as investors, miners and developers), so we have a vast amount of experience and understanding of major shortcomings in the market, along with what is needed to enable mass adoption.  Is this your first Web3 project?: No  I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1 year lock-up, as explained further in this post : YES  Is your project funded? Infinity Wallet has been in live use and constantly built on for almost 3 years, as a self funded platform/ecosystem.   Grant Request   What is the size of the grant request? 50,000 OP  How do you justify the size of the grant? The grant amount would enable us to build out further Optimism support across a wide range of other features/services/infrastructure. As well as integrate additional Optimism projects (DApps, Tokens and NFTs) in an effort to drive easier ecosystem discoverability and adoption for developers building on Optimism. While enabling users to have an improved experience and usage of Optimism DApps, with the ability to learn about OP projects.   Roadmap   Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project: Once the grant is accepted we will begin the outlined integrations/developments to expand Optimism, within 4 weeks from grant acceptance. Our team will complete the outlined integrations and infrastructure/developments within an estimated 3-4 months, and provide ongoing DApp and Token support for free to Optimism ecosystem projects that meet our general requirements. Additionally, we will provide ongoing support for Optimism into future developments on our overall roadmap on a case by case basis. Some of the many future developments we have planned on our roadmap that could benefit Optimism can be found in our information deck on page 27 here: https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf  (eg. Mobile release, Hardware wallet, Lending/Borrowing, DeFi Indexes and more).  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) OP Wallet Address - 0x15D645E363c6A2c83Bb3c55325C1Ca9E6936492E  Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: Not entirely, however it would greatly speed up and enable us to focus on further building out OP and support the OP developer ecosystem.  What is your plan for the use of the OP token after the 1 year lock-up?: After the 1 year lock-up our team would cover the costs associated with building out the Optimism developments and support. If after the 1 year period OP is valued higher than it is today, the remaining funds would be used to continue to build out on-going support of Optimism into future developments and features (eg. Mobile Release, Lending/Borrowing, Hardware wallet and more).  Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period.   Live release on standalone desktop app, with support for Optimism NFT Gallery and Manager, enabling users to send, receive, view all Optimism NFTs, view each individual NFT and its details, view transaction history, and easily click to trade NFTs, via a single interface;   Live release on standalone desktop app, with support for fiat on/off ramp integration for Optimism, enabling a single point of access for users to easily onboard and start using/accessing Optimism and the Optimism Ecosystem;   Live release on standalone desktop app, with support for Optimism Dex Aggregation, integrating and expanding support of Optimism DEXs for decentralized swapping, enabling them access to a large user base and volume;   Live release on standalone desktop app, with Optimism Social Wallet support, removing the need for a seed phrase and enabling users to create an Optimism wallet via social login, allowing for easier onboarding and usage of Optimism and the Optimism Ecosystem by the general web2 user;   Ongoing support for OP DApps that meet our general requirements in the Web3 DApp store for free, and further collaborate with project\u2019s developers. Targeting collaboration with 25+ OP DApps;   Support Optimism Tokens that meet our general requirements with free integrations into the Infinity Wallet ecosystem as default tokens. Removing the need for them to be imported and allowing for instant usability across the Infinity Wallet and features/services, while enabling easier discoverability and awareness of projects by users. Targeting collaboration with 20+ OP projects;   Integrate various Optimism protocols for contract resolving, enabling DApp transactions to be decoded and linked to a specific protocol. Targeting 25+ OP protocols;   Continue to support Optimism upgrades, maintenance and expand Optimism support across a wide range of future Infinity Wallet developments on a case by case basis;    Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.   Critical Milestone 1 (by May 5th, 2023) - We will deploy the ability for Optimism Dex Aggregation support within the Infinity Wallet, enabling aggregation of OP DEXs within a single one-stop platform and enabling DEXs to access the Infinity Wallet user base;   Critical Milestone 2 (by (June 30th, 2023) - We will deploy functionality for Optimism users and developers to store, send, receive, view, manage and easily trade Optimism NFTs;   Critical Milestone 3 (by July 30th, 2023) -  We will deploy the ability for Optimism users and developers to buy or sell OP and ETH OP directly within the Infinity Wallet, enabling onboarding and easy access to Optimism and the Optimism Ecosystem;   Critical Milestone 4 (before 1 year lockup end) - We will support a minimum of 15 DApps/Developers;   Critical Milestone 5 (before 1 year lockup end) - We will support a minimum of 15 OP ecosystem Tokens with default integrations into the Infinity Wallet and features/services;     Optimism Relationship   Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem?: Wallets are the most fundamental component required for usage and adoption of DeFi, Web3, crypto payments, a chain and its ecosystem, however they are one of the least well developed applications in the crypto ecosystem. Today, wallets act mainly as an interface, serving primarily as a transaction signing layer, with very limited functionality or in-wallet features, requiring use of multiple platforms, and are generally lacking in basic UX, while providing very unprofessional, hard to use and aesthetically poor user interfaces, with most platforms built for developers rather than end users. This has been sufficient for the early adopters in crypto, however, for the next billion users to onboard, a more curated, frictionless and high quality user experience is required! Desktop Web3 wallet options are limited in particular, delivering very little in terms of new innovation, or solving today\u2019s issues, while requiring the user to install a browser extension, which is not the natural flow. Overall delivering an unintuitive and feature-lacking user experience, with limited or no native support for OP and its ecosystem/DApps, greatly restricting the possibility for discoverability and adoption. For Optimism to compete and attract users and developers, it needs a one-stop wallet super app providing a seamless user experience, to enable users to onboard and adopt Optimism, and discover the OP ecosystem as their home.  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Infinity Wallet steps in as a one-stop hub for all payment, DeFi, NFT and Web3 activity. Providing a unique all-in-one standalone wallet solution and first Web3 browser with DApp store, removing the need for unfriendly and feature-less browser extension wallets. Enabling easier usage, onboarding and discoverability of Optimism and its ecosystem, along with a full spectrum of in-wallet services, features and protocols, as an all-in-one wallet super app for all a user\u2019s decentralized needs! We are focused on redefining the wallet experience and solving today\u2019s issues, delivering a premium platform and enhancing the user experience, while providing a user centric interface for a frictionless and high quality decentralized experience that users are generally used to with web2/centralized solutions. Lowering the barrier to entry, to allow for easy onboarding and true adoption of DeFi, crypto payments & Web3 globally, while allowing users to maintain complete privacy and self-custody!  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Wallets are the core component required for usage of any chain. We would enable users to more easily interact with and onboard to Optimism, as well as access the OP ecosystem (DApps, DeFi, Web3, NFTs and much more). Making Infinity Wallet the defining factor for usage, discoverability and adoption of Optimism and its entire ecosystem! Infinity Wallet would provide a complete user-friendly one-stop experience in a single platform, necessary to enable onboarding of new users directly to Optimism, and for users to continue to explore the ecosystem to drive continuous ongoing usage, adoption and discoverability. Additionally, as a top desktop wallet and one-stop ecosystem in the space redefining the wallet experience, while already supporting hundreds of thousands of users, we can provide significant exposure and growth to the Optimism ecosystem from our current and constantly growing user base.  How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: We have already invested in Optimism with development and integration of initial support for Optimism more than a year ago as one of the first projects to do so (Wallet, Web3 Browser, Cross-chain Swaps and Bridge), and are now looking to expand our support for Optimism with additional features, integrations and support for the developer ecosystem.  Is your project Optimism Native?: Yes, we provide default support for Optimism as a native chain, allowing users to start using Optimism straight away.   Confirmations   I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: YES  I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: YES ",

Critical milestones look good, but I\u2019m not entirely clear on how to differentiate these from the benchmark milestones, which are also effectively deployment milestones. I think you could stand to include some benchmark milestones that demonstrate not just progress but success of this program, something that tracks use, onboarding, connections, etc. Completion of benchmark milestones is not required for the full award of a grant; rather, the completion or non-completion of benchmark milestones will inform the community of a proposer\u2019s commitment to the Optimism community and may factor into future grant decisions. For more information on milestones here\u2019s a link: Milestone Assessment ",

Regarding publicly tracking new OP users and onboarding, as an EOA wallet users generate unlinked private addresses, so it wouldn\u2019t be possible to verify their usage stats publicly. However, in our benchmark milestones we listed some extra goals that could be publicly tracked, which we hope to achieve on top of the critical milestones. Regarding connections, we have listed in the critical milestones how many projects/developers we look to collaborate with. We could also add a target amount in the benchmark milestones as well? ",
