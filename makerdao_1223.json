This piece reflects only my own thoughts.  1308\u00d7984 374 KB  As Maker proceeds, we must check-in along the way to ensure that our decision-making apparatus, or governance, remains effective. Rather than tear up the playbook, we should look towards history for lessons in how to best adapt our system to an ever-changing environment. What history tells us is that, as organisms, societies, countries, or companies grow more complex, those that are successful adopt specialization. As they do so, they can grow even more complex. The human brain is divided into semi-autonomous regions that execute within distinct cognitive domains, say motor movements or visual interpretation. The United States is just that, a collection of semi-sovereign states, each of which manage local priorities and decisions. Without superb reasoning to suggest otherwise, Maker should adapt its organization structure to reflect this natural law. What\u2019s the Problem? Maker\u2019s product has grown too complex for the governance apparatus that manages it. Definitions Specialization: clusters, communities, or groups focus and execute on distinct categories of activity. By demonstrating competence , such units earn a high level of autonomy to act within their respective domains. With specific consideration toward MakerDAO, I\u2019d consider core units such as Real World Finance (RWF), Legal and Transactional Services (LTS), and Collateral Engineering Services (CES) to be part of a single Cluster. Framing: Organizational Structure of MakerDAO Maker consists of two primary functions, a software protocol and a decision-making apparatus that manages that protocol. Product and Governance, respectively. Maker is meant to generate economic value. It is not a non-profit organization. Product: DAI. Implemented through crypto lending, the PSM, the D3M, and RWAs. The protocol is a set of rules that determine under what conditions DAI is issued and burnt. Governance: MKR token holders, delegates, core unit contributors, and the community. Governance should guide the protocol in such a way that A) maintains the strength of DAI\u2019s peg to the dollar and B) scales the demand for DAI. If governance is functioning correctly, a stable DAI and demand for that DAI should drive subsequent lending revenues to the treasury. Through executive voting, MKR token holders hold supreme responsibility to chart the course of the protocol. This supreme responsibility is distributed across a wide MKR holder base to prevent 51% attacks by self-interested parties. Current State of the Nation  1600\u00d7839 153 KB  The scope of executive votes and governance polls spans the entirety of DAO activities, from broad, strategic decisions (e.g. Add RWAs as business line) to granular ones (e.g. prioritize RWA collateral). Maker is functionally a micro-management machine. As structured, voters, whether MKR holders or those to whom they delegate, are ultimately responsible for understanding the details and context of each and every core unit\u2019s activities in the DAO. (I have spent fourteen hours a day for nine months inside Maker and still can\u2019t understand it all) As a result, most large token holders either delegate or remain dormant. Of 901K in circulating MKR, the average executive vote receives approximately 80K of voted MKR, a 9% participation rate. The reason no one shows up to the ballot box is due to the sheer complexity of Maker today. Complexity requires time, effort, and context to parse. Delegates are stuck between a rock and a hard place: either vote on all issues, even those in which you do not have expertise, or lose delegation as a result of inaction. Large funds tend to remain passive indefinitely, neither delegating nor participating directly\u2014institutions are reluctant to delegate because it signals a lack of sophistication but are equally reluctant to vote due to a lack of resources required to parse the complexity. At some point, perhaps in the post-SAI and pre-RWA era, our decision-making structure made sense. But now the complexity of Maker\u2019s product has outgrown its brain. No one should be expected to make informed decisions at every level of the hierarchy, from strategic direction to day-to-day, across every domain, from rate setting to RWAs. The issue lies not in the delegates, large token holders, core units, nor any other individual component but rather the basic design of governance. It\u2019s simply impractical for current needs.  1228\u00d7916 208 KB  For the sake of impact, I will spell out the irony I see in Maker governance. Because MKR holders vote on everything, as the DAO becomes more complex, voter truancy will continue to grow. As truancy grows, decision making becomes highly centralized. Our variety of \u201cliquid democracy\u201dhas watered the seeds of \u201cliquid autocracy\u201d. Ironically, we\u2019ve invited censorship, the very threat that decentralized governance sought to dismantle in the first place, back to Maker\u2019s doorstep. Future State of the Nation: Where Governance Needs to Go To cope with increased complexity, Maker must adopt specialization. Specialization occurs naturally in free markets because it\u2019s dominant: the knowledge required for solutions is distributed among individuals, rather than concentrated in a central authority. Maker purports to acknowledge the local knowledge problem through \u201cdecentralization\u201d, but in reality is plagued with the worst of both worlds. Governance is distributed amongst the many but most don\u2019t vote due to complexity, making it ineffective. Core units, meant to solve that complexity locally, are impotent because they must submit all activity back to the governance apparatus, which again, is ineffective.  1472\u00d71042 141 KB  Solution Part 1: Less is More Rather than act as a universal voting committee (referendum-maxi model), Governors will make fewer, more directional decisions around hiring, firing, budgeting, and \u201ccorporate\u201d actions. I.e. less MKR voting on non-strategic items. Rather than make battle decisions, you\u2019d plot the direction of the war. Does raising debt capital to pursue a growth strategy make sense? Should 20% of costs be cut in a bear market? Should a core unit\u2019s budget be approved? If it enhances DAI network effects while sacrificing \u201chardness\u201d, should MakerDAO onboard \u201cunsecured\u201d debt? Should the protocol adopt an official ESG mandate? Instead of monitoring the forums 24/7, the Governors would sit-in on key progress updates from Mandated Actors and coalesce monthly to deal with critical, directional issues only. This change would invite large token holders to participate alongside existing and new delegates, enhancing decentralization of thought and decision making. To implement this change, we\u2019d cleave the decision-making apparatus in two: (1) The Governors (2) Clusters. This is not, in principle, dissimilar from MetaDAOs. It differs, however, in that it seeks to isolate and correct a governance mismatch with minimal existential disruption to the scaling of core business lines. Solution Part 2: Specializing With regard to how Clusters are managed, the Governors would focus solely on appointing/removing best in-class facilitators and approving/removing the budgets of core units, who might collectively form a Cluster such as Real World Assets. An RWA Cluster might include LTS, RWF, and CES and would focus on all collateral for which credit risk existed (i.e. off-chain credit, unsecured on-chain lending, secured on-chain lending etc., not crypto-lending). All but the highest-level decisions must be exported to the core units themselves. This includes prioritization of the collateral pipeline as per the strategic mandate set by the Governors. Note: I was deliberate in homing in on Real World Assets. RWAs most incisively the weaknesses in contemporary governance. It is extremely complex, yet not managed by those most equipped to understand the complexity. Specialization of function without autonomy in execution is free market theatre. Core units should, and I would argue must, be given a remit to act more autonomously within the domains they were hired to understand. Finally, highly complex domains like structuring credit risk exposures (RWA Cluster) will need an independent review mechanism. Whether assets are funded through traditional off-chain structures or more nimble D3M-like deployments, neither the finance tourist nor the engineering tourist will fully appreciate the nuance in building a sturdy bridge between credit assets and Maker. This independent function should be staffed with highly competent individuals with a demonstrated track record and ownership of MKR. Solution Part 3: Tracking Progress For Clusters to earn their keep, we\u2019ll need a mechanism for feedback and subsequent resource allocation. This will enable the Governors to dynamically allocate resources effectively. I trust that other members of the DAO (e.g. SES, LOVE, StratFI) will be able to craft much more effective feedback mechanisms than I can. My only recommendation would be: rather than assay performance based on vanity metrics (knowledge problem), Maker should create a structure by which core units can evaluate the performance of other core units. Should the Governors regard such evaluations as legitimate, they may adjust the purse strings accordingly. Summary Although I take issue with both the ambit of and sequence by which Endgame came into being, it correctly identifies a few core issues. These include specialization and solving MKR voter truancy. Rather than restructure the foundation of Maker, as Endgame contemplates, I think both of these issues can more immediately and less disruptively be solved by adjusting the decision-making framework. What we are building (the product) may actually be less complex than what this piece suggests. (It is only natural at Maker to over-complicate what should be simple). But we\u2019ve constructed governance such that everyone is thinking about everything all the time. Everything Everywhere All At Once. This chaos can be extinguished via a coherent vision and specialized execution of that vision. Governors align on what a five or ten-year success looks like, perhaps DAI as money. Core units pilot the ship to the promised land. Anticipating the Contra The fact that core units don\u2019t have more autonomy is, I believe, a function of the looming spectre of \u201ccentralization\u201d and \u201cgatekeeping\u201d. Community and token holders worry that core units with too much power will somehow bend the protocol towards their own ends. Of course, it is reasonable to be dubious of those with levers. However, given that we rely on MKR appreciation, we are incentivized to build something that is long-term valuable, rather than seize short-term opportunities. I\u2019ve always found it difficult to understand these \u201cgate-keeping\u201d arguments. Why would domain experts who could be paid 2x or more salary elsewhere make decisions that fail to maximize the long-term value of their tokens? Further, When considering if core units evaluating other core units makes sense, please also consider the above logic. ",

I think what @teej has proposed could be implemented more easily, with less disruption to the ongoing operation of the Dao (obviously subject to agreement of the core units and definition of how these clusters would operate) so if quicker action is required by governance holders this may be a parallel/transitory approach that could be taken whilst experimenting with the MetaDaos. 100% agree that having the clusters revolve around product has a lot of potential upside especially when confronting the challenge of developing new approaches to financing that are highly scalable. As a contributor who has only been at the DAO for only 2 months my primary observation with respect to real world assets, is that the current approach, primarily using MIP21, is not scalable. The main reasons being transparency and the large reliance on manual monitoring of off-chain data. As well as manually having to trigger liquidations. This approach can only continue for so long before, we start having to staff up like a conventional TradFi bank in order to effectively monitor and manage these deals. Ignoring, all the decisions that governance token holders will need to vote on for the custom management of these MIP21s if their growth continues. With a clustered approach we could focus on developing more scalable ways to grow real world assets, whilst enhancing transparency, and ultimately scaling real world collateral for on-chain liquidations using the combined expertise of engineering and finance specialists.  The endgame being a set of custom real world vaults and associated real world asset token standards that would easily facilitate the wholesale funding of assets as well as the development of secondary markets to facilitate liquidations. With respect to @teej\u2019s proposal I think that it would be important to define how the core units would cluster, specifically developing an approach that rationalizes budgeting and other core unit overhead and gets buy-in from each of the core unit teams. Based on my experiences as a core unit contributor to date definitely feel that this idea should be explored further in parallel with @rune s. ",

I have received this feedback from two different groups of large holders. My guess is part of the pitch to LPs is geared around a unique ability to understand and affect the trajectory of a protocol. I agree with you fully though. It is both more reasonable and probably more effective, thus more accretive, to \u201cunderwrite an underwriter\u201d (delegate) rather than parsing through the minutiae of the 5 DeFi protocols in which you hold a stake. In such a case, the subject fund would A) have some rather than no say in the governance of a protocol and B) free up resources to go be effective in other parts of the portfolio. Both results seem to improve fiduciary execution.     ACREinvest:  What I like about your approach here is that it gives a stronger role for the people who are the most knowledgable and talented caretakers of the DAO - the CUs.   A model that does not empower those with local knowledge to solve local problems is always going to be inferior to one that does.     ACREinvest:  My question is how we could implement this approach with a mechanism that supplements that current Recognized Delegate program as per conversation in this thread. Do you suggest Delegates make individual proposals?   A cohesive, multi-year plan for both product and governance is baking. Some of the best people in the DAO (my view) are on it. I recognize that thus far, at least on broad strategic items, I\u2019ve mainly waxed philosophical. Proposing abstract criticism without concrete improvements is of limited value. Stay posted. Broadly, delegates should absolutely make proposals\u2014and I think the providential ones will start doing just that. The composition of active MKR is changing rapidly. Big funds are looking for trustable, competent platforms to get behind, as everyone knows this next stage is critical. For whatever reason, we have perverted the climate such that Governors (delegates) feel it is not their role (presumably not in their best interests) to propose changes to the status quo. I think this is mainly a function of the active MKR breakdown. It\u2019s been mainly Rune. As such, the risk to upsetting Rune and losing delegation outweighs the potential spoils to active value-add. But the big funds are awakening. And with that, the potential upside for vanguard delegates will off-set the risk to losing delegation. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m imagining a sort of interactive and interdependent body consisting of delegates and voting committees (perhaps \u201cdelegate clusters\u201d?). The individual delegates would represent a metaDAO/CU and be expected to have deep knowledge about the inner goings on there \u2013 perhaps each metaDAO could hold two or three. Then the delegate clusters would represent the Maker core, and they would have platforms and far reaching aims for Maker as a whole. People only interested in their particular metaDAO could delegate to their own group\u2019s representatives, whereas people who want to engage on a more high concept level could delegate to the core delegate clusters, or to a mix of the two. When voting occurs, these clusters at the core could either vote as normal or push their MKR over to a delegate in the affected metaDAO who typically matches their platform\u2019s goals. Or for votes where the metaDAO\u2019s delegates feel they don\u2019t have enough information, they can push their part of the voting power over to the core, or perhaps directly to a delegate in another mD. This way there can be an intentional, simple root structure where the voting power and key information can move in either direction, generally towards those with the knowledge best suited towards making a good vote decision, while keeping the MKR usage high for each vote. This would contribute to the sovereignty of discrete groups within Maker, while retaining checks and balances amongst themselves as a body. Additionally, this would avoid the current issue where delegates are all expected to know everything about anything related to Maker. With the current delegate system, overstimulation will only get worse as the organization scales and delegates\u2019 knowledge becomes more and more diluted. A structure like this would dramatically increase the scalability of the organization while simultaneously improving the quality of both granular and far-reaching vote decisions. For those who might say that these kinds of voting systems add unnecessary complexity to Maker, I would wonder how the current system doesn\u2019t just consign the already present complexity onto the nervous systems of our delegates. Taking a stab. Thoughts?  ",

Personally, before I became a Recognized Delegate I proposed and tested some of the Wackiest Ideas, such as:  Expansion of DAI into Solana and NEAR Regulatory Compliance initiatives for makerDAO  And many other Delegates here have also issued proposals that have moved forward and/or failed. But yes, I agree\u2013as Recognized Delegates we should take the initiative to create more proposals. I do disagree with your assessment that Recognized Delegates are afraid of upsetting Rune, when in fact the guy hasn\u2019t even been involved until recently. He allowed this DAO to flow freely and allow Core Units, Delegates who wished to align, and MKR token owners who got up from their couches and participated. And even if we thought he would get upset, I doubt any of the Delegates would shy away from voting their view. Delegates aren\u2019t afraid of their delegated MKR being taken away. There\u2019s more to life than MakerDAO. Just like Core Units, Delegates have been given a fair chance to govern this protocol and some of us wanted to support our Core Units vision. And if that view wasn\u2019t good enough, hey at least we tried. And No, I never once ask Rune to tell me how to vote. The guy let us ride it out and I think all in all Recognized Delegates have done a swell job with the limited resources they\u2019ve been given. And even if I wasn\u2019t a Delegate, I would still vote with my own MKR the same way I have voted to date. Believe that. ",
