                    "content": "Hey all, Referring to concerns brought by @g_dip regarding the box parameter used in Liquidations 1.2 and his discussion with some of the keepers in the ecosystem, they advised to decrease the box value from 30m to 15m. Lower number means that auctions clear more efficiently (lower probability of low bids), but we risk additional price volatility for potentially postponed auctions due to market conditions. However vaults having postponed auctions could unwind in the meantime, which means that setting box conservatively can still lead to certain positive outcomes. On the other hand if we are concerned about the box being too high currently (keepers don\u2019t have enough capital) we would normally hope for people from the DeFi ecosystem to bid on auctions using for instance UI from DeFi Saver. Another idea that was raised in chat rooms was to mitigate potentially lower box with lower ttl (reducing auction bid duration from 6 hours to 3 hours). This means that 30m auctions, despite having a box of 15m, would still be cleared within 6 hours and would hence reduce price volatility exposure. However 3 hours might not be long enough for all keepers to react, relative to geographic location of their operations. Pros for lower box:  More participants per auction, higher bids Vaults still have time to unwind before liquidated  Cons for lower box:  Price volatility exposure for non-liquidated vaults that get liquidated in next batch Even if are overestimating keepers\u2019 reserves currently, we might be underestimating liquidity that could come to auctions from other users using DeFi Saver liquidation service  Pros for lower ttl combined with lower box:  More balanced effect of increased price exposure concerns and faster clearing of auctions  Cons for lower ttl combined with lower box:  3 hour bid auction duration might not be enough for all keepers to react      Decrease box to 15m and leave ttl at 6 hours Decrease box to 15m and decrease ttl to 3 hours Keep box at 30m and ttl at 6 hours.

                    "content": "Thank you for putting this up, @Primoz. I would like to give some clarity on why I am voting for \u201cDecrease box to 15m and leave ttl at 6 hours.\u201d (1) 30m (current setting) likely exceeds the current Keeper ecosystem\u2019s available liquidity. Over the weekend we saw two WBTC vaults with a cumulative 50m Dai in debt come within 5% of liquidation. Should his have happened, 30m Dai would have been required to bid on the first set of auctions. This means that within 7 hours (1hr OSM delay + 6hr auction ttl), the Keepers would need to source this capital in either Dai or USDC (to use the USDC-A and B facilities). Based on my conversations with participants in this group, they would not have these funds readily available in this timeline. A lack of Dai liquidity can potentially result in 0 bids if more Keepers are not able to quickly join the ecosystem or the existing Keepers able to source emergency credit lines. Either way, this is not an enviable position. Therefore I am voting to decrease box to 15m, which I believe to be within the current Keeper ecosystem\u2019s available liquidity. I should note that this would be a temporary change, as liquidations 2.0 should remove the need for this kind of cap. As Primoz pointed out, the downside to this decision is that bad debt can sit in the system for a longer period of time. (2) I believe the current ttl of 6 hours should remain the same. The downside to cutting it in half, is that we risk a technical issue (or even sleep schedules) resulting in 0 bids. For example, if Keeper X represents 30% of the liquidity, and they are knocked offline for whatever reason, that extra 3 hours could be the difference between the collateral clearing at the correct price or 30% lower than it should have. I do not think that pushing the potential clearing time of bad debt by 1 hour (one OSM update) is such a large risk that we should reduce the Keeper\u2019s time to source funds and bid - I believe the latter to be the greater risk. If the community believes that the reduction in box needs a reduction in ttl, I think 5 hours (which mitigates the additional one hour) rather than 3. ",

There is a ton of DAI liquidity out there, as you can see by all the yield farming operations. Currently, there\u2019s 80m DAI providing DAI/ETH liquidity to farm Sushi. With public awareness, we can get people to bid on Maker auctions to buy collateral at a discount. A 15m Box doesn\u2019t seem sufficient considering our current DAI debt size. There is a lot of additional risk when the box gets filled. People will be able to max out vaults and not get liquidated. They can choose whether they want to save their vault later. It also means, that the auctions that are getting auctioned later, may have a smaller safety buffer for liquidation. And a smaller safety buffer has a much higher chance for auctions to lose money. The current issue is between capital constraints, and the increased risk with a lower Box size. A 15m Box size doesn\u2019t seem sufficient, it adds more risk. Capital constraints risks may be overblown. ",

I agree with everything you said about the risks of setting the box too low, but I disagree with this one last statement.  I think keeper capital risk mixed with having the box set too large puts us in a similar situation as Black Thursday.  Specifically, I think the risks you articulated from the box being set too low are a better set of risks than if the box is set too high. In the former scenario, the price drops below the protocols ability to return capital to the Vault holder and the protocol takes on bad debt; however, when the liquidation happens we get a competitive bid on the collateral.  The bonus here is that Vault holders get a chance to save their Vaults, and we are more resilient against the more likely occurrence of a flash crash and recovery, as opposed to a permanent collateral crash.  Meanwhile, the protocol takes on bad debt, but that bad debt value isn\u2019t the entire position as in the case of 1 wei bids.  This could happen if a collateral instantly goes to 0, but I can imagine no auction scenario that mitigates this risk. In the latter scenario, keepers cannot muster the capital in the six hour window and we see bids far below market prices, possibly 1 wei bids again.  This means the Vault holder loses everything, and the protocol takes on all that bad debt for a large recapitalization with MKR.  This is the Black Thursday scenario, and it\u2019s a far more likely risk with disastrous consequences. I\u2019m interested in any counter-arguments to my conjecture that risk of box too low < risk of box too high. ",

Having not balanced all of these risks personally, I would say 6 hours ttl is a good default.  I would not start fiddling with ttl without doing a thorough risk assessment on the risks above and any others we can think of. P.S. To give everyone an idea of network congestion on Black Thursday.  I was paying 2x+ gas price, and it could only execute 0.7 transactions a minute.  So applying this to auctions for a single address, that\u2019s (.7 tx a minute) * (60 minutes in an hour) * (6 hours) = 252 transactions for a single address.  For auctions on BT, I think there were 4000+ auctions with each taking minimally kick(), tend(), dent(), and deal() so the keeper can recycle capital.  For competitive auctions, that\u2019s a lot more transactions.  Even if the solution is to go wide with many addresses or web3 users, how much does the gas block size rate-limit liquidations?  How much now that DeFi is exploding with many other protocols where users are competing for that space?  I\u2019ll be working on LIQ-2.0 if you need me. ",
