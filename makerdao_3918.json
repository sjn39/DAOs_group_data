                    "content": "Hey everyone, the Content CU is going to be conducting interviews to gain insight into MakerDAO\u2019s brand and we need YOUR help to collect the data.  A brand is an expression of why a person or organization does the things they do. In general, people have an easier time relating to others when they talk about why they do what they do rather than what they specifically do. To gain insight into MakerDAO\u2019s brand, we\u2019re inviting community members to schedule a 15-30 minute call where we can learn about why MakerDAO matters to you. Responses may be kept private but the data collected will be anonymized and aggregated to share with the community. If permission is given, responses will also be used to create marketing materials for the DAO.  Why do brand research? Discussions about what our brand is often end up in a stalemate over topics like whether or not it\u2019s appropriate to characterize MakerDAO as a bank. Rather than attempt to facilitate another one of these discussions, we believe the best way to gain insight into our brand is to ask community members individually: why does MakerDAO matter? By giving us an understanding of who you are, how you use MakerDAO, and how MakerDAO fits into the DeFi ecosystem, our team can produce more effective content and provide helpful insights Core Units and community members can use to grow the MakerDAO ecosystem.  Goals  Obtain info about perceptions of why MakerDAO matters Collect content to aggregate into various types of output Share the human side of MakerDAO with the wider community Gather interesting stories about peoples experience finding and joining the MakerDAO community. Strengthen the MakerDAO brand by clarifying what the people who work for MakerDAO care about   How to participate Schedule a call with a team member today! If you\u2019re uncomfortable being recorded, we can make accommodations. Your thoughts and opinions are valuable for our purposes whether recorded or not. Want to follow up? We\u2019d love to! Our doors are always open and all sharing is helpful. If you have concerns or questions please leave a comment or feel free to DM myself, @seth, or @alec. ",
