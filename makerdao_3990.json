Context: I\u2019m trying to get a better sense how decentralized the overall Ethereum ecosystem has become, given (in my opinion) it was not decentralized at all 3-4 years ago. E.g., we probably all know that fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC/USDT have centrally controlled burn/freeze/mint functions that are frequently triggered, basically whenever a government comes knocking. And to give another example, my understanding is that still today, even the \u201cTier 1\u201d token-based index funds could be drained by a group of 2-4 multisig signers. So, how would I define a centralized element? I\u2019d say: some characteristic of the system that leads to a small number of anonymous actors (let\u2019s say <40 entities) and/or an even smaller number of known actors (real world identities known) being able to influence the protocol in a way that impacts the community, or single members of the community, in a negative way. This would include freezing funds, burning funds, stealing/seizing funds, etc. Basically, how many people would have to collude to do something bad to someone else\u2019s tokens? Or to use a different scenario, how many people would have to be de-anon\u2019d and threatened/coerced? (This is how I define decentralization \u2026 censorship resistance.) ",

Excellent, I love that we think alike. Don\u2019t worry, you can collaborate little by little, sharing your opinions or what you think about a certain topic, we are all relatively new to this, and each option is worth the same. You can learn from maker here, by reading every thread you like or in the search engine, or by asking specific questions in the threads that pertain to a certain topic. If you want to learn about maker I recommend you to search on youtube as well and if you speak spanish the DAI Venezuela posts on medium. ",
