Summary: Alongside @christiancdpetersen, @eumenes spent 1202.5 hours (7.21 months) and @teej spent 1833 hours (11 months) onboarding, negotiating, and structuring Real World Assets for MakerDAO. Their relationship with the DAO was one of passion and constant consideration - each sought to build a high-quality RWA platform for Maker. Weekends were spent, pre-greenlit and post-greenlit MIP6 applications reviewed and communicated on, thought essays were written, office hours maintained, and educational campaigns were conducted. One might argue that the campaign, capped by the successful onboarding of HVB and SocGen, was fairly successful. Given the unjustifiable and rapid nature of their departure from Maker, @eumenes and @teej believe that a social contract has been violated between the DAO and two of its contributors. They therefore humbly request the community\u2019s understanding of their desire to build a lasting governance relationship with the DAO, and are supportive of them receiving a pro-rata share of the 1-year vesting MKR for RWF-001 FTEs, or 80 MKR. The vesting of MKR justly compensates contributors for their time and sets a precedent for acknowledging meaningful contributions to the DAO. This consistency is important to continuing to attract high-tier talent to Maker. We humbly ask the community\u2019s understanding and approval. Proposed Actions: We are seeking approval for this pro-rata distribution of MKR tokens. This approval will serve as an indication to GovAlpha/RWF-001 Facilitator to proceed with the necessary spells for the distribution of 73.32 MKR to @teej\u2019s ethereum wallet and of 48.1 MKR to @eumenes ethereum wallet.  Poll    Do you support the above proposed actions?  Yes - Release 73.32 MKR to Teej and 48.1 MKR to Eric No - Do not release Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This poll will run until 2022-09-02T22:30:00Z. If more than 50% of the non-abstaining votes are in favor then this proposal will move to an onchain vote on September 5th. From there, if passed it would be bundled for an executive vote as scheduling allows. ",

This Signal Request gauges community sentiment towards compensating previous RWF-001 Core Unit Members @eumenes and @teej with MKR, prorated for time spent as FTEs. The total compensation amounts to 121.42 MKR, allocated as follows:  73.32 MKR to @teej. 48.10 MRK to @eumenes.   Some confusion has been expressed by the community with regards to what the next steps are upon the passing of this Signal Request. They have now been clarified in the original post. Furthermore, the Signal Request will now (08/23/2022) be extended by seven days until Friday, September 2 to ensure that those who have already cast their vote can change it in light of the clarification. If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes are in favor of this proposal, it will go on-chain as a poll on September 5th, as now clarified in the Signal Request. Specifically, the passing of this Signal Request will result in RWF-001\u2019s Facilitator @williamr requesting 121.42 MKR as communicated in this forum post via a on-chain poll, followed by an executive vote upon the poll\u2019s ratification. This Signal Request will run until Friday, September 2, as stated above. This SR has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  ",

To what degree you guys do or don\u2019t bear any responsibility for that is not my place to judge, but\u2026 if there is any, it\u2019s best to start there before asking for things like prorated vests.

There are clear divisions within the community that have a personal stake in seeing such a SR succeed, and thus it has the potential to cause further division within the MakerDAO community. MakerDAO is a decentralized organization where core units enjoy a tremendous amount of freedom and autonomy. Within this autonomy lies the authority to compose and manage their team as the core unit leaders see fit. This means any changes to a team\u2019s composition \u2013 and the consequences of such changes \u2013 are the responsibility of the facilitator of that core unit. Any deviation from this represents an extraordinary ask of the community and of MKR holders, as well as a deviation from policy, tradition, and common sense I recognize the tremendous work done by @christiancdpetersen, @eumenes, and @teej. In terms of time commitment, but also in the way of results. Honouring commitments is one of my core values, and compensation for performed work is to me an cornerstone of my position. I am also impressed by the work ethic shown in the aftermath of the terminations. On the other hand, standing by the original agreements is also honouring commitments. Allowing a pro-rata compensation of MKR prior to the cliff diminishes the value of the cliff, and represents an improvement for @teej and @eumenes versus simply carrying the vesting to a different CU (assuming there is a CU willing to hire them). I can sympathize by arguing that the departure was \"unjustifiable\u201d but having received information to the contrary, it is hard for me to accept that the social contract between Maker and the contributors have not also been violated by the actions of the contributors. My preferred solution would be for the contributors to continue their work with the transfer of their original vesting and cliff. Assuming they can continue to deliver quality work and avoid any further departures, that vesting MKR should mature and provide the previously agreed upon compensation while also allowing governance to remain consistent in its stance.

                    "content": "cc\u2019ing @Llama as delegate I agree with @JustinCase and others here in saying that this Signal has several issues on process rather than substance. Substance is relatively straightforward. @Eumenes and @teej have been incredible contributors and they deserve their $MKR compensation component as much as anyone who is still employed. This is my opinion of course. Process is cumbersome. The MIP40 is clear in defining a cliff, and it would be far from ideal to provide an overriding decision, opening a precedent for other, often less visible, CU members. It is even more cumbersome to ask @williamr as Facilitator to provide the case for it, give that he was the one handing over the termination letter before the cliff date. I believe it would be more appropriate for the community to solve the issues at the origin, i.e. by amending the MIP40. If I am not mistaken, @GovAlpha-Core-Unit has in its MIP some language to allow good leavers to keep the matured-yet-not-fully-vested MKR component. Obviously correct me if I am wrong here - quote below.    MIP40c3-SP80: Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget - Q3 2022   Note that a primary difference in our incentive model is that contributors retain the right to their MKR vesting even after leaving the Core Unit. This is to ensure a smooth transition. Only in the event of an ethical breach or failure to transition will a contributor lose their claim on their MKR vesting.   I agree with GOV-001\u2019s wording, since the point is that vesting has been traditionally designed as a retention tool rather than a threatening tool. If that wasn\u2019t the case, the employer would have immense power around the cliff date. And this should not happen. It is my opinion that people who are removed by the facilitator as good leavers should keep their matured yet not fully vested MKR component. The initial cliff is a sub-set of this, but I believe it falls into the same category. This is typical of most employment contracts I have seen. I believe it is the case that the Facilitator has removed the staff as bad leavers, given the noise generated on forum. The discussion, in other words, should rather be with @williamr to hear the motives for such a strong move, and act on this Signal accordingly - if and only if the situation requires a very specific action. Ultimately, however, I would try to amend the wording of the MIP40s for future use. ",

Sorry for any confusion here, this took a moment to sort out between stakeholders. We have edited the poll and added our summary of its effects to hopefully clear up any resulting misconceptions. Generally speaking, signals do have to go onchain for them to have any effect, but the interactions between CU Facilitators and their team have a high degree of autonomy. We hope that by clarifying this proposal is set to go through governance on its own, it will help alleviate any lasting social tensions on the DAO side while allowing MKR Holders to give the final say on the matter.     flipflopflapdelegate:  @GovAlpha-Core-Unit can anybody from Gov Alpha clarify how you are communicating to the vast community that this SR was changed from a \u201csentiment\u201d poll (that\u2019s how I understood it originally) to now going Live in an Executive Vote? And how you\u2019re guaranteeing MKR token owners, Delegates, and Maker Community members understand what they are Polling/Signaling for?   The confusion here seemed to be coming from the implication that this would go straight to an executive vote. Like with all other signals we must emphasize that is not the case. This situation was perhaps a little unique in that @williamr has both the autonomy to compensate his CU and the ability to move an item through Governance faster. I was approached by both Will and @teej about this situation, and I think figuring out a consensus way to bring this to governance resulted in some confusing wording. In addition to all the other things we do for signals, we\u2019ll be highlighting this issue on tomorrow\u2019s G&R to make sure voters understand the implication of their votes. Given the confusion, we extended the voting period for this signal by a week to ensure everyone has time to update their vote if need be. If more than 50% of non-abstaining voters support this signal, it will move onchain on September 5th when voters and delegates can give the go/no go for an executive.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Also, please provide an example as to when this has previously happen. As an example, did the one-time MKR compensation request for LongForWisdom, and/or Primoz \u2014 did that go straight to an Executive Vote? In Primoz case, it was Bundle in the Risk Core Unit Compensation POLL, followed by an Executive. ON-CHAIN POLL and Forum Post   Don\u2019t think it would be fair to say there are any other examples of this type of proposal. This is why a signal was ultimately recommended as the best course of action. Generally, a MIP would be the best place to propose MKR compensation. But this is a situation where RWF already has a passed MIP allocating the team MKR. The dispute at question is if @teej and @Eumenes should receive any MKR. On @williamr\u2019s side is that they were terminated before their cliff date, but the cliff date had nothing to do with the termination. As a result, we have this signal asking the community if an exception should be made.  Couple asides:   We note @flipflopflapdelegate\u2019s point that this hasn\u2019t been a very clean governance process. We have had some internal struggles with the Signal process, as quite frequently there will be issues with how a Signal Request is initially presented. On slow weeks, no problem, we can address them before too many people vote. But when issues like this one come up, that spur a lot of debate and discussion before GovAlpha can make sure everyone is on the same page, it leads to confusion and frustration for most stakeholders. The one main option we have to fix this has been a lever we\u2019re reluctant to flip. We could \u201cgate\u201d the signal category (like we do with the Delegates category) so that any incoming post must be approved. But that gives moderators the chance to censor signals and makes the Governance process more centralized. This power is particularly worrying when you consider that future signals might wish to punish or restrict the powers of GovAlpha. When Patrick is back I\u2019ll see if we can organize a call on the subject because we agree that this is a problem, but aren\u2019t sure the solution improves the status quo.   This hasn\u2019t been a fun one for me personally. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been too shy about pointing out the lack of an HR department at Maker. As a result, issues like this come to me and it creates a particularly dangerous set up for contributors.  This is not the first (and certainly won\u2019t be the last) time someone comes to a Governance Facilitator to say \u201cI think I was wronged, what do I do?\u201d While the Governance nerd in me never shies away from thinking about how I would propose something, I think it\u2019s particularly important to acknowledge that I am not the advocate workers need in these situations. My neutrality mandate means I have to be indifferent to how the proposal is voted. This particular situation highlights the absurdity well as both @williamr and @teej were messaging me for advice on how to proceed. While that can already get sticky, it\u2019s even more stressful when there\u2019s controversy about the proposed course of action and the resolution involves making a decision that harms one side more than the other. I am happy to be trusted to make good value judgments in these situations but feel the need to draw attention to this issue as I am a servant of the DAO. Contributors need someone they can turn to with their best interests at heart when there is conflict.   ",

I just mention this aside here because you raise a global issue that\u2019s playing out painfully in many areas. Not sure what it\u2019s going to take for the real powers that be here to understand these dynamics and the necessity for a different operating and accountability structure for an organization of this size and complexity, ",

This is not the first (and certainly won\u2019t be the last) time someone comes to a Governance Facilitator to say \u201cI think I was wronged, what do I do?\u201d   I fully understand the frustration felt by prose in this situation. There was a proposal to onboard an HR function but facilitators were reluctant to commit to it and thus it was voted down. Situations like these serve to highlight why some of the traditional support functions we find in other organizations exists. Core Units enjoy a tremendous amount of autonomy. That autonomy is largely centered on the facilitator. That means that contributors, to a large extent, have to put their faith and trust in their facilitator. If a facilitator decides to let someone go, that is fully within a facilitators powers. With the way we are currently organized, the one contributors need to address their grievances to is their facilitator. Obviously this becomes impossible when the conflict is with the facilitator in question. This is the system as it is designed. The alternative is a more centralized system with accountability in a chain of command. The price of such a system is less autonomy and less flexibility for the core units. With the way we are currently organized, the one contributors need to address their grievances to is their facilitator. Obviously this becomes impossible when the conflict is with the facilitator in question. Delegates answers to their delegators which is the MKR holders. That means that first and foremost delegates have MKR holders interests at heart. The interest of MKR holders and contributors can certainly be aligned, but this is not always the case. There is also the problem that if delegates supports contributors over facilitators it weakens the autonomy of the core units. In essence, facilitators are at the mercy of MKR holders the same way that contributors are at the mercy of their facilitators. My concern with the current organization is that it has the potential to create a work environment that is hostile and unpredictable enough that we will struggle to attract the right contributors. Engaging governance on a case by case basis does turn MKR holders into managers so that doesn\u2019t seem like a  very optimal solution either. Using this proposal as an example, approving it would create a precedent so from now on it should be assumed that anyone being let go will seek to get partial MKR compensation prior to the cliff being reached. Where would one draw the line between those receiving partial compensation and those who do not? It would weaken the concept of a cliff to the detriment of MKR holders. ",

But I get it. Folks want to be compensated for their work, and future generations are irrelevant when one wants to get paid.   Was hoping to avoid this feeling, so I appreciate you noting that we still have improvements to make. On my end, while the wording in next steps could have made this sound like a sentiment poll, it was posted in the signal category and followed the other rules for a signal. The confusion came in how the result would be processed, which I take full responsibility for as @teej was drafting this while I was checking with @williamr as to what he would like to do. As mentioned above, Will does have power to request and dispense his requested MKR allocation so this matter could have been resolved without oncahin polling. Ultimately, Will wanted to know whether the MKR holders would support this exception and that can only be done if brought onchain.  Decision Not to Restart the Poll This was particularly thorny because of the initial resolution time posted on the signal. We tend to recommend signals be posted for 2 weeks for this very reason. With that being said, it\u2019s not hard to imagine why disputes over this sum of capital might want to be settled quickly. So in my mind I could either restart the voting and insist on 2 weeks lead time, or extend the signal one week and make these clarifications. I chose to extend and make sure the issue is highlighted on our weekly call because while the process might make a difference to voters (like you are indicating Frank), the question itself of \u201cshould we allocate the MKR\u201d is not impacted by asking the question again onchain. Anyone voting for the execution does not have reason to change votes, only those that object to either the initial implied procedure or the clarified one. Restarting the vote has the cost of potentially losing some intention participation + the chance that people revote their old opinion without considering the changes. To me that about equaled the cost of the potential for previous voters to not have seen the clarification. So the tipping point was respecting the proposal author\u2019s timeline as much as possible, especially given that there was plenty of run up about this issue before the signal itself. ",

In any other organization that would be the end of the story.   I get this. I would say the difference for me in this case is that the facilitator went kind of rogue - breaching duty of care responsibilities that I assume would be stated in the mandate (should be) or anyway would be an implied obligation of stewardship for the Facilitator role. Actions taken and their method were reckless and harmful to the DAO in that the Facilitator failed to communicate fully, transparently and timely regarding all relevant matters, had no contingency plan and left all of us scrambling to pick up the pieces - which I might add the folks who were terminated did a lion share of AFTER the fact thus preserving extremely important relationships and transaction executions for the entire DAO. So, this is an extraordinary situation. We as a whole community are still waiting, by the way, on what\u2019s happening wrt the RWF CU that doesn\u2019t seem to have any staff and some report the official RWF CU is engaging/responding to some stakeholders/applicants/partners and not others. I can\u2019t work out what all is going on. I am sure I don\u2019t have the best information. I attended the office hours @williamr hosted last week and it brought me no clarity whatsoever. Not sure I understand exactly what the mechanics are here, but ACREinvest sentiment is staying yes on whatever needs to happen for MKR comp to be awarded. ~ Kianga ",

On @williamr\u2019s side is that they were terminated before their cliff date, but the cliff date had nothing to do with the termination.   I think we\u2019re making this way bigger than it actually is. The signal is about enquiring whether MKR accumulated during the period of contribution should be released before cliff or not. Other than that contributors are free to request the MKR they believe is due. And even work with governance on a spell to deliver that MKR to them. I\u2019ve already said, but I\u2019ll repeat. The MKR is delivered, when a spell is executed, to the auditor multisig. In theory, and in practice, contributors can get their MKR from there. I am not a signer of the auditor multisig. The contracts with the former contributors terminated effectively on 3 August 2022. ",

We all worked alongside one another. After we asked the facilitator to step down, he suggested a split/spin-out of the core unit. We made a proposal to do just that and were all terminated on the same morning. Given the odd nature of this severance, we\u2019re asking for an exception to be made to the strict 1-year cliff for vesting MKR. Simply put: due to a peculiar sequence of events, contributors left 6 weeks prior to their vest. As a matter of decency, we are asking for token holders and community members to support us. Thanks and have a good weekend! ",

As uncomfortable as it is, the DAO must recognize that the problem Will Remor has created has left the domain of crypto and has entered the domain of human interaction. There are likely several reasons why we will be left waiting for an update on new RWA-001 team members:  How can Will Remor recruit new team members, when any potential contractor can read the forum and see how poorly this situation has been handled by Will Remor to date? Ironically, RWA candidates are probably quite good at doing their own due diligence on a firm/company/DAO before joining it. What individual wants to work in a contractor capacity for a leader who fires their entire team without warning after they propose their own spin out and a pro-rata headcount split of expenses (preserving the livelihood of the CU leader)? What individual can accept the risk of working for a leader that views them as \u201cservice providers. Period.\u201d rather than human beings? [1] While my personal opinion is that callous, free-market interactions can exist between businesses, I do not believe this meta works in the long term when hiring individuals. It is not a stable equilibrium that supports continued recruitment, personal development, personal growth, etc.  In a sense, the centralization and secrecy of traditional firms hide the true nature of leaders like Will Remor, allowing them to hire new, poor fools, oblivious to the true management style of the leader. DAOs\u2013stripped bare for the entire world to see\u2013are a different beast! Will Remor is combat ineffective\u2013unable to lead his troops and unable to repair morale. For the sake of the protocol, we must put this drama behind us.  [1]    MIP40c3-SP78: RWF-0x Budget Proposal through 2022   Independent contractors were service providers. Period.   ",

I am preparing to propose offboarding the RWF core unit. I also intend to vote against the RWF-0x core unit, and for the most part have been making preparations for an almost complete reboot of RWA work in Maker (with a few key contributors that have been involved in RWA providing continuity). This is aligned with preparations for the Endgame Plan votes that will go to RFC in September and to vote in October, where the day to day RWA work and direct relationships will be rearranged around the \u201cProtector Clusters\u201d and be a responsibility that resides with those who will eventually set up the RWA focused MetaDAOs. I am planning more offboarding proposals and budget cuts beyond this, but they have been carefully prepared to avoid removing critical resources or damage our ability to do the things we need to do, and because it is such a balancing act that must also be carefully communicated, it still needs final optimizations and improvements. Once that\u2019s in place it will all be communicated ASAP. It is in order to minimize the window time with confusion and uncertainty that I have aimed to communicate everything as close together as possible. I\u2019m also going to vote for the MKR compensation of Eric and Teej, we will find a way to get it on-chain one way or another. I believe that everyone that leaves who worked for the project in good faith should receive fair rewards. This is both based on principle, but also because it is going to make the coming transition to a lower budget a lot smoother, resulting in much greater savings overall. ",

Do good work and get paid, simple. I can\u2019t see a situation in which these two jump to another team to pick up the stream, which is also preferred. Agree with @JustinCase and @brianmcmichael that the unraveling here is simply tough/terrible luck. That has happened to me personally a couple of times (even within Maker 's different identities). It sucks. While taking my sweet time, I asked myself these questions:  If it was 10 MKR would you even care? \u2190 probably not. What motivated reasoning am I evaluating this on? \u2190 status quo bias of \u201cwe should stop evaluating ad hoc requests.\u201d  Hence, I\u2019m voting no and I dislike that conclusion. Would prefer a different approach. ",
