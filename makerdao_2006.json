                    "content": "There have been a lot of revisions to the endgame Tokenomics since the early days of singularity elixir. With the potential renaming of MetaDAOs to SubDAO we may also once again need a new name for the tokenomics, and for now I will simply refer to the system as the Endgame Tokenomics (which is probably the simplest and most straightforward name). In this post I will provide the basic numbers and features of the latest and likely final iteration of the tokenomics. The main change is the removal of all token selling mechanics for simplicity and better regulatory standing. This results in the removal of the Anti-Reflexivity Mechanic, the removal of the drizzle engine for SubDAOs and delay of the drizzle engine for Maker Core. In return there is additional complexity in the MKR emissions for the Core SubDAO Tokenomics to ensure there is still anti-reflexivity features in place.  Tokenomics breakdown Total yearly emissions: 70000 MKR Of this 70000:  60000 MKR goes to the Core SubDAO Tokenomics (explained further below) 5000 MKR goes to the SubDAO incubation account (to provide seed funding for future SubDAOs) 3000 goes to the workforce bonus pool 2000 goes to the purpose charity fund   Core SubDAO Tokenomics mechanics The Core SubDAO Tokenomics (also referred to as Core Metanomics or Elixir Wars) is the main mechanism of financial gamification of the Endgame Plan, that drive most of the value flows that altogether produce a stable economic equilibrium. The 60000 MKR is transferred from Maker Core to the SubDAOs, and split between them based on the relative accumulated Elixir of each SubDAO. However, there is an upper limit - a SubDAO cannot receive more than 10000 MKR per year, regardless of how much elixir it has. As the freshly emitted MKR is transferred to the SubDAO, one of two things happens with it, based on the price of the SubDAO tokens and a SubDAO valuation model. The SubDAO valuation model is maintained by the Finance Scope in the Finance Scope Framework, and tries to balance being accurate with being simple in providing a conservative traditional fundamental analysis of the cash flows and some balance sheet assets of the SubDAO, while ignoring the cash flows of the tokenomics itself. So basically it tries to value the SubDAO as if it was a normal business rather than a gamified DAO construct. The valuation model is compared with all circulating SubDAO Tokens. The two billion tokens that are distributed through genesis farming are considered circulating for this purpose (may need adjustment)  Option 1: SubDAO Tokens are undervalued (SDT market cap < valuation model) If the SubDAO Tokens are undervalued the MKR tokens received are used to accumulate SubElixir (meta elixir), which are LP tokens that consist of SubDAO Tokens and MKR at a 50/50 ratio. This helps provide more liquidity for the SubDAO tokens which is beneficial when the token is undervalued.  Option 2: SubDAO Tokens are overvalued (SDT market cap > valuation model) If the SubDAO Tokens are overvalued it would be wasteful to provide more liquidity for them. Instead, the MKR received is used to accumulate Elixir for the SubDAOs Elixir Reserve. This both provides long term fundamental value for the SubDAO as the Elixir can be used as collateral and junior capital, and also increases the valuation model since it takes Elixir Reserves into account, making it more likely that the SubDAO will flip to being undervalued and have the MKR inflow begin to accumulate SubElixir. Basically, if the SubDAOs has good fundamentals but struggle with price, the tokenomics help support strong market liquidity for the SubDAO token. If the SubDAO has a strong price but struggles with fundamental value, then Maker helps provide more fundamental value and refrains from directly impacting the already overvalued price. This all in all results in a Tokenomics system that allows the SubDAO tokens to be heavily farmed and dumped without losing all their liquidity, while preventing bubbles forming from reflexive Tokenomics due to the inbuilt \u201ceconomic brake\u201d that the valuation model provides ",

                    "content": "No, burn continues to exist but, it is a \u201csmart burn\u201d based on a valuation model so we can avoid wasting money on burning when the MKR price is high (such as what happened during last bull market). Income is used to accumulate elixir (MKR/ETH/DAI LP tokens), and the total pool of elixir is used to burn at a rate determined by deviation from the valuation target. So a simplified example could be that monthly burn of the total elixir pool is equivalent to the deviation from the valuation target. So if the valuation target is 1 billion (based on measured assets and cash flow), and MKR is trading at a market cap of 800 million, then each month 20% of all the accumulated elixir is used for buy and burn. This way the protocol will always accumulate assets with all of its surplus income (and also buy MKR at all times, for the 1/3 portion of elixir that is MKR), but then use those assets to maximize the potential for burn in times when the MKR price is low. This also helps stabilize the MKR price and protect against massive drops and loss of confidence in potential MKR dilution events. The emissive part of the tokenomics helps offset the effect of the burn on the MKR distribution, so we avoid getting an increasingly concentrated base of holders as tokens are burned over time, but instead achieve an equilibrium with dynamic circulation where an equivalent amount of MKR is burned and emitted each year. The value drivers for MKR will be the burn, the SubDAO token yield available for active voters, and the ability to generate Dai at high collateralization ratios and low rates available for active voters.

As that seems to be the main engine of the new tokenomics. Recently Vitalik also gave a blog post on some of his vision for what DAOs (MakerDAO gets a mention) can be in the future, and how governance and tokenomics can work, maybe it can give some insights and inspiration as well as we prepare for the endgame plan. What in the Ethereum application ecosystem excites me Blog Post  At the time of this writing, MakerDAO has $7.8 billion in collateral, over 17x the market cap of the profit-taking token, MKR. Hence, if governance was up to MKR holders with no safeguards, someone could buy up half the MKR, use that to manipulate the price oracles, and steal a large portion of the collateral for themselves. In fact, this actually happened with a smaller stablecoin! It hasn\u2019t happened to MKR yet largely because the MKR holdings are still fairly concentrated, with the majority of the MKR held by a fairly small group that would not be willing to sell because they believe in the project. This is a fine model to get a stablecoin started, but not a good one for the long term. Hence, making decentralized stablecoins work long term requires innovating in decentralized governance that does not have these kinds of flaws. Two possible directions include:  Some kind of non-financialized governance, or perhaps a bicameral hybrid where decisions need to be passed not just by token holders but also by some other class of user (eg. the Optimism Citizens\u2019 House or stETH holders as in the Lido two-chamber proposal)  Intentional friction, making it so that certain kinds of decisions can only take effect after a delay long enough that users can see that something is going wrong and escape the system.

This also helps stabilize the MKR price and protect against massive drops and loss of confidence in potential MKR dilution events.   One interesting possibility of this plan is the application of algorithms for setting capital allocation. Today this function is only performed using MKR burn, but this method can be quite rough to achieve such a complicated task. Additionally, it can fail when MKR is overvalued and can consume a large amount of capital. A possible way to avoid subjectivity and a forward-looking valuation function, is to use relative valuation terms, which are objective and based on the present. You could also source all this data with an on-chain oracle and run the contract with a keeper. For example, if the price of MKR in DAI is lower than the DAI value of the surplus buffer per token or some multiple of it, the surplus buffer can be burned until the DAI value of the surplus buffer per token is normalized relative to the price of the token in DAI. Another option is to allow for MKR token redemptions at the net asset value, as an alternative or in addition to burning. If the price of MKR in DAI is higher than the trailing n-block average surplus buffer accumulation rate per token, MKR can be minted and sold. The proceeds of this sale could be invested in operations or in ether or liquid staked derivatives of it. The formulas proposed here could probably be improved, but the goal is to rely on instantaneous relative valuation metrics (rather than absolute or forward) to answer two capital allocation questions: 1) Is it better to invest DAI within MKR or let MKR holders invest elsewhere? 2) To fund operations or invest in a proprietary protocol fund, is it better to wait for normal operations to generate DAI or is it faster to sell new MKR?
