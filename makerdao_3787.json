                    "content": "Over the last couple of weeks, there have been some discussions in the community around the topic of the marketing of Maker. Marcomms had their initial proposal rejected and is currently revising. The community has also received a Marketing CU proposal from Amazix. Instead of looking at the proposals in detail, let us map out what marketing of Maker means.  Marketing Maker (3)960\u00d7540 51.2 KB  Due to the multifaceted nature of Maker there is more than one single thing or product to market. There are: DAI - the stablecoin. Possibly expanded to multiple currency variants. Vaults - without risk takers willing to open Vaults there can be no DAI. MKR - the governance token. Oracles - a critical component and possible secondary source of income for Maker. The Maker Community - the pool of all human elements in the ecosystem. All of the above components must function and succeed for further growth. If you doubt this try the mental exercise of taking one of the above components and letting it fade to zero while you are trying to picture Maker as a success. You quickly find that this is impossible - all must flourish for Maker to succeed. This multifaceted nature of Maker does however mean that marketing all of Maker means taking on multiple big jobs at once - the task of marketing Maker Vaults to risk-seeking high net worth individuals is very different from marketing Oracles to real-world-asset originators or MKR to VC firms. Or Dai to small fish DeFi degens. All of the above can have different value propositions, different target groups, different methods of reaching these groups, and different ways in which success is measured. The Oracles CU has already taken this into account by including the marketing of Oracles in their Core Unit proposal. Splitting up the task of marketing could additionally allow for more specialization and higher productivity as well as lower risk for Maker with regards to Core Unit onboarding. The proposed Data Insight CU could be a valuable tool for providing clues about where the most gains could be made. Instead of textwalling, let us see if we can signal our way forward.    Do you roughly agree with the above analysis of Maker\u2019s marketing situation?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Should Maker\u2019s marketing change from being Dai-centric (or whatever it was during the Foundation Age) to being multi-faceted?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Should CUs involved in marketing be encouraged to specialize their efforts?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Do you agree that for marketing purposes onboarding smaller, specialized CU\u2019s is easier compared to larger, more generalized CU\u2019s?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        Should the idea of a generalized Marketing CU be abandoned in favor of smaller, more focussed efforts?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Polls will run for a week.

What is particularly frustrating about both Amazix and the Marcomms proposals is that they both fail to see that the immediate problem that Maker is facing is NOT a problem of DAI adoption. We have way too much demand and not enough supply so any effort right now should be targeted towards vault owners and getting them to mint more DAI. Instead, the proposals so far have all been about DAI advertising, branding etc. which is actually gonna exacerbate our current peg problems. I am not sure what the right marketing framework should be e.g. specialized efforts by CUs or a more general Marketing CU. I can see arguments for both. There is also the \u201care we onboarding too many CUs?\u201d question which I think is legitimate. ",

                    "content": "Thanks @Planet_X for this much-needed discussion. After reading a lot in the forum and having talks with community participants, I am going to put here some of the thoughts that I have gathered over the years working for the Maker Foundation and now for the Growth Core Unit. The idea is to know if the community thinks the same and to see how we can jointly propose certain directions to take, and the good thing about this post is that it helps us to define the product subdivisions because to have a strategy, you have to have well defined the limits and scope of that / those products. In addition to what has been said, The difficulty of \u201cmarketing Dai\u201d consists in pushing a \u201cyet to be defined\u201d product that does not have a clear \u201cjob to be done\u201d, for example\u2026 What is the main MakerDAO product for you?  Credits / vaults? Stablecoin for Payments? Stablecoin for Investments/farming? Stablecoin for RWA? Transparency and Decentralization? Other\u2026  As @planet_x said in this post, this is a key question because depending on the answer, we will have a long set of tasks/issues to solve before going out and compete in the world. These issues range from regulatory, technology, organizational development, budget, and most important, management of our expectations. Then we have to see what interactions we can have from the definition of the product, why? Because by not having a user identity system, it is practically impossible to precisely target them. I will put some examples here of these interactions according to the previous questions. Example Credits / Vaults. If we said that Vaults and Credits is our product, what targeted and specific marketing effort can we make to users? Practically none, they would be broad efforts, aimed at the general public and difficult to target, being very expensive and feeling like \u201cgeneric\u201d, then the interactions that we can create by the target audience and maker are also generic which do not add value or Long-term relationships and the user can easily substitute them for another product, however, the picture is different if these vaults are used for something specific which we can help develop, example Institutional Vaults. Stablecoin Example for Payments / Investments. If we choose this option, then our product resides one step after the Credit / Vault stage, and we have to take for granted that this particular \u201cpayment thing\u201d is so massively successful that it will bring a lot of vaults in the system. (Example, Videogame titles sell consoles not the other way around). For this option, we have to see what are all the rails that make it scalable and lucrative, something similar to what we talked about USDC several times before. Example for RWA. What is the internal dynamic that exists in the community to choose one RWA over another? Today, DAI has a limited \u201cbandwidth\u201d over the amount of DAI to emit without affecting the peg. The credit market is unimaginably insatiable and I am sure there would be many interested parties to get leverage with RWA and Dai. Luckily we have many players that could bring new collaterals like Centrifuge, RWA co., 6s, Growth Core Unit, or even companies posting on the collateral onboarding forum by themselves. I can see all these actors looking for limited \u201cDai bandwidth\u201d, why do I say this? Again,  Interactions is the key, I am sure that none of the named actors would want to contact possible new collateral to do the entire onboarding process and then tell them that it is not possible because there is no clear queue process to onboard them or some other undefined aspect. That is also marketing. In short, we can continue to analyze different interactions, purposes, and strategies, but there are things to solve to build the indicated processes that define the product for which to develop a strategy. Reason for my votes I doubt very much that a single Marketing Core Unit is the best for this, having more than 10 years of experience in this area, it does not hurt to say that I think that \u201cMarketing\u201d does not make much sense other than \u201cbranding and Advertising\u201d (which is needed) and that the real advantage exists in \u201cProduct Marketing Development\u201d which is 100% focused on attracting clients who make use of the \u201cjob to be done\u201d of the product, hence my voting that each line of business needs to have their marketing strategy/department.

For us, we need more steps and maturation to get to that non-crypto conversion and it costs a ton to do this type of marketing without having any results beyond media headlines. I think Mariano is making a great point to focus our attention on how to engage with the various end users of our ecosystem in the most relevant way. ",

Oracles  In addition to product-focused marketing efforts, it\u2019s also worth keeping an eye on MakerDAO as a brand and community and I agree with @MarianoDP\u2019s line of thinking in terms of focusing on MakerDAO\u2019s brand for now but making efforts toward product-specific efforts:     MarianoDP:  \u201cbranding and Advertising\u201d (which is needed) and that the real advantage exists in \u201cProduct Marketing Development\u201d which is 100% focused on attracting clients who make use of the \u201cjob to be done\u201d   As far as how CUs involved with marketing should be encouraged to specialize in their efforts, It\u2019s worth being intentional in deciding what types of marketing activities it makes sense for the DAO to engage in but I think it would be more efficient for us to encourage cooperation where it makes sense than to have different marketing teams for each use case. Different strategies, for sure, but one team that\u2019s done a good job with email marketing, for example, might be better suited to develop a new email marketing program for an up-and-coming use case than a new team we would bring on to handle that vertical. In-house teams will be more proactive and have a greater interest in advising on strategy and are generally more capable of organizing ongoing marketing activities, whereas agencies tend to specialize in specific forms of marketing and can be leveraged to take advantage of opportunities that they\u2019re strategically positioned to provide.

If money was unlimited and it seemed interesting to spend many millions of dollars branding on sports stadiums, subway stations, airports, disney land. sure knock yourself out. However, given we do have a responsibility to manage the DAO\u2019s limited treasury, in a manner that provides the best return for the community, and scales the protocol, I personally don\u2019t think broad based expensive branding campaigns for the sake of branding is the right strategy, at least right now. The cost per user acquisition would be absurdly expensive and not worth the spend IMO. For those types of branding initiatives it\u2019s not a one and done campaign, it\u2019s a long term commitment, often an \u201calways on\u201d effort which is very expensive. And again, even if the money is available, what are we branding? If an average user sees an add saying Dai is the world\u2019s unbiased currency and they want to find out more, they would need to go to an exchange to buy it, not just sign up for an account on our website which is a normal conversion path. Look at USDC, they haven\u2019t done much branding (to my knowledge) but their name is now widely known because of their Visa integration. Going back to Marianos point, we need to identify where our users are and what \u201cjob they need to do\u201d and that\u2019s how we target them. That could include more more mainstream venues like CNBC, fintech podcasts and working with our distribution partners to co-market. I don\u2019t claim to have the answers on where and what specifically to target but I think identifying the target users within our different product sets is the way to start to have the best impact and return. We don\u2019t have the luxury of a Varo bank as you mentioned, whose product is straightforward and the conversion is signing up for an account directly on their website. ",

We have way too much demand and not enough supply so any effort right now should be targeted towards vault owners and getting them to mint more DAI.   As a non-economist, I need some help with this concept. There is a cost to generating Dai. Thus Vault owners won\u2019t do it out of altruism and will therefore always need a way of earning revenues in excess of the SF. If such a way of generating revenues exists, then there is incentive for other users to buy Dai on the open market to gain the same returns (ignoring the gas fees, tech overhead, etc entailed in opening a Vault). TL;DR I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to incentivise the generation of additional Dai to lower the peg without incentives also existing for that Dai to be bought, pushing up the price. I don\u2019t think the fix for that is marketing. I may have missed something very fundamental here, in which case, apologies and I get to look stupid. ",

This seems like the George Carlin quote about fighting for peace\u2026 Ideally, the community would come up with a solution, which could then be pushed hard in marketing channels. For example (brace for inadequately thought-through suggestion), Liquidations 2.0 has made collateral auctions more efficient, such that the 13% penalty is probably now unnecessary. It could be reduced to e.g. 10%, and the remaining 3% distributed to Vault holders when other Vaults were liquidated, to effectively reduce their SF. That seems like a possible way of reducing costs without getting into murky negative rates territory. Then you push out that news via every marketing channel you can find. Institutional Vaults (high volume, low cost, low risk) are another way to increase supply significantly, and could be marketed enthusiastically. ",

A brand-focused marketing CU allows us to manage risks such as inconsistency that can erode trust and hurt our reputation. It also helps identify what we stand for, builds brand recognition and loyalty. My team and I look to help take on the gaps and functions which do not exist at MakerDAO, such as:   PR - Incoming press inquiries, pitching media & PR interviews and news coverage to tier 1 media like FT, Reuters, or Bloomberg   Reputation management - When the press gets the wrong information and interprets facts inaccurately, a team will help address the media inaccuracy and ensure that the right message is being communicated clearly.   Brand - The need to handle and maintain the consistency of the MakerDAO brand. To strenghten the brand values of MakerDAO.   Coordination     To have a focused messaging across different teams that is clear to our target audience.   Having a strategy towards events and conferences that includes a compilation of the biggest, most influential conferences and a list of MakerDAO spokespeople, and look to work out how MakerDAO can best utilize those opportunities.   Market research    Amplifying the use cases and new deals secured by other teams, to collect relevant business leads. To secure earned media based on any new MakerDAO developments and features through PR and marketing campaigns.  These are examples of key areas which we are looking to help solve and achieve through a closer collaboration with the community and the core units. Ultimately, what the unit wants to do is strike a balance between brand and performance marketing to strengthen our brand and deliver results. ",

Also, IMO, marketing MKR itself should be the last thing we promote. I\u2019ve grown to like how we keep MKR in the shadows. We openly promote DAI and our other products. MKR is for those who know.

At the same time, it\u2019s fair to CU applicants or anyone submitting a MIP that their application is reviewed and processed seriously. Indeed, putting a good foot forward to critique says a lot about the professionalism we exhibit here and, at least in my opinion, what actors expect from us going forward. tldr \u2013 better to offer more substance rather than a drive-by remark ",

I\u2019m paraphrasing here so for anyone who was on the call, please feel free to add anything I missed or clarify. While there\u2019s still plenty of interest and potential use cases in serving retail consumers, it\u2019s increasingly being recognized that we\u2019re in a better position to serve institutions, scale our offerings, and get to a point where some of the issues preventing us from effectively serving retail customers can be solved. What does this mean for marketing? While we want the DAO to get to a point where it makes sense to do product marketing that drives revenue, we first need to establish a strong product-market fit and that\u2019s something we\u2019re still navigating. At this stage, focusing on brand is where marketing can create value. The strength of our brand is what makes people excited about working with us. We plan to continue the conversation to talk about how a DAO decides on a brand and how to communicate about our focus on institutional customers. ",

Thus Vault owners won\u2019t do it out of altruism and will therefore always need a way of earning revenues in excess of the SF.  Just wanted to note that earning revenues isn\u2019t the only reason to generate DAI. People who hold a lot of crypto assets might also want to make real world purchases without liquidating those assets immediately, and so would appreciate knowing that there is a very low-interest collateralized loan available. For example, someone could lock ETH and pay 3.5% interest, generate DAI, sell for USDC with a 0.5% fee on Coinbase Pro, and convert to USD with no fee (to use e.g. as a down payment on a house or for a home improvement project). I know many people who are rich in ETH and BTC, want to continue holding, would like to spend a small portion in USD in the near term, but who don\u2019t know that it would be possible at such low interest rates with MakerDAO.  AstronautThis: We have way too much demand and not enough supply so any effort right now should be targeted towards vault owners and getting them to mint more DAI. Instead, the proposals so far have all been about DAI advertising, branding etc. which is actually gonna exacerbate our current peg problems.  I agree that we should prioritize raising awareness about the ability to take out collateralized loans at such low interest rates, for all the people out there who find themselves suddenly having much of their net worth in crypto assets.
