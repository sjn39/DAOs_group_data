My name is Juan. I am the facilitator of SES CU. Today we will focus on the Deco protocol. They are bringing interesting solutions to change variable fees for fixed fees. For other episodes of FO, please check the forum.

For example, we issue a million, claim, and then everybody flees to a new protocol, suddenly we lose a million? 40:37 - Planet_X: From a user interaction perspective, would it be possible to hide the claim fee ETH-A token, so the users do not see it? It is possible to secure a fixed rate of 20%, 50%, or 80% with your design. To make it simple, we could hide the entire token and have a check box to request a fixed rate. 42:35 - Someone: I want to ask about the auctioning of the Fee tokens. It seems that it is a key step, and that is where the risk for MakerDAO would arise. The risk that Maker is taking on is the interest rate fluctuation risk. You collect the equivalent of a fixed rate upfront. You committed to pay that out to fund the Fee tokens later. How do you ensure that those auctions are competitive in a bootstrapping phase? 46:53 - Planet_X: Is it 100% necessary to integrate this with the Maker protocol? Is it not possible to do a stand-alone development of this?  Closing Comment  Juan Guill\u00e9n  Outro 53:15  Thank you for coming and making this a bit clearer! We were all interested in the technology behind it. It was clarifying.  Vamsi Alluri: Thank you, everyone for joining!     Credits   @gala produced this summary.
