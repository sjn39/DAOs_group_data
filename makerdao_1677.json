                    "content": "One of the biggest split in the community those days seems to come from the fact that DAI is credit for some people while others see a currency (a system of money where there can be many monetary medium but sharing the same unit of account, DAI). If DAI is credit in the $-currency, you are a promise to get $1 and be valued $1. The least you fulfill this role, the less you have moneyness. You can enforce that by custodying higher level money, in which case you are a money certificate. Or you can use fractional-reserve banking and therefore you are a fiduciary media. There are some questions that a fiduciary media in a free banking system could work. If you are want to be a currency (i.e. depeging and being your own unit of account), then you need to be generally accepted somewhere. This means that goods and services in this somewhere (physical or the metaverse) are expressed/pegged to DAI. Then you can have second order effect as DAI would be a fiat currency. Stability (or whatever objective of the currency) would be created by dealing with the interest rates. Aren\u2019t we (the crypto space) working toward a hard currency (BTC or ETH) with a disregard of fiat currencies? Is it something temporary until those harder currency take the lead (but too volatile for now?). Is the control of the currency by a democracy bad but control of the currency by a capitalistic system good? It also doesn\u2019t mean that a credit form of money can\u2019t become a currency. This is what happened to the US dollar. It was first a credit instrument pegged to gold before moving to a currency. But a key point is that this transition was done when the US Dollar was a generally recognized mean of exchange. Things where expressed in $, no longer in ounce of gold. No right or wrong answers here, just a temperature check.     DAI is credit DAI is a currency DAI is credit but should be a currency asap DAI is something else Abstain Don\u2019t know/don\u2019t care     0 voters     ",

Kind of akin to inside/outside money dichotomy depending on who\u2019s facilitating the transaction. This seems true of traditional currency systems as well. The local market for Dai can be considered the Maker protocol or any native marketplace. Maker can pursue policies that make it more attractive on an international basis (like a tight dollar peg) while also pursuing productive domestic policies (i.e. tuning SF rates or D3M integrations). There is clearly groups within the community that care more abut some markets over others, but I don\u2019t think they have to be mutually exclusive as your poll indicates. Happy to be educated tho.

I have long maintained that since DAI is only redeemed by borrowers for collateral (or by DAI holders during an ES for a collateral share) that DAI is only a \u2018unit of collateral on account\u2019.   That is it.   DAI isn\u2019t a credit (because this assumes there is something the holder can exchange for at all times and this generally is only true for borrowers). Now whether DAI fulfills as a currency your point stands.     SebVentures:  If you are want to be a currency (i.e. depeging and being your own unit of account), then you need to be generally accepted somewhere. This means that goods and services in this somewhere (physical or the metaverse) are expressed/pegged to DAI.   This was something during the 2011-2014 years of Bitcoin that was watched carefully.  How many places accepted Bitcoin for \u2018products\u2019.   BTC and ETH for the most part have been rejected as a medium of exchange for products with many important vendors mostly due to price volatility causing issues with normal capital flows in the business both from revenue sides (since you had to convert crypto to taxable cash to book the tx) and in refunds.   For some time I wondered why Maker wasn\u2019t building a DAI marketplace, but then we cycle back to the same business issues (converting DAI to local currency to book the sale(fees/overhead), and back to refund).  It wasn\u2019t clear building a DAI marketplace really would grow DAI use nor how much this would cost. ",

SebVentures:  currency  (a system of money where there can be many monetary medium but sharing the same unit of account, DAI).    A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state.[3] Under this definition, U.S. dollars (US$), euros (\u20ac), Indian rupee (\u20b9), Japanese yen (\u00a5), and pounds sterling (\u00a3) are examples of (government-issued) fiat currencies. Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.[4] Currencies in this sense are either chosen by users or decreed by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance  For credit, I would refer to fiduciary media.  Fiduciary media consist of the proportion of perfect money substitutes which a bank issues but does not fully back by physical monetary units (i.e. gold or paper money) in their vaults. [1] Fiduciary media can exist in many forms including credit notes, checks or drafts.  I hope it clarifies. ",

Today DAI is USD denominated debt that is over collateralized by (mostly) volatile assets. This is primarily because DAI is minted by undergoing a CDP agreement with the smart contract, which has an interest rate and carries a risk premium. The risk premium is typically represented by how far it deviates from the peg, but this is imperfect due to the PSMs and the serious information asymmetry that exists in crypto. It\u2019s rare that DAI is used to pay for goods and services outside Maker so we can\u2019t consider it a currency or money. DAI is also not a commodity. Bitcoin is. Eth likely is. But it\u2019s not produced from human/machine capital and/or scarce natural resources and isn\u2019t produced by more than one entity. Because it doesn\u2019t come with dividend or voting rights I would not consider DAI to be a security (doesn\u2019t meet the Howie test). Alternatively DAI could be considered a derivative instead of a debt instrument. Whereby the value of DAI is derived from USD spot price of the underlying collateral and I\u2019ve had this discussion with multiple regulators. ",

If the reference asset(s) for DAI are a blend of commodities (eth??) and securities (treasuries, other crypto assets), what does that mean? Would the characterization of DAI depend on the vault or specific collateral that minted each individual DAI? So might DAI therefore in fact have qualities of being non-fungible? Aside: Proof-of-work mining origin is really very helpful in giving a crypto asset true qualities of a commodity from a pure common sense perspective. Energy is neither created nor destroyed in the universe they say, so electricity generated and flowing through a system to produce a unique product looks a lot like catching beavers, and skinning them to produce a desirable beaver pelt that was once both a valuable scarce commodity, money and currency:   coins.nd.edu   Money Substitutes in New Netherland and Early New York From Coins of Colonial and Early America, an exhibit of over 250 items from Massachusetts silver to the provisional half disme of 1792. Features high-resolution images and detailed descriptions.       The earliest mention of the value of a beaver pelt in the New Netherland laws appears in the mid 1650\u2019s when the West India Company tried to devalue the price of beaver. This was during the height of the beaver trade when about 80,000 pelts were being exported annually. The increased imports resulted in an oversupply of furs which led to a decrease in the value of the beaver in Amsterdam. Therefore, the West India Company was simply trying to reflect the economic situation by devaluing the beaver in New Netherland, so it would be relative to the value in Amsterdam.   This became a major problem because in New Netherland the beaver was not just a commodity. It was also a negotiable instrument like our paper currency and even more, it was the standard by which other significant money substitutes were measured. To devalue the beaver was to devalue the currency. However for the Amsterdam directors, if the beaver was not devalued, the profit margin for the West India Company stockholders would diminish and the situation would continue to deteriorate until the supply was brought in line with demand.

Discussions I\u2019ve had is that it\u2019s more likely a derivative of a commodity (ETH) and if you wrap cash/treasury backed stablecoins (USDC) then those could likely be considered deposit receipts (unless regulators want to take the money market fund line).

Excellent questions. I don\u2019t think anyone, including regulators really know at this point and I certainly don\u2019t feel comfortable making a call here (not a lawyer, accountant or capital markets guy). ",
