Issuer: ATD Combustors, a UAE limited liability company (ATDC) Advisor to ATDC: Oasis Pro Markets LLC (together with its affiliates, Oasis Pro)  Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token.  Real World Asset Proposed: Note(s) secured by the Security Guarantor and Collateral. The Note(s) will be full recourse obligations to ATDC and the Security Guarantor. This MIP6 is submitted by Oasis Pro, as advisor, to propose a new asset for the Real World Asset Core Unit involving the Note(s) issued by ATDC. Subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds and to facilitate liquidity and market-based valuation, the Bonds, as well as equity of the Company, could be listed on Oasis Pro\u2019s alternative trading system. While this MIP6 is for a $35mm financing, the opportunity to fund additional green projects in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East could be as much as $500mm - $1bn. Collateral: ATDC will provide collateral guarantee of: Cashflows/receivables under existing Services Agreement between ATDC and the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC), a company representing the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, entered into in August 2016, and a pledged cash account in ADGM. Under this agreement, ATDC receives a share of the plant\u2019s cost savings, and such USD savings will be deposited into a pledged ADGM cash account until disbursement (as specified or limited in the final documentation). Investor in Bonds for the benefit of MakerDAO: a legal entity organized in Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM entity).  Provide a brief history of the project.  This MIP6 is submitted by Oasis Pro, as advisor, to propose a new asset for the Real World Asset Core Unit involving the Note(s) issued by ATDC. Subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds and to facilitate liquidity and market-based valuation, the Bonds, as well as equity of the Company, could be listed on Oasis Pro\u2019s alternative trading system. While this MIP6 is for a $35mm financing, the opportunity to fund additional green projects in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East could be as much as $500mm - $1bn. Established in 2014, ATDC is registered in the UAE and has operations in Egypt and the UAE. ATDC is engaged in the development of state-of-the-art clean technology for power generation, the execution of energy savings and performance enhancing projects to reduce energy costs. ATDC\u2019s application-based R&D and combustion technology expertise are utilized to design and develop conventional, hybrid and renewable customized solutions for power generation. ATDC also provides energy optimization of plant performance, the operation and maintenance of sustainable solutions for power generation and energy and water savings for industrial facilities, buildings, and large venues. In the Middle East, unlike much of Europe and the U.S., the use of natural gas and transition to greenfield solar and wind farms is not always an available option to reduce carbon emissions. ATDC is a leading provider in the Middle East of green carbon-reducing strategies and technologies that improve the efficiency of existing power plant systems, thereby both reducing the overall fuel usage and generating of carbon credits. In its pilot project, ATDC has been successful in increasing the fuel efficiency of the Walidia power plant. The Al-Walidia power plant in Egypt is a performing example of ATDC\u2019s implementation of its fuel-reducing technology and the first such improvement project in Egypt. ATDC has a 12-year agreement with EEHC to provide services in respect of the Al-Walidia power plant. ATDC has completed performance on the first four years of the 12-year term agreed upon by ATDC and EEHC. The project has three key objectives: a. Reduce fuel cost by creating fuel efficiencies \u2014The project has reduced fuel cost by 5.2% to date. b. Generate carbon credits through a reduction in fuel usage \u2014 The fuel reduction at the Al-Walidia power plant produces approximately 130,000 tons per annum in carbon credits. c. Reduce overall plant maintenance cost \u2014 The efficiencies implemented by ATDC have to date resulted in reducing the operation and maintenance cost by 0.71 cents/kWh. Because of the initial success of this project, the Egyptian authorities have offered to join ATDC in its effort via a partnership agreement to benefit six additional power stations. ATDC is also expected to finance and execute power plants rehabilitation, improve fuel savings and plant efficiency, reduce electricity consumption and supervise O&M teams. Furthermore, ATDC has invested in the development of a new technology called \u201cT-fire Combustor\u201d. ATDC is in the process of establishing the first design of the combustor for AVON engines. This combustor will lower nitric oxide emissions as well as improve the reliability / availably and extend the life of the combustor/engine and is adaptable with various types of engines.

This report is available confidentially.  Link to any active communities relating to your project.  The Case for Green Money: The case for Clean Money  How is the applying collateral type currently used?  ATDC has a 12-year agreement with EEHC to provide services in respect of the Al-Walidia power plant. ATDC has completed performance on the first four years of the 12-year term agreed upon by ATDC and EEHC. The investment requested in this MIP is not only backed by the revenue from ATDC\u2019s pilot Egyptian energy project, but also the full and unconditional guarantee of Al Hail, the investment vehicle, of UAE royal family member, used to invest in emerging growth areas, such as green technologies. Al Hail has significant holdings in UAE real estate, banking and technology companies like ATDC. Based on audited financial statements, Al Hail had approximately 360mm AED cash (USD 98mm) and 1,820mm AED (USD 500mm) as of 9/30/2021.  Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in?  The collateral and support for the Notes will be the cashflows/receivables under the existing Services Agreement between ATDC and the EEHC and the full and unconditional guarantee by Al Hail (the family office of a royal family member). The Notes will have full recourse to ATDC and Al Hail will guarantee all of ATDC\u2019s obligations under the Notes. Both ATDC and Al Hail are domiciled in the UAE.  Where does exchange for the asset occur?  It is contemplated that the Notes will be purchased by a legal entity organized in the Abu Dhabi Global Markets for the benefit of the MakerDao ecosystem.  (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review.  The preliminary structure has been vetted by Latham & Watkins, but any additional written advice may be provided as necessary upon approval of this MIP6.  (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable.  As stated in 10 above, a preliminary structure was established, but further legal and regulatory due diligence will be conducted after the approval of this MIP 6.  (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type.  TBD.  (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type.  N/A  Provide (a) proposed legal structure for transaction, including: type of legal entities, (offshore/onshore, form (trust, corporate, other)) and jurisdiction(s) of legal entities, and (b) likely funds flow (DAI => Fiat => DAI).  Legal documentation and the set up any new ADGM or other legal entity to invest in the Bonds, will be handled by Latham & Watkins, as counsel to Oasis Pro, who is an advisor to India Power in connection with this financing. MakerDAO\u2019s legal counsel, North Lakes Legal PLLC, would review such documentation and perform any legal assessments deemed necessary. India Power will be responsible for the legal fees incurred in executing this transaction. Note, while this MIP6 contemplates an ADGM entity as the investor of record for the Bonds, after further assessment of tax, regulatory and other legal issues, it may be determined that the investor of record should be domiciled in another jurisdiction. In the unlikely event of an emergency shutdown occurring with the MakerDAO community, it shall be possible to move the tokens to a holder (subject to KYC and AML checks) in order to transfer and redeem the underlying value. It is anticipated that North Lakes Legal will perform the necessary assessments for this MIP, including, but not limited to: (1) reviewing and negotiating any legal documentation evidencing the Notes, any guarantee and any collateral granted to secure the Notes obligations, as well as any ancillary or supplemental documentation, (2) reviewing security interest documents and advice relating to perfection thereof in Egypt and (3) reviewing any regulatory advice obtained in connection with this transaction. Internationally-recognized legal counsel may be engaged to advise for the benefit of MakerDao. The following diagram illustrates the proposed structure:   Provide details on the organizational structure of the interested party, beneficial ownership, governance/control, key personnel, capital/funding resources and past financial performance.  Al Hail the guarantor is the investment vehicle of a UAE royal family member used to invest in emerging growth areas, such as green technologies. Al Hail has significant holdings in UAE real estate, banking and technology companies like ATDC. Based on audited financial statements, Al Hail had approximately 360mm AED cash (USD 98mm) and 1,820mm AED (USD 500mm) as of 9/30/2021. ATDC is the primary obligor and Al Hail has a [majority] ownership in ATDC. For the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 ATDC has reported rises in annual net income of 4.8mm AED, 7.3mm AED, and 8.9mm AED respectively. This translates to a year-over-year growth rate of 53% in 2019 and 23% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, ATDC had approximately 98mm AED in net assets. The Services Agreement generates cash and receivables collateral. The Services Agreement provides that ATDC will incur capex to improve the Al Walidia plants\u2019 efficiency, and in exchange will receive cost savings which will be shared with the plant pursuant to the agreement. Please see the table below for estimates of the costs and revenues estimate for the remaining term of the Services Agreement.  The sufficiency of the Al Hail guarantee and the collateral to be pledged to the ADGM entity will be assessed by MakerDAO\u2019s credit representatives with assistance from a third-party reputable firm as needed. Any third-party credit analysis will be paid for by ATDC.  Provide detailed summary of the proposed economic terms of the transaction, including, without limitation: commitment term, principal amount, interest rate, frequency of principal and interest payments, disbursement schedule, equity amount, funding ratios (equity/debt pro rata, equity first, etc.), collateral security, coverage ratios, currency (if not DAI) and other material terms. The quality of the proposed economic terms will be a consideration for the prioritization process.  ATDC has a 12-year agreement with EEHC to provide services in respect of the Al-Walidia power plant. ATDC has completed performance on the first four years of the 12-year term agreed upon by ATDC and EEHC. Principal: $35 Million (USD). The Note(s) will be funded using MakerDAO\u2019s existing USDC holdings, or if such USDC is exhausted or, if MakerDAO prefers a DAI funding, then DAI will be minted to fund the investment in Note(s). In either case, USDC or DAI will be converted to USD using a third-party exchange. Stated Maturity: 5 years. Coupon: [2-2.5%] annualized, paid on a quarterly basis, together with a portion of the principal as set out in the amortization schedule to be agreed by ATDC and the RWA Core Unit.  Identify in reasonable detail the risks associated with this collateral application and the underlying asset(s) and proposed mitigants (if any). The risk summary should address, without limitation and to the extent relevant: market risks, commercial risks (e.g., diversification, credit, etc.), interest rate risks, legal and regulatory risks, general industry risks, competition, etc.  The main risks arising from ATDC\u2019s financial instruments are currency risk and credit risk. Currency Risk ATDC manages currency risk through regular monitoring of the currency markets to determine appropriate action to minimize the exposure to the foreign currency risk. There are no significant exchange risks as substantially all the financial assets and liabilities are denominated in UAE Dirhams or US Dollars to which UAE Dirhams is pegged. Credit Risk Concentration of credit risk is due to 100% of ATDC\u2019s trade receivables being from one customer. To offset this risk, ATD has received an unconditional guarantee from Al Hail.  Outline the applicant\u2019s underwriting guidelines/policies, origination strategy (marketing, sales, channels), servicing strategy (charge-offs, collections), and historical asset performance.  The Al Walidia power plant project is ATDC\u2019s pilot project and the obligations of EEHC are supported by the Egyptian government.  Outline the applicant\u2019s risk monitoring and operations guidelines/policies (e.g., charge-offs, collection, recovery provisions, data collection and technology, etc).  ATDC manages currency risk through regular monitoring of the currency markets to determine appropriate action to minimize the exposure to the foreign currency risk. There are no significant exchange risks as substantially all the financial assets and liabilities are denominated in UAE Dirhams or US Dollars to which UAE Dirhams is pegged.  Describe the regulatory regime applicable to the underlying asset (if any) and the applicant\u2019s legal and compliance program relating thereto.  A further review of the laws and regulations in the UAE, ADGM and Egypt as they relate to the issuance and purchase of the Notes will be conducted after the approval of this MIP6.  Identify any 3rd party persons likely to be relied upon by applicant to implement the transaction (legal, accounting, servicers, trustees, etc.).  Latham & Watkins will provide legal services, including drafting documents, performing necessary regulatory reviews, setting up a new entity in ADGM. Local Egyptian counsel will also be required to advise on any due diligence questions and advise on the security interest in the receivables under the Services Agreement.

                    "content": "OPM, thanks for the thoughtful MIPs. Glad to see some interesting proposals at the intersection of EM x energy efficiency finally hit the forums. To set the stage, some questions:   As proposed, the yield is 1-1.5% with a .25% stability fee. What\u2019s the mechanism here? 1.5% would be the all-in yield to the first-loss tranche of the debt (assuming ATDC is holding some risk retention) and Maker\u2019s Senior position would yield .25%? Or is .25% a guaranteed fixed yield to the MakerDAO vault and the remainder is variable? If the latter is the case, variable based on what?   The gross yield on this debt is maximum 1.5% for five years. The yield on 1-year US Treasuries is 1.77%. The former has a guarantee from Al Hail, the latter the US government, the best credit on earth. What is the pricing rationale here?   What is OPMs understanding of the geopolitical risk present in Egypt at the moment? Due to ATDC\u2019s agreement with EEHC (The \u201cEgyptian Electricity Holding Company\u201d is responsible for all power plants, transmission and distribution in the Arab Republic of Egypt), ATDC\u2019s likelihood of being paid for services rendered is tied to EEHC solvency. The EEHC relies on Egyptian government subsidies. So MakerDAO credit risk is de facto Egyptian sovereign credit risk. Is there any reason to think that Egyptian sovereign debt has eroded or will continue to erode?   Greening: If I understand correctly, ATDC will make modifications to existing fuel turbines and unlock latent efficiencies. To me, people often ignore the practical value of modifying existing systems to reduce carbon emissions. It is much sexier to build renewables projects anew but such thinking is a luxury of decadent society. Can you confirm or direct me to a resource where I can read about the nature of the turbines MakerDAO will functionally be supporting? These are heavy fuel oil furnace + turbines, correct? Are these turbines mid-life or are they functionally at the end of their useful lives? Are we reviving an asset that should be retired and replaced with something greener?   ",

There is the possibility that this would not be viewed as a sustainability project if the majority of the funds are not being used to directly reducing fossil fuel consumption, and are viewed instead as extending the life of a fossil fuel burning plant.   I believe that the amounts quoted for what is available to Al Hail are on a consolidated basis. If so, are you able to provide a snapshot of what Al Hail has on a standalone basis to backstop the guarantee? Specifically, this would be its most recent cash position (not cash in subsidiaries), available credit facilities, etc. that would be used to support its obligations as guarantor.

                    "content": "Thank you to @teej, @brian and others for the thoughtful comments. We are excited to be working on this opportunity with you and the Maker community. The following are in response to Teej\u2019s questions and we are preparing responses to the other questions posted in consultation with ATDC.   As proposed, the yield is 1-1.5% with a .25% stability fee. What\u2019s the mechanism here? 1.5% would be the all-in yield to the first-loss tranche of the debt (assuming ATDC is holding some risk retention) and Maker\u2019s Senior position would yield .25%? Or is .25% a guaranteed fixed yield to the MakerDAO vault and the remainder is variable? If the latter is the case, variable based on what?   The original rate proposed in brackets in the MIP did not reflect recent USD interest rate increases. However, in light of the current environment, we propose a range of 2-2.5% for these secured, guaranteed notes which will represent senior obligations of both ATDC and Al Hail.   The gross yield on this debt is maximum 1.5% for five years. The yield on 1-year US Treasuries is 1.77%. The former has a guarantee from Al Hail, the latter the US government, the best credit on earth. What is the pricing rationale here?   As mentioned above, we are revising the interest rate proposed to 2-2.5%. Al Hail, the guarantor of the notes, is the investment vehicle of a UAE royal family member. Al Hail represents his personal investments in emerging growth areas, such as green technology. As mentioned in the MIP, the guarantee provided will be an unconditional guarantee which will cover all of ATDC\u2019s payment obligations under the notes.   What is OPMs understanding of the geopolitical risk present in Egypt at the moment? Due to ATDC\u2019s agreement with EEHC (The \u201cEgyptian Electricity Holding Company\u201d is responsible for all power plants, transmission and distribution in the Arab Republic of Egypt), ATDC\u2019s likelihood of being paid for services rendered is tied to EEHC solvency. The EEHC relies on Egyptian government subsidies. So MakerDAO credit risk is de facto Egyptian sovereign credit risk. Is there any reason to think that Egyptian sovereign debt has eroded or will continue to erode?   Since its formation in 1976, EEHC has not defaulted on any of its commitments. Currently, international development organizations, such as the German KFW and the World Bank are funding EEHC\u2019s expansion. Due to the reduction in government subsidies, the prices for electricity have increased and are expected to continue to increase until 2025 (when the subsidies end). For further reference, please find a Fitch ratings summary for Egypt. https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-affirms-egypt-at-b-outlook-stable-20-10-2021 Also, IRENA anticipates growth in the Egyptian economy, as illustrated in the chart below:  ATDC Question 3 Table936\u00d7764 297 KB    Greening: If I understand correctly, ATDC will make modifications to existing fuel turbines and unlock latent efficiencies. To me, people often ignore the practical value of modifying existing systems to reduce carbon emissions. It is much sexier to build renewables projects anew but such thinking is a luxury of decadent society. Can you confirm or direct me to a resource where I can read about the nature of the turbines MakerDAO will functionally be supporting? These are heavy fuel oil furnace + turbines, correct? Are these turbines mid-life or are they functionally at the end of their useful lives? Are we reviving an asset that should be retired and replaced with something greener?   Teej, you are correct. The Egyptian power plant has two 300 MWe boilers, each producing (1000 tons/hr) steam at high pressure (167 Bar) and high temperature (540C). The generated steam expands in two 300MWe steam turbines to generate electricity. To maintain the high performance of the equipment, ATDC has dedicated a full-time technical team placed in the plant for the duration of the contract with EEHC. This dedicated team closely monitors the units on a daily basis and takes necessary preventive measures to maximize the reduction in fuel consumption, which in turn results in lower carbon emissions. The plant\u2019s book value will be realized by 2036. ATDC\u2019s contract ends in 2029. Also, it is noteworthy to mention that the plant has been central to stabilizing Egypt\u2019s power grid and connecting the north with the south of Egypt. Replacing the fossil-based plants by intermittent renewables plants in that region in the foreseeable future is not feasible for the stability of the grid. ",

Can you please explain the proposed waterfall mechanism? i.e. a proposed SF of .25% but an all-in yield to MakerDAO of 1-1.5% (2.5% if proposal changes as per recent OPM comms).     OasisProTeam:  The original rate proposed in brackets in the MIP did not reflect recent USD interest rate increases. However, in light of the current environment, we propose a range of 2-2.5% for these secured, guaranteed notes which will represent senior obligations of both ATDC and Al Hail.   The point is well-taken, though it does worry me a bit that the initial proposal was 1-1.5%. Though short-term US treasury rates have risen significantly over the past couple months, they\u2019ve been rising more or less for the last six months, so the financial world has long since adjusted. The two-year has been above 1.5% for two months. The five-year, our risk free rate of like-kind duration for the ATDC proposed transaction, has been above 1.5% since January. The initial proposal feels like a low-ball that wouldn\u2019t get done on the open market. Could be wrong, will leave it to the MakerDAO hive mind to sort it. A less empirical, more intuitive take: Maybe the guarantee from Al Hail excites other senior lenders, but seems like a messy dynamic that wouldn\u2019t benefit MakerDAO as it would those with local knowledge of gulf politics, finance, and general norms. The prospect of MakerDAO forcing compliance of a credit guarantee by the UAE Royal Family in a gulf court is almost laughable to consider. I could be deeply off-base here. As you\u2019ve mentioned, ATDC would cover third-party credit analysis. This brings some comfort, but it suffers from incentive design as an \u201cissuer pays\u201d model.     beedubs:  You note that the AED:USD risk does not exist as AED are pegged to the dollar. However, is there a plan to mitigate the EGP:USD currency risk?   I was curious about this as well. 10.5% EGP inflation as of March. Not much higher than USD I suppose lol     OasisProTeam:  Since its formation in 1976, EEHC has not defaulted on any of its commitments. Currently, international development organizations, such as the German KFW and the World Bank are funding EEHC\u2019s expansion. Due to the reduction in government subsidies, the prices for electricity have increased and are expected to continue to increase until 2025 (when the subsidies end). For further reference, please find a Fitch ratings summary for Egypt.   Good data point. Where can it be independently verified? Though past performance is not indicative of future performance, it\u2019s the best predictor we\u2019ve got. If performance was steady through the Arab Spring, that says something. With that said, what worries me is the unique salvo of macro events converging on the Egyptian government and, by extension, EEHC, at the moment. As many macro-savvy community members are aware, the Egyptian government subsidizes energy and foodstuffs, an example of which is wheat, for the benefit of its citizens. Since 1989, subsidized bakeries have provided 20 loaves of bread for one Egyptian Pound. Because Egypt imports 86% of its wheat from Ukraine/Russia, its government will have to either work the higher commodity prices into the budget (increase the fiscal deficit) or renege on this 30-year promise. Anwar Sadat attempted to remove bread subsidies in 1977, only to change tack when violent riots started. The Arab Spring was also, in some part, catalyzed by high food prices. The sovereign budget accounts for bread prices of $255 per tonne; prices on futures markets are near $400 per tonne. The adjustment to the federal budget will be equivalent to 0.3% of GDP. This article by The Economist summarizes the issue nicely. As of a Reuters article dated 3/8/2022, EGP-denominated government bonds have been decimated, trading in the 63-66 cent range, an all-time low. Investors are demanding a 980 bps spread over like-duration US treasuries, an all-time high. For those unfamiliar, a spread is the increase yield beyond a \u201crisk-free rate\u201d that an investor demands for holding an asset. Spreads blow out as the perceived risk of holding an asset increases. Finally, credit default swaps on Egyptian sovereign debt are at all time highs. CDS on five-year Egyptian sovereign debt. As per this chart which tracks Egyptian CDS prices,, it appears these fundamentals have since improved. I am not a macro expert but this does strike me as a uniquely bad time to be making five year bets, for which we are paid 1-2.5% on a country with a non-trivial chance of popular revolt. We could just buy a five-year treasury and call it a day.     OasisProTeam:  The plant\u2019s book value will be realized by 2036. ATDC\u2019s contract ends in 2029.   So we are potentially funding through 2027, so we need to think about our take-out financing as of 2026. We need to hope that either A) the party that refinances our loan is comfortable with three years remaining on the contract term or B) the contract gets renewed/extended over the course of our loan. So, in other words, more risk. @christiancdpetersen Please mansplain to me if I am oversimplifying. @Recognized-Delegates Please add some fodder, especially if you\u2019ve familiarity with energy, Egypt, or the Middle East.

Well, not much of an expert on the region\u2013but as you know hard financial assets are a key commodity in a high inflationary environment. And unfortunately Oil will continue to be the leading asset class of this region, we have to think with the current inflationary environment, this region will pull more Oil investments into it. I was recently reading about a region in Western Australia, called Pilbara. It\u2019s a huge, dry region known for its \u201cred earth\u201d and mineral deposits. It is also a biodiversity \u201chotspot.\u201d  Supposedly the wind almost always blows and the sun shines a lot. Hence, it\u2019s a huge renewable energy source, that has a current proposal (can\u2019t remember by who) that will develop the largest power plant in the world to supply renewable energy to Asia. So, where else besides Pilabara (AU) can you find a hot, dry place with constant winds and lots of sunshine? The Middle East. And as I mentioned earlier, this region supplies a lot of energy via Oil tankers, specially to Asia. Can Egypt/Middle East duplicate the Pilbara concept and replace oil and gas with something like, carbon free hydrogen? That remains to be seen. And it will need some serious investments. Again, not knowledgeable enough to produce a concrete view\u2013only an educated guess. It is also why the Delegates have asked for Help via the reformed greenlight process with RWAs\u2013which includes the opinions and views of the RWF CU, LOVE, Legal, and CES. However, we do have a few folks/friends that are more informed with regards to the region, and we\u2019ll try to dig in for more details as possible. Usually these folks always question the low rates that Maker offers to lenders, for high-risk loans. All-in-all we are interested in continuing to follow the due-dilly process that you are currently providing to MKR token owners and Delegates, and for taking time to do such, we say Thank You! Much appreciated Teej. ",

Please note that these are high level questions/observations based on the information provided to date. A more comprehensive diligence and analysis of the overall transaction, contracts, cash-flow, etc. is required to form a complete picture and form an educated opinion.   As noted elsewhere, we will need to diligence the credit profile of Al-Hail.   We assume that the guarantee will be a standard English law guarantee with customary waivers of defenses etc.   We will want to ensure that Al Hail can be sued and that any claims against Al Hail and ADT are enforceable in UAE.   To confirm if the service fees payable by EEHC are denominated in USD.       OasisProTeam:  ATDC receives a share of the plant\u2019s cost savings, and such USD savings will be deposited into a pledged ADGM cash account   If not, we will need to understand the FX risk associated with conversion.  To confirm whether EEHC pays ADT in Egypt or in the ADGM.      OasisProTeam:  and such USD savings will be deposited into a pledged ADGM cash account until disbursement    Are the carbon credits part of the collateral guarantee? It is unclear.      OasisProTeam:  Generate carbon credits through a reduction in fuel usage \u2014 The fuel reduction at the Al-Walidia power plant produces approximately 130,000 tons per annum in carbon credits.    The incubating LTS will have to work closely with @collateral-core-unit and @strat-fin-core-unit to think through the use of USDC as the funding base (versus the creation of a new vault, the creation of a MIP21 dummy token, and the minting of DAI). Presumably the USDC is in the PSM? This may work, but I have not been asked to consider before.      OasisProTeam:  Investor in Bonds for the benefit of MakerDAO: a legal entity organized in Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM entity)     This will be the first proposal using a legal entity in the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (a free trade zone established in the UAE). Abu Dhabi Global Markets has been used as a jurisdiction for traditional project financings, so there is precedent. Further, as Abu Dhabi Global Markets directly adopt English common law, this should be beneficial from a contractual perspective. For instance, the use of a trust may be an option. The English Common Law System   The details of the legal entity will need to be developed. The focus will be on ensuring (1) a high level of transparency, (2) there is a person(s) is acting in the interests of Maker, and (3) a high degree of trustlessness. See paragraph 5 in Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions       OasisProTeam:  MakerDAO\u2019s legal counsel, North Lakes Legal PLLC, would review such documentation and set up the ADGM entity with assistance from Latham & Watkins if necessary.    It would be helpful if OPM (or Latham) could do the actual work to establish the ADGM entity. I am happy to provide guidance, suggestions, support, etc., but this should not be a direct activity of North Lakes Legal.      OasisProTeam:  It is anticipated that North Lakes Legal will perform the necessary assessments for this MIP    North Lakes Legal (acting for the incubating LTS) can only prepare a legal risk assessment. The other core units will prepare their respective risk assessments.      OasisProTeam:  (3) taking all actions deemed necessary to perfect any security interest (by way of security transfer or title transfer)    I would expect the borrower to complete the steps necessary to perfect the security interest. Of course, the incubating LTS will make assess from the Maker perspective.      OasisProTeam:  taking any and all other actions deemed reasonable and necessary to complete the transaction described herein    The incubating LTS is not a party to the transaction, so this is a bit broad.      OasisProTeam:  including the engagement of internationally-recognized legal counsel to advise for the benefit of MakerDAO    Yes, subject to external firm due diligence requirements. This remains an on-going challenge, but I continue to push firms forward on this issue.      OasisProTeam:  Please see the table below for estimates of the costs and revenues estimate for the remaining term of the Services Agreement.    Does the financial model contemplate any tax on the service fee payments made by EHCC to ADT? This might be a withholding tax payable by EHCC or a tax on ADT itself in Egypt.      teej:  We need to hope that either A) the party that refinances our loan is comfortable with three years remaining on the contract term or B) the contract gets renewed/extended over the course of our loan.    It will depend on whether the Maker funded loan is fully repaid at the end of the 5 year term. What is the amortization profile? It is not clear to me from the proposed terms. But I agree with @teej if the economics assume a bullet payment (or a large principal payment at maturity).      OasisProTeam:  In addition to making the Al Walidia plant more energy efficient, ATDC will integrate a solar thermal system at the plant.   While not a legal comment, the International Energy Agency refers to \u201cenergy efficiency\u201d as the \u201cfirst fuel\u201d (the fuel you do not have to use) given its important impact on climate mitigation. The \u201cefficiency\u201d angle is (for a project finance lawyer) an interesting opportunity. ",

There is the possibility that this would not be viewed as a sustainability project if the majority of the funds are not being used to directly reducing fossil fuel consumption, and are viewed instead as extending the life of a fossil fuel burning plant.   After the approval of this MIP6, we can provide detailed financial information for both companies confidentially. In the short and intermediate term, thermal plants in Egypt will not be replaced by other technologies. The government has a policy to diversify its energy supply mix to secure the continuous supply of electricity to the country. If, for example, the natural gas supply is disrupted, you need to have an alternative energy source available to generate the needed electricity. A case in point, look at Germany\u2019s predicament with the Russian gas supply now. Germany eliminated their nuclear fleet as well some of their coal plants and now they are at the mercy of a single energy source.  Diversification of energy sources is beneficial in the event that one or more of these sources is disrupted. Even after the plant is fully depreciated in 2036, it does not mean that the equipment cannot continue to run. Power plants typically run much longer than their book value.  The current average plant\u2019s age is 27 years old. See below for the average of the plant ages that have been retired in the US between 2000 and 2015. Using the data below as a guide, the Walidia plant is operating within its life parameters. The work ATDC has completed and continues is to maximize its efficiency and reduce its fuel consumption by improving the performance of the equipment and integrating a solar based system in the cycle.  Retired Power Plants1815\u00d7944 180 KB    I believe that the amounts quoted for what is available to Al Hail are on a consolidated basis. If so, are you able to provide a snapshot of what Al Hail has on a standalone basis to backstop the guarantee? Specifically, this would be its most recent cash position (not cash in subsidiaries), available credit facilities, etc. that would be used to support its obligations as guarantor.   After the approval of this MIP6, we can provide detailed financial information for both companies confidentially.   You note that the AED:USD risk does not exist as AED are pegged to the dollar. However, is there a plan to mitigate the EGP:USD currency risk?   The EGP portion of the amounts paid under the Services Agreement to ATDC will be reinvested back into the efficiency projects to finance the plant improvements described in this MIP6. The majority of the savings under the Services Agreement are paid to ATDC by EEHC in USD to its bank account. This represents 65% of the savings. ",

                    "content": "Again, thank you for the thoughtful questions @teej. We appreciate the enthusiasm for this project.  Can you please explain the proposed waterfall mechanism? i.e. a proposed SF of .25% but an all-in yield to MakerDAO of 1-1.5% (2.5% if proposal changes as per recent OPM comms).  The original rate proposed in brackets in the MIP did not reflect recent USD interest rate increases. However, in light of the current environment, we propose a range of 2-2.5% for these secured, guaranteed notes which will represent senior obligations of both ATDC and Al Hail.  The point is well-taken, though it does worry me a bit that the initial proposal was 1-1.5%. Though short-term US treasury rates have risen significantly over the past couple months, they\u2019ve been rising more or less for the last six months, so the financial world has long since adjusted. The two-year has been above 1.5% for two months. The five-year, our risk free rate of like-kind duration for the ATDC proposed transaction, has been above 1.5% since January. The initial proposal feels like a low-ball that wouldn\u2019t get done on the open market. Could be wrong, will leave it to the MakerDAO hive mind to sort it.  On interest rates for the Note(s), we would welcome further discussion on what the Maker community objectives and expectations are with respect to emerging market, real world assets.  A less empirical, more intuitive take: Maybe the guarantee from Al Hail excites other senior lenders, but seems like a messy dynamic that wouldn\u2019t benefit MakerDAO as it would those with local knowledge of gulf politics, finance, and general norms. The prospect of MakerDAO forcing compliance of a credit guarantee by the UAE Royal Family in a gulf court is almost laughable to consider. I could be deeply off-base here. As you\u2019ve mentioned, ATDC would cover third-party credit analysis. This brings some comfort, but it suffers from incentive design as an \u201cissuer pays\u201d model.  After greenlighting, we were planning to engage an unrelated, third-party consulting firm to perform a credit assessment. We could use Houlihan Lokey or another firm acceptable to the RWA Core Unit. Additionally, the credit representatives from the RWA Core Unit would have the ability to direct the assessment to be performed. As Christian points out below, there are advantages to using English law for the Note(s) and Al Hail Guarantee. OPM has had an initial conversation with Latham and Watkins\u2019 UAE office on the enforceability of an English law guarantee against a company owned by a member of the Royal family. We are arranging a call with Christian and Latham to review this analysis.  You note that the AED:USD risk does not exist as AED are pegged to the dollar. However, is there a plan to mitigate the EGP:USD currency risk?  The EGP portion of the amounts paid under the Services Agreement to ATDC will be reinvested back into the efficiency projects to finance the plant improvements described in this MIP6. The majority of the savings under the Services Agreement are paid to ATDC by EEHC in USD to its bank account. This represents 65% of the savings.  Good data point. Where can it be independently verified? Though past performance is not indicative of future performance, it\u2019s the best predictor we\u2019ve got. If performance was steady through the Arab Spring, that says something. With that said, what worries me is the unique salvo of macro events converging on the Egyptian government and, by extension, EEHC, at the moment. As many macro-savvy community members are aware, the Egyptian government subsidizes energy and foodstuffs, an example of which is wheat, for the benefit of its citizens. Since 1989, subsidized bakeries have provided 20 loaves of bread for one Egyptian Pound. Because Egypt imports 86% of its wheat from Ukraine/Russia, its government will have to either work the higher commodity prices into the budget (increase the fiscal deficit) or renege on this 30-year promise. Anwar Sadat attempted to remove bread subsidies in 1977, only to change tack when violent riots started. The Arab Spring was also, in some part, catalyzed by high food prices. The sovereign budget accounts for bread prices of $255 per tonne; prices on futures markets are near $400 per tonne. The adjustment to the federal budget will be equivalent to 0.3% of GDP. This article by The Economist summarizes the issue nicely.  Attached are additional data points on electricity prices and KFW financing of Egyptian power plants.  Phasing out electricity subsidies86  -  Read-Only22960\u00d7540 42.6 KB   Phasing out electricity subsidies86  -  Read-Only22960\u00d7540 217 KB   Phasing out electricity subsidies 3960\u00d7540 344 KB  In addition, find below a chart showing how Egypt has been steadily increasing its Foreign reserves over the last ten years.  Graph for ATDC936\u00d7546 50.3 KB  The Egyptian government has set very aggressive targets to grow its economy and attract foreign investments. It also is executing a plan to lift the subsidies on electricity and fuel. The original plan for completely lifting electricity subsidies was 2022. Due to the pandemic, the government extended the time frame for lifting these subsidies until 2025. This was reported in Egypt Today magazine on June 9, 2020 as stated by the Minister of Electricity in Egypt. The data provided on the electricity rates of EEHC came from the annual reports of EEHC.  As of a Reuters article dated 3/8/2022, EGP-denominated government bonds have been decimated, trading in the 63-66 cent range, an all-time low. Investors are demanding a 980 bps spread over like-duration US treasuries, an all-time high. For those unfamiliar, a spread is the increase yield beyond a \u201crisk-free rate\u201d that an investor demands for holding an asset. Spreads blow out as the perceived risk of holding an asset increases. Finally, credit default swaps on Egyptian sovereign debt are at all time highs. CDS on five-year Egyptian sovereign debt. As per this chart which tracks Egyptian CDS prices,, it appears these fundamentals have since improved. I am not a macro expert but this does strike me as a uniquely bad time to be making five year bets, for which we are paid 1-2.5% on a country with a non-trivial chance of popular revolt. We could just buy a five-year treasury and call it a day.  On interest rates for the Note(s), we would welcome further discussion on what the Maker community objectives and expectations are with respect to emerging market, real world assets.  So we are potentially funding through 2027, so we need to think about our take-out financing as of 2026. We need to hope that either A) the party that refinances our loan is comfortable with three years remaining on the contract term or B) the contract gets renewed/extended over the course of our loan. So, in other words, more risk. @christiancdpetersen Please mansplain to me if I am oversimplifying.  ATDC proposes to have amortization to pay down principal on each interest payment date to reduce risk over the term of the Notes. We suggest approximately USD 750K (principal +interest) payable quarterly. ",

Is there any penalty or impact on the future cash flows in the event of a delay or inability to complete the project?  The Walidia project has been ongoing for four years. All major works on the plant have been completed and all contractual obligations that are subject to penalties have been met. Payments from the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company have been steadily received by ATDC over the last four years. All future work, which will be done to further improve the performance of the plant, increase its fuel efficiency and cashflows while reducing carbon emissions.  Also, is there any relationship between Al Hail Holding LLC and ATDC? And given this is not a bank or government guarantee, how can we get further comfort around the corporate guarantee from Al Hail which is a private company with no public ratings or track record? Thanks  Al Hail is the majority shareholder in ATDC. The company is a major group established in 2006 and has grown into a leading investment business in the UAE with a diversified investment portfolio across sectors like finance, real estate and energy. A governmental guarantee from the Egyptian Ministry of Finance is in place under the Service Agreement and is effective for the life of the project term. The value of the guarantee is $116 million.

We appreciate the enthusiasm for this project.     christiancdpetersen:   The incubating Legal and Transactional Services core unit is pleased to provide the following questions/observations to this MIP## (MIP6?). Please note that these are high level questions/observations based on the information provided to date. A more comprehensive diligence and analysis of the overall transaction, contracts, cash-flow, etc. is required to form a complete picture and form an educated opinion.  As noted elsewhere, we will need to diligence the credit profile of Al-Hail. We assume that the guarantee will be a standard English law guarantee with customary waivers of defenses etc. We will want to ensure that Al Hail can be sued and that any claims against Al Hail and ADT are enforceable in UAE. To confirm if the service fees payable by EEHC are denominated in USD.     The guarantee is a standard form of an unconditional English-law guarantee provided by Latham & Watkins, but is subject to further internal review by Al Hail and ATDC. OPM will arrange a call with Latham\u2019s UAE office to take Christian through the enforceability analysis. We can pursue obtaining written advice if this MIP6 is approved. The service fees payable by EEHC are paid in EGP and USD. The EGP portion of the fees are reinvested into the plant pursuant to the Services Agreement to make improvements in efficiency.     OasisProTeam:  ATDC receives a share of the plant\u2019s cost savings, and such USD savings will be deposited into a pledged ADGM cash account       christiancdpetersen:   If not, we will need to understand the FX risk associated with conversion.  To confirm whether EEHC pays ADT in Egypt or in the ADGM.     The USD payments today are transferred directly by the client to ATDC\u2019s account. Yes, it is possible to have them directed to the account to be pledged in ADGM. All that ATDC has to do is to instruct the client to send the funds to the new account.     OasisProTeam:  and such USD savings will be deposited into a pledged ADGM cash account       christiancdpetersen:   Are the carbon credits part of the collateral guarantee? It is unclear.    The carbon credits are not currently part of the collateral package. Any Egyptian carbon credits pledged would need review by local counsel to (i) understand the legal framework under which the carbon credits were issued in Egypt and (ii) verify that an enforceable security interest granted in such carbon credits would be enforceable. ATDC signed an agreement with EnKing International a company that specializes in helping companies register their projects in voluntary carbon registries. The company is working with EnKing to register the Walidia project in the Global Carbon Council (GCC) registry. Once this process is completed, they agreed to buy the already generated carbon credits from 2019 till end of 2021 at a price of $4.75 per credit. The remaining credits that will be generated between now and the end of the project will be sold onto carbon exchanges. 15% of the proceeds from the sale will go to EnKing and ATDC will receive 85%. ATDC has till July this year to file its registration application with GCC. By the time the company registers the project, it is expected that the price of carbon credits will increase. According to EnKing\u2019s estimates, the price per credit can range between $6 and $15. At ADGM a new carbon exchange will be setup by Air carbon Exchange (ACX).     OasisProTeam:  MakerDAO\u2019s legal counsel, North Lakes Legal PLLC, would review such documentation and set up the ADGM entity with assistance from Latham & Watkins if necessary.       christiancdpetersen:   It would be helpful if OPM (or Latham) could do the actual work to establish the ADGM entity. I am happy to provide guidance, suggestions, support, etc., but this should not be a direct activity of North Lakes Legal.    We have revised this in the MIP6 to reflect this comment and we will ask Latham to set up the legal entity.     OasisProTeam:  (3) taking all actions deemed necessary to perfect any security interest (by way of security transfer or title transfer)       christiancdpetersen:   I would expect the borrower to complete the steps necessary to perfect the security interest. Of course, the incubating LTS will make assess from the Maker perspective.    Yes, that is what we anticipate as well. OPM and ATDC would request advice from Latham and Egyptian local counsel. We meant that North Lakes Legal could review and comment on the process, legal issues and advice provided by counsel. We have already requested advice on security interests in Egypt.     OasisProTeam:  taking any and all other actions deemed reasonable and necessary to complete the transaction described herein       christiancdpetersen:   The incubating LTS is not a party to the transaction, so this is a bit broad.    We have removed this from the MIP6.     OasisProTeam:  including the engagement of internationally-recognized legal counsel to advise for the benefit of MakerDAO       christiancdpetersen:   Yes, subject to external firm due diligence requirements. This remains an on-going challenge, but I continue to push firms forward on this issue.    As long as there is no conflict of interest, OPM can use Latham to look into regulatory and legal issues for Christian.     OasisProTeam:  Please see the table below for estimates of the costs and revenues estimate for the remaining term of the Services Agreement.       christiancdpetersen:   Does the financial model contemplate any tax on the service fee payments made by EHCC to ADT? This might be a withholding tax payable by EHCC or a tax on ADT itself in Egypt.    No taxes have been withheld or deducted by the client on all of the payments received over the last four years. No withholding tax is applicable since ATDC is a foreign entity. ",

My high level take away is that your team is looking to MakerDAO for education and to determine for you key commercial terms of both deals. This is not our role.  I am not enthusiastic about diverting the precious time and resources of our CUs to comb through all of this information without there being a pre-diligenced and comprehensive term sheet, structure, etc. etc. proposed for us to react to.

                    "content": "ATDC is working on developing technologies that will not only apply to conventional fossil fuels but also to green fuels. Our plan dictates to rollout the products first using conventional fuels for energy generation. This is followed by using the same technologies to utilize green fuels such as hydrogen and green ammonia. A case in point, our gas turbine combustor technology is being funded at a bench scale level by the US Department Of Energy (DOE) to develop the combustion system using green ammonia as a fuel. As a result of our success in phase I, DOE awarded us phase II. To this effect, a major part of the loan will be allocated to complete the development and the rollout of the new technologies and get them ready for commercial use.  Once the green fuels are commercially feasible, ATDC will be in a leading position to apply its new technologies using the green fuels. Please find below a short summary for each item of the use of funds areas.   Efficiency improvement; This constitutes the application of further conventional solutions in the plant with the objective of increasing further the efficiency in the plant especially at part load levels.   Solar thermal technology; In power plants, not all generated steam is utilized to generate electricity. A sizable portion of the steam is used to satisfy some consumers in the plant. ATDC identified the need to develop a solution that would not require firing fossil fuel to generate the steam. This will be accomplished by the solar thermal system. The latter will generate the required steam from sun rays and as a result reduce the fossil fuel consumption and in turn the carbon emissions. The company intends to build a plant that will produce the solar thermal petals and spread their use in the industrial and power generation markets.   Gas turbines require air filtration systems to remove dust particles from the air before entering the compressor of the gas turbine. ATDC identified the need to develop a high efficiency filtration system that will help the gas turbines maintain their efficiency. To this effect, the company will be building up a high efficiency gas turbine filtration factory to produce these filters.   As part of the work ATDC done in Walidia power plant in Egypt is to develop a strategy for improving the combustion efficiency in the boilers. It was recognized that if the combustion efficiency is poor the carbon emissions are very high. To this effect, ATDC developed a new High Efficiency Advanced Telescopic (HEAT) burner system that improves significantly the combustion efficiency in boilers and as such reduce the carbon emission. The funds allocated for this project is to complete the development and apply the new technology in new energy improvement projects in large steam boilers whether for power generation or for industrial applications.   ATDC recognized that the gas turbine applications market is growing and will continue to grow. The company developed a new disruptive combustion technology (T-fired combustion technology) that will enhance the performance of the gas turbines while at the same reduce pollutants emissions from the turbines. The funds allocated will be demonstrate the technology at a 16 MW level prior to its application at various scale levels.    PastedGraphic-21824\u00d71076 94.3 KB  ",

                    "content": "RWF is comfortable issuing the following for the benefit of MakerDAO token holders who may participate in the active green-light poll. Please keep in mind that this only my opinion. I have sought to take: A) The facts presented in the initial MIP-6, the forum discussion, and the onboarding call B) My understanding of how the world works C) What I understand the priorities of the protocol to be and combine them into a coherent recommendation. Token holders should always DYOR\u2014 surely I\u2019ll have mischaracterized some things. Recommendation: No greenlight. As structured, this opportunity appears to provide poor risk-adjusted return to the protocol. The proposed return is below the risk-free rate (US treasuries) of similar duration. The threat of geopolitical tail-risk and a convoluted recovery process is non-trivial. Putting the specifics around terms aside, I further believe that there is a fundamental mismatch between the nature of this collateral and the needs of MakerDAO over the long-term. This is as much if not more a matter of MakerDAO idiosyncrasy than it is a criticism of the proposed assets. For RWAs to be profitable and provide value to token holders, MakerDAO should be focusing on wholesale-esc relationships that scale. I.e. build a commercial/legal/technical structure once, underwrite the underwriter, and drip additional funding to them as the vault seasons and the underwriter performs. MakerDAO ought not to be a jack of all trades and master of none. It wants to empower specialist lenders to execute in their niches, not to build out a bloated and ineffective credit underwriting department. The asset, esoteric, energy-related, and foreign, will be VERY complicated to diligence and because it is a one-off project ($35MM), as opposed to a more programmatic arrangement with a manager, will be difficult to scale.   Opportunities:     Diversification/Social: Emerging market exposure.      Greening: Potential reduction of fossil fuels reliance in Egypt.      Safe-ish: De-Facto Egyptian sovereign debt, also guaranteed by UAE royals.      Infrastructure: Establish a lending practice in Africa/Middle East      Platform: Opportunity to partner with a new arranger, Oasis Pro Markets. OPM may offer an appealing tokenization solution for real world assets and is one of a few entities to obtain an Alternative Trading System (ATS) license. This allows its subscribers to trade blockchain securities.      Threats:     Sharpe Ratio: The return on the proposed five-year note is below that of a two-year US treasury, one of the safest assets on earth. The assets pose more risk, as proposed, than MakerDAO is compensated for.      Geopolitical Risk: Egyptian government debt is experiencing contemporary (and maybe temporary) deterioration. Egypt is one of three countries that the IMF is currently focused on.      Supply Chain Tail Risk: Ukraine War has strained Egypt\u2019s subsidization policy and presents risk of social dissent due to increasing wheat, fertilizer, and energy prices.      Greening risk: Though supporting more efficient use of fossil fuels (and thus reduction in GHG) is definitely net good, MakerDAO dollars are ultimately funding the continued operation of heavy fuel oil boilers + turbines. I will leave it to token holders to guage this one.      Scaling Risk: opportunity is a one-off and does not have the legs to scale. (No infrastructural leverage)      OPM will be a great future partner for MakerDAO, but it is not through this proposed formulation that the most productive version of that partnership is born. ",

Although you specify that the post outlines your own personal opinion on the MIP, I am assuming that this has been shared by @williamr as Facilitator of RWF-001 and is the best representation of the Core Unit\u2019s opinion. I believe the post gives token holders the most transparent view on the collateral, including opportunities and threats that a greenlight vote would carry. I have witnessed the interactions between RWF-001 and the Proponent (@OasisProTeam) and I can attest that the process has been transparent, fair, professional, and highly engaged by both parties. As customary, the decision remains with the token holders. On a purely financial standpoint, LOVE\u2019s recommendation would be to vote against greenlighting the collateral. In addition, I believe that the ad hoc nature of the deal - vs. a more programmatic relationship that can be progressively scaled by MakerDAO - would not be the most efficient use of the DAO\u2019s resources given the complex negotiations that any real-world deal entails. However, given the current inception phase of Maker\u2019s real-world asset program, it is with each token holder to weigh non-financial benefits (e.g. publicity, impact, strategic relationships with borrowers and intermediaries, etc.) against the threats outlined by TeeJ in the post above. RWF-001 should provide the best possible support to the counterparty along the collateral onboarding process in case the community decides to vote in favour. From a procedural standpoint, I believe OPM has provided all the required information to take an informed decision. Regards, Luca ",

OPM\u2019s approach to presenting the ATDC transaction, as well as India Power, is to offer a financing opportunity that provides the Maker community with green energy, emerging markets real-world assets, backed by guarantees and a listing venue for the securities for price discovery. This financing is structured as notes to create potential liquidity and transparent valuation to the Maker community through the creation of secondary market on the OPM ATS. ATDC is flexible on the interest rate for the notes. In a traditional finance transaction, rates are set closer to the actual funding. If the community is prioritizing yield over obtaining green, emerging markets assets, then the interest rate discussion should happen closer to the actual funding, as is the case in traditional finance. To address some of the recent questions and commentary, below are a few salient points from the ATDC MIP6 and the posted responses to questions above:   While this MIP6 is for a $35mm financing, the opportunity to fund additional green projects in Egypt and other countries in the Middle East could be as much as $500mm - $1bn.   The risk to Egypt is mitigated by a pledged cash account in ADGM and the guarantee of Al Hail Holding, the investment company of a member of the royal family that had $500 million equivalent of AED (which is pegged to the U.S. dollar)   Item 14 of the MIP6 details the proposed legal structure and Christian\u2019s comments highlight the work that we need to do if this MIP6 is approved.  That process has begun and we had a call with UAE counsel to discuss the enforceability of the guarantee against Al Hail and there is a process to enforce against a UAE entity.   While ATDC\u2019s projects may appear initially to support a fossil fuel plant, they are reducing carbon emissions while moving toward sustainable forms of energy. Egypt is committed to installing solar power plants in the upcoming years. ATDC produced the following chart showing the progression from fossil fuel plants to green energy sources.    PastedGraphic-21824\u00d71076 94.3 KB   This MIP6 was submitted by Oasis Pro, solely as an advisor to ATDC. Oasis Pro will not receive any of the proceeds of the funding and is not a party to the transaction \u2013 this transaction benefits the Maker community and ATDC. Oasis Pro as advisor and as a provider of a secondary trading venue would receive customary investment banking advisory fees and trading commissions. It is unclear how the ownership of Oasis Pro relates to this transaction.  ",

In doing so, we reflect on the inputs of the MIP6 applicant and other Forum contributors. We have undertaken a professional assessment based on the facts and information provided to date. That professional assessment may mean that the recommendation is no. That is part of a healthy process. In terms of the particular transaction, the Maker community should also focus on transaction execution. As OPM itself notes above,     OasisProTeam:  Christian\u2019s comments highlight the work that we need to do if this MIP6 is approved   I can confirm that this statement is accurate. While I have not financed a transaction in Egypt, I have utilized the ADGM as a situs for a SPV lender and I have advised on transactions in other African jurisdictions, including Mozambique, South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, Uganda, Nigeria, and Ghana. I have also financed power projects of all types - coal, heavy fuel oil, nat gas, wind, solar and nuclear. So my professional opinion is based on some level experience. Setting aside the risk/reward allocation identified by @teej and myself in earlier postings, I am reasonably confident that the transaction\u2019s execution will be a challenge (not insurmountable, but time consuming). The Maker token holders have the responsibility to make an informed decision whether to green light a transaction. We have use our best efforts to provide the Maker token holders with tools to make such a decision. If the transaction is greenlit, which decision is entirely within the discretion of the Maker token holders, this approval does not mean a transaction is easily or rapidly executable. The Maker community will need to understand this as well. If you have a substantive comment or comments, I would be pleased to discuss them with you directly, in the weekly office hours, or via the Forum. Perhaps there is something we missed. Otherwise your posting does not contribute to a discussion on the merits of the MIP6. ",

First of all, as a CU we have deep respect for counterparties like @OasisProTeam that engage teams like ours in a professional and open manner from the start. I believe the relationship is of mutual professional treatment and has been like that since its inception. Second, on process which relates to points covered by fellow professionals @luca_pro and the rest of the RWF team:  Team members are assigned to diligence MIP6 applications at the different stages of the process: pre-greenlight and post-greenlight poll. During pre-greenlight the work is primarily on process guidance to counterparties (see approved MIP67). During pre-greenlight, team members are exposed to materials and documentation provided by the counterparty which allows team members to gain insights into the materiality of the deal but also on early identification of possible risks in its delivery, if/when greenlit. Where no industry expertise exists in the core CU to professionally assess a deal, grantees with the required industry experience are engaged to apply their experience in the assessment. Core team members are, in that capacity, \u201cbuddied up\u201d with experts to summarise their outputs. This was the case in this OPM pre-greenlight review. Team members present and discuss their preliminary views (pre-greenlight) on a particular deal with other team members, including myself, as facilitator of the RWF-01 CU. They gather their inputs and then incorporate any feedback into reviews, if applicable. Team members publish that view to the Community of MKR tokenholders and delegates for the sake of information/opinion only, given they had the time to review/analyse the deal with some level of depth prior to its execution.  Team members fully recognise that, at the end of the day, they are not decision-makers. They are engaged by MKR tokenholders as expert contractors to emit a professional view/opinion, whether it is from a credit or legal perspective, on a deal, including its risk adjusted returns and other risks.  But MKR tokenholders are the only eventual decision-makers. This entails MKR tokenholders have every possible right to override any credit recommendation, be it positive or negative, if they deem appropriate, strategic or for any other intrinsic reasons to fit the direction they want the protocol to move towards.  This last point is important. Given expert/experienced teams are engaged to professionally assess and work with counterparties. If the owners of the protocol, i.e. MKR tokenholders, make the decision to override a recommendation, teams are still engaged to assist in the facilitation of its execution in the same professional manner they do DD along with other collateral onboarding teams (CES, Growth, incubating LTS). However, teams are also engaged as consultants to explicitly present their professional opinion on the difficulties/challenges that might be encountered in the execution of that duty of onboarding a collateral/deal, if/when greenlit. The challenges shall be of credit, legal or technological nature. I trust this provides some light into the process, as requested by @luca_pro. Once again, I\u2019d like to respectfully thank @teej and @beedubs for having had a first glance at the deal details and for providing constructive feedback to the @OasisProTeam team to this point.

RWF-001 has worked with @OasisProTeam to provide this deal in the best and most transparent shape for token holders to vote on, as it is their mandate I believe based also on the voted MIP67. Well beyond the forum posts, as I\u2019m sure the counterparty can comment on. The decision to weigh potential benefits and costs is now with each token holder to vote on. I am sure OPM will be the best possible partner on this or any other transaction and help mandated actors to get anything to the finish line, in case the vote will be positive. I might argue yet again for patience, and in favour of a pipeline that includes high quality traditional institutions (not a bad thing) and innovative though less mature protocols (not a GS thing) that will be most probably the ones that will allow Maker to step up. All those opportunities have submitted already either Signal Requests or MIPs following interactions with several core units. I feel for any token holder about recent performance of the governance token, but in the spirit of those who came before me I will leave the Darwinian forces of evolution by natural selection differentiate the builders from the traders. Thank you all for your comments, and especially to @OasisProTeam that has proven to be extremely professional and understanding in dedicating time and effort to package this deal notwithstanding the uncertainty of operating at the frontier of finance.

Again, there is very little in relationship with RWF, as I don\u2019t think RWF put this comment. There is no link with MIP65 (?) or whatever, the subject is clearly this MIP, just providing context. I could have pointed to Untangled which kind of had the same fate. The comment of @teej is just a first pass and can change during a more detailed assessment but I think we can agree it is unlikely (I mean the negative spread with Treasuries is a clear no go). Therefore, it sounds expected to end up in a few week/months with the following status in the CSI file.  RWF risk assessment recommended zero debt ceiling, no further Domain Team work  If I understand the process correctly, this could save a few months for OPM (to go through a MIP or another source of funding). This is my view of being respectful toward prospective borrowers. So even if there is only 20% chance that I\u2019m correct, it make sense to ask the question. So am I correct? Where am I wrong?

My concern is not that the RWA group gives a \u201cno\u201d recommendation or makes suggestions on how a MIP can be improved. That\u2019s the job of an advisor. However, when an asset/project is greenlit and then RWA pooh-poohs it behind the scenes and sits on their hands for months without producing further analysis as is required, they effectively block MKR holders from voicing our positions on a governance poll. As the inordinate delays drag on, people get bored and distracted or excited by the latest shiny collateral type and momentum dies, which seems like the result the RWA team intends. But the RWA CU\u2019s job, like other advisory CUs (e.g., Risk), is to analyze and publicly provide a report, not decide and campaign against projects, which effectively undermines governance by grinding the MIP process to a halt. That shadow gatekeeping disenfranchises MKR holders and harms the DAO.  And isn\u2019t saying \u201cno\u201d at the greenlight stage before something has even passed and been sent to the CUs for analysis the definition of gatekeeping? Remember everyone, we, the MKR holders, decide what happens with Maker and financially benefit if we do well/lose our shirts if we do bad. If we keep quiet about shadow gatekeeping it whittles away MKR sovereignty. ",

When I look at Egyptian Debt spreads, and the term here I don\u2019t think this deal should price much below 3.75-4% on the open market. I think any conflict of interest should also be disclosed (i.e. oasis, etc.) One thing to say about UAE and royal family pledges.   I have family with connections to various royal family in various Arab states.   While there can be issues, GENERALLY you can do a mulitmillion deal on a word and a handshake and know it is going to work.   These people are terrific negotiators, and when it comes to documents, terms will haggle the heck out of you, but when it comes to intent and doing deals - men of their word (usually, in\u2019sh\u2019allah). This is why before you do that handshake you better have had the terms well haggled out. I think getting into this area for what they want as green projects is worthwhile but what I want to know is what rate puts Maker out of their market because I am going to reject anything not 100bps over the 5 yr yield at this point and even then I wonder if this is still a reasonable market price. As to all the other good questions asked. This is just a greenlight poll to pass this off to relevant CUs for their scrutiny so we can go into details after they have had a look. ",

                    "content": "I\u2019ve been following various clean energy proposals on the maker forum for awhile as a long time maker holder (decided to create an account finally after many years!) since the initiative excites me as we see record temperatures happening across the globe. I am interested in the good publicity angle for Maker that the other deals mentioned do not provide with reducing overall CO2 emissions. I think the clean energy push does good in multiple ways beyond just the publicity angle if we price the deal appropriately. It falls directly in line with the Maker clean energy vision while still being a money maker for MakerDao. How do you foresee Maker handling such deals (such as the one above)? I ask this since this proposal was Greenlit in May and did have community support so want to get an update on this particular deal due to it being a first of its kind for us with respect to RWA clean energy deals. From my own pov, this seems like a fairly low risk proposal to test out this kind of initiative given the small relative size, maturity of the project, and overall nature of the deal to see if this a feasible means of financing real world assets beyond the HVB and SocGen style setups. I am of the perspective this deals does more good than harm for the overall perception of maker. I personally would love to see more deals like this come through to further differentiate our platform but I digress. CO2 emissions reduction in various countries is always going to be incredibly appealing since the world will not be able to switch to solar overnight, and we globally share the same environmental impact regardless of jurisdiction. I strongly believe we should be pursuing both kinds of deals (clean energy as well as HVB/SocGen style ones), and not limiting ourselves to do one or the other. With respect to this deal, is there any structure for it (and other green / clean power similar deals) where it seems feasible to you? Do we have any updates on the progress of it since it was greenlit in May? What the expected rate should be (I\u2019d imagine around the 5% range) since it definitely can\u2019t be 2% as originally proposed and when we believe we will understand if and when it will happen? How the discussions with OasisProMarkets have gone and how the implementation of this deal would work? I would love to get an update on all these points now that both HVB and SocGen have both recently passed. Most of the original points against the proposal during green lighting were moreso against the low 2% originally proposed rate, and not necessarily about the initiative itself. Therefore I personally believe with the right rate this deal would garner even more community support given its positive environmental impact while still giving us a good margin. I think being cynical is good, however I do believe we as the maker community should be able to decide if we want to also expand upon Maker\u2019s clean energy vision and make our global contributions to entice larger similar kinds of deals if this one ends up working out. It will also help with providing some level of structure guidance for those future proposals from businesses that seek out similar offerings from us if we have a structure we have tried and tested. Accidentally deleted when I wanted to edit to add one question that just crossed my mind: how much of the RWA team currently believe in the mission of clean energy funding via Maker? ",
