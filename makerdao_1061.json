DOJ alleges that defendant operated \u201ca fraudulent investment scheme and did not use investors\u2019 funds to mine new cryptocurrency, as promised, but instead diverted the funds to cryptocurrency wallets under his control.\u201d He is charged with \u201cconspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit international money laundering. If convicted of all counts, he faces a maximum total penalty of 45 years in prison.\u201d Hopefully the bad actors will still be the target of the DOJ. We all know there are plenty of bad actors out there trying to exploit people under the presumption that they can act with impunity. Maybe now people will be somewhat more deterred to act unlawfully.
