Example: I can vote for my own candidacy on the Growth Experiments committee, so long as I also cast 4 additional votes (a total of 5 votes, as there are 5 open positions on the sub-committee.)  The Protocol Delegation Program was approved in Special Voting Cycle #9b. This program will temporarily delegate a portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to a group of value-aligned protocols. 15 protocols qualify to participate based on total gas fees generated on Optimism in Season 2. You can see the list of top protocols based on gas fees, excluding Quests here: Optimism Project Usage - Custom Period. Protocols that already have 2M OP delegated or that have previously misused OP grants are not eligible for this program. All qualifying protocols must opt-in to participate and will be contacted by the Foundation shortly with additional details. In the event that not all qualifying protocols opt-in, the next qualifying protocol(s) on the list will become eligible. To incorporate other value-aligned protocols that do not meet the above criteria, protocols that are interested in becoming more active in Optimism governance but that do not qualify based on gas fees may self-nominate themselves for an additional spot in the program. The Token House will vote to select up to 8 protocols from the list of valid self-nominations during Special Voting Cycle #9b (which will run from Jan 12th-Jan 18th.) Protocols that wish to self-nominate themselves should post their responses to the below template in this thread by January 11th at 19:00 GMT. This vote will occur via approval voting on Snapshot. Voting is set up such that delegates can place a vote for any number of nominees. This is approval voting, not ranked choice, meaning each selected choice will receive equal voting power. Delegates may not vote for themselves or protocols with which they have a direct affiliation. The 8 nominees with the most votes will be eligible to participate in the program in Season 3.   Protocol name: Name of protocol representative(s) that will serve as delegate(s):  Link to delegate commitment: (if your protocol doesn\u2019t currently have one, you will need to create one) Is your protocol OP Native?:  Was your protocol active in Optimism governance prior to 12/5/22?:  If so, please link to voting history (ie. Snapshot profile, delegate communication thread, twitter threads, etc.):   Why do you want to participate in this program?: Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism ecosystem?:  Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: (Yes / No) Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest:   Protocols may begin posting self-nominations in this thread. Please make sure you have read through the full Protocol Delegation Program proposal before nominating your protocol. ",

Was your protocol active in Optimism governance prior to 12/5/22?: We\u2019ve recently became much more active in Optimism governance by joining weekly delegates calls and trying to provide as much value as we can to the overall process. We\u2019re excited by the experiments that are ongoing, and want to contribute to them more concretely. In the past, we haven\u2019t been focused that much on governance, rather providing value to community via collaborating with OP Labs, launching OP City and educational Optimism onboarding quests inside of Atlantis World, including on tight hackathon style deadlines. Nevertheless, we understand the power of community first values and governance first hand, believe in them wholeheartedly, and wish to contribute more to the governance vertical within Optimism ecosystem more & more from this point on, and indeed before! Engaging and enacting the wishes of the community, as well as contributing to building a strong & trust-minimized system to enable that, is very important to us as one of the many moving parts within the Optimism Collective.   Why do you want to participate in this program?: We love Optimism - be it values, tech, community, ecosystem, and the commitment to public goods. We\u2019re committed to take active part in the future of Optimism.   Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism ecosystem?: We live to make it count, to make social impact that lasts. It\u2019s up to community to decide wether or not we\u2019ve been or would be good stewards of Optimism.   Actions speak louder than words. In the past, we\u2019ve launched public good initiatives such as:   Unchain Fund (raised $10m in donations, including $2.5m from Vitalik Buterin, helped 400k Ukrainians with humanitarian aid); https://twitter.com/unchainfund   ChoiceDAO (coordinating community & capital in the fight for reproductive rights) https://www.choicedao.org/   Kyiv Tech Summit (wartime humanitarian aid focused hackathon, attracted 550+ hackers, brought Vitalik for the first time ever to Ukraine, supported by The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine) https://kyivtechsummit.com, panel with Vitalik https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3krD4lyat0 - Save Pakistan (humanitarian aid initiative ft. novel crypto fundraising via NFTs tied to real-world humanitarian relief items, OP native) https://gov.optimism.io/t/savepakistan-launch-the-first-ever-nfts-tied-to-real-world-humanitarian-relief-goods-on-optimism/4370   Pushing web3 adoption forward on world stage in leading state backed crypto education program with The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, we\u2019d love to see Optimism participate there to educate and onboard millions of people inside of a mass adopted Government app with practical cases. https://twitter.com/atlantis0x/status/1606709980131893248   Atlantis World itself is community-first project that we\u2019ve been building and scaling for almost 2 years while being bootstrapped with grants and revenue, without taking a single dollar from private investors despite multi-million dollar deals being put on the table. We\u2019re exploring creative ways to diversify the network, planning to distribute ownership among our strong & committed community members in the near future with a model that will make sense for the long term. https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-op-city-in-atlantis-world-to-the-optimism-collective/4307   Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: Yes  Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest: None  ",

Was your protocol active in Optimism governance prior to 12/5/22?: Our protocol applied for Phase 1 funding , but due to a focus for our complete revamp of the protocol tokenomics, we could not be clear on how we could be further involved until recently. If so, please link to voting history (ie. Snapshot profile, delegate communication thread, twitter threads, etc.): The links above currently summarise the protocol\u2019s current link to Optimism Goverance. Why do you want to participate in this program?: From a personal point of view, this initiative allows me to be able to represent the DAO that I currently spend most of my time on while at the same time contributing the growth of Optimism. After getting involved with the ParaSwap DAO already for a little over a year now, I believe I have acquired some knowledge from my niche of DeFi DAO Governance that could contribute the growth of the Optimism Ecosystem. For the protocol I am representing, Optimism is the most recent network that we have recently expanded to, and would like to get ourselves more closely aligned in. After our Phase I grant got approved, the DAO underwent months of research to completely alter our tokenomics and emissions policy, resulting in the creation of the PSP 2.0 proposal. Now, the DAO is voting on not only deploying PSP to Optimism to utilise the Grant, but also assist the development of the Optimism ecosystem through development grants, such as the development of dApps on the Optimism ecosystem, or research into the Social Escrow system, which in my opinion aligns well with the Optimistic Vision, as I will explain in the next section. Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism ecosystem?: ParaSwap is a middleware and aggregator. Thus, it is essential for us to maintain good communication with all of the protocols that we connect to, as well as the ones that decide to integrate us for their aggregation options. This places ParaSwap in a position where not only do we wish to acquaint ourselves with all major DeFi protocols of the space, but also where the success of these protocols and the Optimism system in general also directly benefits the protocol, leading to a positive sum situation where the protocol is incentivised to ensure the sustainable growth of the Optimism ecosystem. However, I think that our greatest alignment with the optimism ecosystem extends further than just being an aggregator, and more also into the core principles that are more unique to ParaSwap. In a similar vein to Optimism, ParaSwap has built itself with the long-term vision of being a public good middleware which facilitates access to the web3 space. We believe that ParaSwap not only serves as a public good which assists with the access to the decentralised world, but also helps maintain things decentralised. A good example of this is liquidity pools, where rather than having to concentrate all capital into a recognisable pool, ParaSwap allows pools to be decentralised and be able to compete with each other to provide the best final rates for the users, using whichever innovative approach they decide. One major example of our commitment to become a socially-aligned public goodcan be seen in the recently passed PSP 2.0 proposal from our DAO. In it, we not only decide to allocate 80% of accrued fees to our staked users, but we also experiment with the introduction of a new system in the DeFi space of Social Escrow. The idea of social escrow is to allocate the fees to users that contribute the most positive externalities to the protocol. Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: Yes Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest: Other than my current affiliations for the protocol I am representing on the behalf of, I cannot think of any.

Through continued product releases, partnerships, events, and community building, QiDao has shown its commitment to Optimism. Given the widespread integrations QiDao has in the space, it\u2019s safe to say success at both projects is aligned. Since launching on Optimism, the team has not stopped shipping products. LP collateral vaults, $OP lending, and QiDao V2 are the latest product offerings to hit QiDao Optimism. Others on the way include custom timelocks, and an upgraded liquidation engine.

Was your protocol active in Optimism governance prior to 12/5/22?: If so, please link to voting history (ie. Snapshot profile, delegate communication thread, twitter threads, etc.):  We previously submitted a proposal for the upcoming round of OP grants (hasn\u2019t gone to a snapshot vote yet) and had various calls with OP Labs and active Optimism community members to get feedback and advice.    Why do you want to participate in this program?:  Optimism is a key component of KyberSwap\u2019s plans for 2023 and beyond. Our team believes that we can create the most impact if we are closely aligned with and part of the Optimism collective and community. We also believe Optimism is going to be at the heart of many unprecedented DeFi innovations that would bring a positive impact to the space and we want to help support this development as a delegate. Personally, as part of the team leading KyberSwap\u2019s initiatives related to our own DAO governance and tokenomics, I am interested in being part of how the Optimism collective coordinates public goods for the benefit of all ecosystem participants.    Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism ecosystem?: 1. KyberSwap will bring more users, developers, and Dapps to Optimism  KyberSwap is an OG DEX protocol and aggregator with a good reputation since 2017. As one of the earliest DeFi protocols ever created, we also have many Dapp integrations and a wide partner network in Southeast Asia (SEA). As such, we have the ability to steer a myriad of users and developers towards Optimism. For example, we are already working with popular projects such as QiDAO and Lido Finance to boost liquidity and user adoption on Optimism. KyberSwap is planning to invest substantial manpower, KNC resources, and media budget on Optimism activities as we strongly believe in its vision and potential.  2. Deeper liquidity for Optimism: Swap with the best slippage and rates  As a DEX aggregator, KyberSwap users always enjoy the best rates, and this indirectly brings volume and fees to other DEXes we integrate on Optimism e.g. Velodrome, Curve, BeethovenX, Synapse, Zipswap, Uniswap, and Synthetix. Developers can integrate KyberSwap\u2019s aggregator API to enable the best rates for their own Dapp users on Optimism. E.g. KyberSwap was integrated by DEXTools and DeFiLlama. Moreover, KyberSwap concentrated liquidity pools enable high capital efficiency for LPs; similar to the Uni v3 tick-based AMM but with additional advantages of compounded fees for LPs in a full price range pool and anti-sniping/JIT that protects earnings. KyberSwap liquidity pools are often within the top 3 highest volume contributors on Optimism without OP grants so far and with much less TVL compared to other DEXes on Optimism.  3. Investments in the Optimism Ecosystem and Community, especially in SEA  KyberSwap has a strong community and partner network in the SEA region. Pre-Covid, Kyber ran the largest monthly Ethereum meet-up events in Vietnam and is an active member of the Ethereum community in Singapore. We are long-time members of DeFi Alliance DAO and Asia DeFi Network. We have the experience to invest in and grow the Optimism community at the local grassroots level, especially in SEA. KyberSwap\u2019s past involvement in Ethereum and DeFi hackathons and bounties have resulted in the launch of popular DeFi projects such as InstaDapp, 1inch, and ZapperFi.  Kyber Ventures actively invests in DeFi/GameFi Dapps and builders and this would apply to Optimism-based projects too. This would help to grow Optimism\u2019s Dapp ecosystem, which would in turn result in a rise in users, volume, and liquidity.  4. Aligned with the Optimistic vision  KyberSwap\u2019s vision to provide a liquidity hub for the decentralized economy complements Optimism\u2019s vision to create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace. KyberSwap\u2019s DEX aggregator and API is a public good for any trader and Dapp to swap and access any token for their decentralized, on-chain liquidity needs. At the same time, KyberSwap enables any liquidity provider to create liquidity pools on Optimism and directly earn from their positive contribution to the ecosystem. Our team has deep experience with coordinating large scale DeFi projects as evident from KyberSwap\u2019s initiation and launch of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and WBTC DAO with the support of a wide network of DeFi partners. As the first ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin, WBTC brought Bitcoin liquidity to DeFi and is the most popular wrapped version of Bitcoin in the world today. In 2021, for the benefit of builders in the DeFi space, KyberSwap has also published public research on rollup solutions. We intend to use our expertise and partner relationships to bring a similarly positive impact to the Optimism ecosystem.    Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: (Yes / No)  Yes    Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest:  None apart from our affiliation with KyberSwap.    ",

Snapshot profile, delegate communication thread, twitter threads, etc.):  Why do you want to participate in this program?: We are Optimism\u2019s preeminent native decentralized exchange and have been working since day one to use every lever available to us to help guide Optimism to success. The nature of our work gives us a perspective on building on Optimism that few teams or individuals can match, and being delegates will enable us to channel this insight toward policies that we believe will enable Optimism to meet its objectives. Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism ecosystem?: The core principles underlying the Vision are foundational to our protocol. Velodrome is a public good: we raised no money, gave virtually all of our votepower away to ecosystem protocols, OP Labs, prospective users, and Optimism airdroppees, and are laying out initiative after initiative intended to broaden stakeholdership of our protocol and of Optimism more generally. We structured Velodrome to allow anyone seeking to build to bootstrap funding without appealing directly to private capital and for veVELO lockers to benefit from economic activity in the ecosystem. Why did we do this? We believe that the promise of decentralized finance is not to enrich the few but to freely provide accessible technology facilitating economic activity: a financial Internet, in effect. Optimism is in our view the first true broad-based attempt to make this a reality, and we believe it\u2019s our job to help shepherd this project in its early but critical days.   Do you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: Yes  Please list any anticipated conflicts of interest: Being a decentralized exchange, we interact closely with virtually all protocols on Optimism. Projects looking to draw liquidity or activity for various reasons may want subsidization of their activities on Velodrome. Recusing from all votes that may involve us or other dexes would see us participating in almost no votes. However, the added short-term gains we may realize from any single proposal is heavily outweighed by the importance of ensuring Optimism\u2019s success, and so we are committed to voting in ways that benefit Optimism rather than benefit our protocol, if the two aren\u2019t in alignment.

Was your protocol active in Optimism governance prior to 12/5/22?: No If so, please link to voting history (ie. Snapshot profile, delegate communication thread, twitter threads, etc.): N/A Why do you want to participate in this program?: We love the Optimistic Vision and its mission of building a new digital democratic governance system that balances public goods with the profitability of a great business. We believe that it is precisely this combination that will create an enduring and productive ecosystem. As builders in this ecosystem with a deep interest in governance, we would love to continue supporting and contributing to Optimism to play our part in advancing Optimism\u2019s mission. We see this program and being a protocol delegate as an extension to our commitment in helping reduce friction and improving the governance experience for builders and contributors. We are committed to take an active part in the future of Optimism as a builder regardless of the outcome, however, we would love the opportunity to be a delegate to advocate for the current and future builders of Optimism. Why do you believe your protocol would be a good steward of the Optimism ecosystem?: As builders of Agora (Phase 1 Proposal), we\u2019re active builders in governance with strong interest in improving the ecosystem experience. Our team is composed of deep technical and operating experience across both crypto and tradfi, and as such we have a unique set of experiences and perspectives when it comes to fostering a better ecosystem for builders and contributors. We want to leverage our learnings and lessons working with other major protocols (e.g. ENS, Uniswap, Nouns) to help make Optimism governance a first-class experience for builders, delegates, and all players participating in the ecosystem. Lastly, we view delegates as one of the core user groups of Agora. Active delegates are an important foundation to developing an ecosystem that is truly democratic, and we want to work with other delegates to develop Agora into a product that actively supports their goals and addresses their concerns.

The Protocol Delegation Program will be voted on by the Token House in Special Voting Cycle #9a. Protocols building on Optimism are among its most important stakeholders and they value having a voice in the development of this ecosystem. Throughout Season 1 & 2, protocols have repeatedly expressed this interest by requesting that they be able to self-delegate grants as an means to participate in Token House governance. Self-delegation of grants has historically been discouraged. After much debate, delegates have requested a comprehensive and consistent approach to protocol delegation. This proposal presents a more incentive-aligned way for protocols to get involved in governance in Seasons 3 and 4. The Protocol Delegation Program would delegate a portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to value-aligned protocols based on the objective criteria outlined below. This is an experimental program in which delegations are meant to last two Seasons in total, at which point protocols will need to reaffirm their commitment to Optimism governance via their own treasuries. The continuation of this program for a second Season will be voted on in the Special Voting Cycle following Season 3. If this proposal is approved by the Token House:   A total of 5M OP (or not more 1/3 of the active votable supply, defined as the average executed voting power in Voting Cycle #8) would be delegated across 20 protocols, using idle tokens in the Other Initiatives category of the Governance Fund. Delegations will be made pro-rata at the beginning of each Season, for a maximum of 2 Seasons, according to the below criteria:  total gas fees generated on Optimism during the proceeding Season    Protocol delegations will be capped at the point at which a protocol reaches a total of 2M delegated OP. The cap is on total OP delegated. If a protocol already has 2M OP in delegation, they will not be delegated additional OP through this program. Any OP that is not delegated due to this restriction will be re-allocated on a pro-rata basis among the remaining protocols.   Only protocols that maintain >70% voting participation rate will be eligible for renewal for a subsequent Season of delegation.   Protocol delegates will be subject to the Delegate Code of Conduct. Protocols will be contacted before delegation occurs and given the opportunity to opt-out if they aren\u2019t able to meet the requirements or do not wish to participate. Any protocol that the Token House finds to be in severe violation of the Delegate Code of Conduct will have their Protocol Delegate Program delegations removed.   ",

Many of these protocols already have their communities delegating large amounts of $OP directly to them or to affiliated delegates (not a bad thing). This proposal is basically gifting voting power in addition to the power they have already gathered from the communities. My concern is that non-protocol affiliated delegates currently have no good way to increase their voting power based on merit. Voting power was distributed during the first optimism airdrop and has experienced very little changes since then. Some of the most active and thoughtful delegates have seen their voting power slowly decline due to dilution. I really don\u2019t know what a solution would be, but if the Collective values non-affiliated delegates it would be great to have a similar merit-based program for the governance community to counteract the dilution this will introduce as well as create a growth path for actively participating delegates.

                    "content": "As I expressed during the Governance Call following the release of the Course Correction proposal, I believe that having total gas fees generated as the core criteria by which OP is (pro-rata) delegated to protocols on Optimism, would result in the under representation of many projects and flawed results. Looking at this dashboard: Optimism - Popular Apps and Project Usage Trends \ud83e\uddee \ud83d\udd34\u2728, you can see that Synthetix is low on the list despite having one of the most active communities on Optimism and being deeply integrated with the rollup. Aside from under representation of some protocols, another thing that stands out to me is that both Uniswap and Galxe would end up with a large amount of delegated OP from this program, despite having hardly any activity and interest in Optimism governance. Uniswap has displayed little interest in Optimism even though they were awarded a large OP allocation from the Phase 0 Governance Fund.  More than 6months have passed and there still hasn\u2019t been an attempt to make use of the OP incentives Uniswap was given (1 Million $OP).  I could go even further by outlining that no one from Uniswap Labs or the Grants Program submitted a proposal for the use of OP from that allocation until there was public pressure on Twitter for them to do so.  They seemed quite disinterested in Optimism governance back then, and based on the lack of a plan for the OP they hold, it seems they still lack interest.  Therefore I believe delegating a large portion of OP to Uniswap Protocol, based on a single metric of gas fees generated last season, would be a pretty big waste. Galxe is a project which has lead to a great amount of growth and usage on Optimism, but does not have significant resources and infrastructure deployed to Optimism like many DeFi protocols do. So despite successfully onboarding many users to Optimism through the Quests campaign, it would be unjust for Galxe to have a major portion of OP delegated to them, from this program, without sharing the same exposure that other protocols have to Optimism. In general I think that the Protocol Delegation Program would end in suboptimal and flawed results under the current criteria. Gas fees generated, on its own, don\u2019t properly represent the depth of alignment that protocols have with Optimism and would certainly need to be used in combination with other metrics for it to be effective in achieving the goals of this program. I think if used in combination, the following metrics would lead to fairer results:  Total Value Locked in the protocol Is the project Optimism native (deployed on OP and ETH mainnet only)? Does the Protocol conduct its Governance on Optimism? Gas Fees Generated by the protocol  I think the above criteria could be weighted and combined to produce much better results for Optimism Governance and fulfill the purpose of the Protocol Delegation Program. Eager to hear feedback from the OP foundation and other delegates on the above idea! ",

                    "content": "    millie:  Thank you for the info, but from the looks of it the newly formed Uniswap Foundation has essentially outsourced the program to projects which already have their own OP allocations.   To clarify, three programs are competing in Uniswap\u2019s in-house OP LM program. Of those three, Arrakis Finance did not receive an allocation from OP governance. Their solo application was rejected. xToken and Gamma did receive a grant from OP governance. I don\u2019t think you are characterizing the Uniswap OP LM program fairly. The Uniswap Foundation didn\u2019t blindly \u201coutsource\u201d this. They created a competitive, staged program that passed their governance process with community feedback. UF\u2019s program includes an analytics period (just awarded) where the LM programs are scrutinized before moving forward to the next stage. This is exactly the kind of due diligence many who participate in the OP governance process have been asking for. Especially in regard to incentivizing liquidity. That due diligence was prioritized over expediency.     millie:  I have no issue with that but I\u2019m not convinced that they care about Optimism any more as a result of it since they decided not to host the LM program through their own interface, which would have obviously been far more beneficial to Optimism and reached a much wider audience.   Uniswap running their LM program would require them to manage the LP positions. That management could lead to wildly different results based on strategy. That is why they created a competitive program to manage the distribution of OP rewards. Uniswap heavily promoted the program on Twitter.. Likewise, all three managers had robust participation in the grant for the number of rewards allocated. You can read about some of the results here     millie:  Looking at this dashboard: Optimism - Popular Apps and Project Usage Trends   , you can see that Synthetix is low on the list despite having one of the most active communities on Optimism and being deeply integrated with the rollup. Aside from under representation of some protocols, another thing that stands out to me is that both Uniswap and Galxe would end up with a large amount of delegated OP from this program, despite having hardly any activity and interest in Optimism governance.   I do feel it\u2019s important to point out that Uniswap allocated 0 OP of a 1m OP grant towards participating in OP governance. In contrast, Synthetix self-delegated 2m OP they received from the OP partner fund.  That is your right to do so under the terms of Layer 0 rules and your internal SIP, but attempting to punish Uniswap for not \u201chaving any activity or interest in Optimism governance\u201d when they had zero votes is not fair. The whole point of the Protocol Delegation Program is to allocate funds for governance to the projects actually building on the platform. Uniswap should absolutely have a voice in Optimism governance based on its credentials, usage, and relevance with DeFi. ",

Due to the gas costs of opening UniV3 positions it becomes difficult for small LPs to be active in those programs, but on Optimism that is not the case. I also like all three of the projects which had the Uniswap Liquidity Mining program outsourced to them but there is no doubt that Uniswap offering the LM program on their interface, would have a much greater impact on participation. Any way I will voice these opinions in Uniswap\u2019s Governance Forum but I think it essentially boils down to Uniswap not wanting to allocate dev resources to this initiative. Happy to be proven wrong on that. On a side note, for anyone who has misconceptions about the UniV3 staker and whether it\u2019s viable for permissionless Liquidity Mining, I suggest listening to my discussion with Guil Lambert on the topic. We go into great depth about it\u2019s advantages and why there is a lot of misinformation about the effectiveness of the staking contract.

Throughout Season 1 & 2, protocols have repeatedly expressed this interest by requesting that they be able to self-delegate grants as an means to participate in Token House governance. Self-delegation of grants has historically been discouraged. After much debate, delegates have requested a comprehensive and consistent approach to protocol delegation. This proposal presents a more incentive-aligned way for protocols to get involved in governance in Seasons 3 and 4. The Protocol Delegation Program would delegate a portion of idle OP from the Governance Fund to value-aligned protocols based on the objective criteria outlined below. This is an experimental program in which delegations are meant to last two Seasons in total, at which point protocols will need to reaffirm their commitment to Optimism governance via their own treasuries.

Volume should be the more relevant metric here. Whether or not they\u2019re optimizing their OP distribution should be analyzed on a objective basis.

I don\u2019t think Optimism native protocols should get any advantages with this program.

Never will be a fan of \u201cnativism\u201d. Nor do I think protocols that conduct governance on OP should get any advantage. The governance activity could be superfluous and inconsequential. Many protocols don\u2019t have the resources to wholesale move their governance to Optimism. Many would have a conflict of interest in doing so. As @BP_Gamma stated, I think volume is a better metric (or even fee generation) than TVL. TVL is just parked funds, with no description about what it\u2019s actually doing or how it\u2019s being used. Certainly willing to entertain more objective metrics when evaluating protocol delegation rewards. But as I have stated many times before, I would avoid subjective assessments of a protocol\u2019s \u201cloyalty\u201d or \u201ccommitment\u201d, These kinds of things are poisonous for governance.

They deserve it and they should have a large voice in governance. Isn\u2019t that the point of this program? To give protocols that are the backbone of Optimism voting power? Right now, they have zero voting power. They have taken very little OP for their size (including sub-projects that work on them, like Gamma, xToken, Revert) compared to some other projects here. They pledged it all to incentives. They are a power player in crypto and DeFi. They\u2019re critical to the success of Optimism competing against other Layer 2s. They have little to no voice in Optimism governance right now. They never got a committee spot. Velodrome is well-qualified for a delegation here as well, being they pushed, I think, all of their allocations (both from op labs and governance) to incentives. Velodrome has what? 200k OP allocated to them? That\u2019s pretty small for a protocol of their size on this platform. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but Synthetix has 2.1m OP voting right now, with another 1.28m stuck on a multi-sig. Giving them a vote power of nearly 3.4m when fixed.

                    "content": "    StrategicReserve:  With all due respect, I think the criteria is fair to Uniswap and many other protocols based on their utility and usage.   Fairness doesn\u2019t enter into this. That this is an arbitrary judgment of fairness is probably beside the point. Let me explain: I was an early, conspicuous, and hopefully consequential proponent of enfranchising protocols as crucial, often overlooked stakeholders directly shaping Optimism\u2019s ecosystem. I won\u2019t rehash all the arguments I\u2019ve made on this point, but I do want to emphasize two major things. We want to give protocols votepower because they have unmatched, necessary perspective on the current needs of Optimism from development, strategic, and bizdev standpoints, and because they represent the existing and future developer community\u2019s interests. This is logic similar to why we encourage users to delegate their votepower to others who best reflect their priorities. Getting the most invested, most plugged-in, and most impactful of these voices involved is good for Optimism, and we want to design this delegation program to maximize that outcome. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this in the first place \u2013 to make Optimism succeed as an ecosystem and as an organization through active, informed collaboration. What I haven\u2019t been saying is that protocols or projects are owed votepower simply by deploying on Optimism or being native to Optimism, nor have I been saying that protocols signal more value to governance by operating effectively or providing existing utility to users. Remember that several major protocols are immutable and autonomous \u2013 their function doesn\u2019t even require an active team! So weighting votes by a blunt protocol-level operating metric such as volume or otherwise appealing to the notion of the biggest and best protocols having the biggest voice is missing the entire point of this exercise. Let\u2019s say a bridge protocol deployed everywhere had twice as much volume as all other protocols. What does giving them votepower have to do with why we are giving protocols a vote? What would Optimism possibly have to gain by giving this bridge an outsized voice, and why should we consider them the best representative of developers as a stakeholder class? What opinion can we really expect them to have about where to take Optimism? Now, where protocols\u2019 effectiveness, operating scale, etc. do become relevant is in grants. A good grant-issuing team would understand the relative strengths of different protocols and know to allocate grants to those protocols. So if some protocol like that major bridge provides the best means of meeting some objective outlined in a grant, we want to make sure our resources are going toward it more than toward other protocols. That\u2019s when we care about, e.g., whether Uniswap gets more volume than Kyber on a pool. And guess who we want to help make this determination \u2013 and make sure that we\u2019re chasing the right things in general: that\u2019s right, protocols that are heavily involved in the ecosystem, not necessarily those protocols that happen to be the best means to particular ends. An incumbent multichain defi app may be a default option in a nascent ecosystem and a great grantee \u2013 but if there\u2019s no active team to attend to Optimism\u2019s development, it simply doesn\u2019t make sense to give them outsized power over it. It\u2019s not like we owe them anything. Regarding what sorts of criteria to incorporate, I agree with @millie that it\u2019s clearly appropriate to have a multifactorial approach, and I agree with @StrategicReserve that it can, however, be sticky to introduce subjective factors. I don\u2019t have any strong specific recommendations at the moment. But I do want to remind people what we\u2019re aiming for in doing this and encourage more thinking along these lines. The question to be asking is: \u201cwhat sorts of measures can we use to identify the most representative, most beneficial, and most impactful voices among the protocols?\u201d Certainly scale is meaningful here, but there\u2019s much more to it than that.

There\u2019s no reason that something like Quests or Perp Protocol should have outsized influences on Optimism governance. Both of those have varying reasons, but still. I do think there should be a metric to properly support new projects, and ensure that they\u2019re able to obtain a say in governance as well. But then again, this sort of thing can be rewarded medium/long term with better metrics and involvement from these new protocols. It\u2019s also worth considering the fact that many protocols on Optimism have been building, innovating, experimenting, and helping to grow Optimism for so long now. It seems only fair to reward these protocols for their efforts while still allowing newer protocols to have a say in the direction of Optimism and continue innovating. Thanks for bringing up this important issue. I hope the Optimism Foundation and other delegates take your suggestions into consideration. ",

                    "content": "Great to see the active discussion here, you\u2019ve raised a lot of good points that we\u2019d like to address. The main goal of this program is to enable protocols with active usage on Optimism to participate in governance without self-delegating grants. It will also increase the votable supply, the importance of which has been raised by delegates several times. The goal is not to measure the relative value a protocol contributes to the ecosystem. Given the above context, we\u2019d like to get your feedback on an alternate design for the program:   All qualifying protocols would receive the same amount of OP, rather than on a pro-rata basis.  Protocols that are OP Native would receive a small multiplier on the flat rate Protocols that already have an Optimism delegate would receive a multiplier on the flat rate (slightly larger than the OP Native multiplier) Protocols may receive both multipliers, if they meet both criteria  As a reminder, delegations will be made up to a cap of 2M total OP delegated. That means that protocols that already have 2M OP delegated to them are not eligible to receive any additional delegation and protocol delegations will be capped at the point at which they would push a protocol\u2019s delegation above 2M total delegated OP.   We understand your concerns about the criteria to derive the list of qualifying protocols. It\u2019s a challenging problem as most criteria are imperfect. We\u2019ve very intentionally selected the criteria to be:  Applicable across protocols Not easily gameable Objective (to limit the Foundation\u2019s involvement in this process) Simple (given this is a temporary pilot program, lasting a maximum of 2 Seasons)    We suggest the following alternative:  The top 15 protocols, based on gas fees generated on Optimism, will receive delegation (flat distribution with multipliers, as described above). If any qualifying protocols have misused grant funding in the past, they will not be eligible.  Protocols that have not qualified, can self-nominate for one of 8 additional spots in the program. The intent is to broaden the stakeholders that are represented and to take into account factors that cannot easily be quantified or standardized. The Token House would vote on the 8 protocols that are added to the program in Special Voting Cycle #9b. Self-nominations would run from Dec 21st - January 5th.    As in the original design, all qualifying protocols will need to opt into the program in Season 3, creating a delegate commitment and agreeing to abide by the delegate code of conduct. Delegations will not be made without this commitment to participate. Protocols receiving delegation through this program must maintain >70% participation rate to continue to receive delegation in Season 4. Any protocol violating the code of conduct will have their delegation removed.   This program is temporary and will be run for a maximum of 2 Seasons, after which point qualifying protocols will need to maintain their voting power via their own treasuries. Protocols that are active and engaged in the Optimism ecosystem, but that are not part of this program, may still participate in governance via their own treasuries or increase their delegation via other means.   We appreciate your feedback on these proposed changes. Final proposals for the Grants Council and the Protocol Delegation Program will be posted as new posts on the forum later this week. ",

                    "content": "As we know, Optimism is not a simple Ethereum protocol, but a chain on top of Ethereum to host protocols inside. As a direct consequence, the Optimism governance is of interest to the protocols within it (this is not new but good to remember). On the other hand, fair distribution of a token for governance purposes is an extremely difficult task, and releases seen as \u201cfair\u201d no longer exist in this space. No token will be distributed in this process, yes, but meets the same criteria. Regarding this, as members of this governance we have been discussing these topics, mainly the cases of self-delegation and how it provides access to the protocols to have representation without it being an unfair or advantageous game. On this we have a proposal in preparation to discuss in the coming days. Sharing our thoughts Definitely talking about this is a good idea, a way to insert a new type of delegate is fascinating to diversify with differents types of governance participants that can contribute to the enrichment of Optimism ecosystem and its future. For now, this new proposed base of 5M is a good start to offer to projects deployed in Optimism participation. According to Defillama, Optimism currently has 36 protocols with a TVL above $1M, while the addresses per day metrics indicate that 47 projects are used by at least 100 addresses according to Dune on Optimism protocols metrics. Ideally, this removes all doubts about the activity and purpose of Optimism being fulfilled. Now, we\u2019re going to assume that most of the protocols have the same level of intentions to participate in the program; What would be a good criterion to measure a good voting power allocation method?     system:     total gas fees generated on Optimism during the proceeding Season      As discussed above, this measure alone cannot make a good fit from the subjectivity of benefiting the protocols that provide more benefits to Optimism: We should take into account that some even grant subsidies for use sponsored by the same governance (in the form of OP tokens) so add a weighting of other metrics like:  Active addresses per week TVL Volume Other metrics combined (same treatment as recent airdrop criteria).  For those projects that are encouraging activity with $op distribution, we will possibly find oversized data, the metrics regarding: Active addresses per week, TVL and volume, will not be taken according to current data; In these cases, each project must resolve the way in which they present this data. Pre-distribution metrics can be a parameter, but it will not be applicable to all (this is because many projects deployed with the grant and their distribution is not yet complete) along with their declaration of participation as delegates. These are just criteria ideas to consider. You could even think of a previous protocol classification:  DeFi Bridges Games Others  And from there, use one or a maximum of two objective metrics (gas and active addresses, for example, as applicable). The first classification would have to be approved and adjusted by governance, we would recommend doing it through a weighted vote (where each delegate expresses what % of allocation each category deserves, of the total proposed), and the rest according to the results of the metrics taken. The limits, participation requirement and code of conduct seem reasonable to be in line with the progress of governance, and not a big change from the current climate. One of the points that remain open is how to obtain a diverse participation of protocol representatives in Optimism before large lobbies repel other participation intentions, and at the same time, adjust to the processes that each protocol organization has to follow in order to be able to participate. exercise their work (what is the opportunity cost for a DAO to organize to elect a member dedicated to a possible delegation with potential concrete benefits) that doesn\u2019t discourage the desire to participate in this initiative. Small DAOs or reputable teams could quickly get up to speed but large protocols with governance such as Uniswap or Aave can lead to cumbersome processes. In addition, Optimism should be careful about endorsing representations to protocols that are not legitimate or agreed with the governance/DAO/community or whoever conforms to the protocol set, for example, let\u2019s imagine the following scenario: What happens if a founder decides to participate in the delegation on behalf of the protocol without explicit approval of the protocol (DAO/governance/community)? How can the Optimism collective deal with scenarios like this and distinguish legitimate entries? About an alternative proposal issued by @lavande Receiving the same voting power base for protocols is a better approach for the participation in a fairer way, but it is essential to evaluate how much the base would be equivalent to the multiplier. Resolving this, said proposal looks more solid and easier to reach a consensus regarding the use of metrics and objective and subjective classifications that will lengthen the discussion. For this reason, we consider it important to summarize the following advantages and disadvantages of this proposal: Advantages  On the original proposal: prioritize participation in probably more genuinely used protocols, indirectly representing Optimism users not yet involved in governance. On the alternative proposal: equal and fair treatment to begin with for all interested protocols.  Disadvantages  About the original proposal: too complex and it will take a long discussion without reaching a consensus of the majority (say >70%). About the alternative proposal: we do not like the proposed selection mode of 15 predefined and 8 additional by voting. We prefer to vote all 23 in a single round or faithfully follow the order of a table; since they result in better and simpler resolution paths (for example, discovering the protocols that are really interested from those that are not).  A final concern We cannot rule out that the sudden appearance of a new group of delegates may further discourage the work of independent or individual delegations, which at the end of the day, may reduce the diversity of participation in governance and, if unsuccessful, the delegations to protocols and have to be modified, reduced or eliminated, it\u2019s likely that some individual delegates have already left.

Since Uniswap\u2019s deployment on Optimism, we have been committed to ensuring the user experience is as accessible and seamless as possible.     millie:  there is no doubt that Uniswap offering the LM program on their interface, would have a much greater impact on participation.   Just to clarify, the Uniswap Foundation does not host any frontends or interfaces at this time, instead our goal is to empower teams already building on Uniswap, creating more opportunities in the same way that Optimism is doing so in this Protocol Delegate Proposal and with the grants awards before. We are definitely open to feedback on how we can improve generally. As a Day 1 ally of Optimism (a la unipigs), we are committed to helping increase usage of Uniswap on Optimism, but want to do so with both communities\u2019 best interests at the forefront. Whatever metrics the community chooses to prioritize projects, we will gladly support together with committed members of the Uniswap community.     jackanorak:  what sorts of measures can we use to identify the most representative, most beneficial, and most impactful voices among the protocols?   This being the most important question for this proposal, is equally just as important for us for much of what the Uniswap Foundation does for the growth of our own protocol. As an example, when the UF kicked off the OP Liquidity Mining campaign with the $OP that was rewarded to the protocol about 2 months ago, here, we had broken it into 3 phases which get progressively larger and were designed with input from the Uniswap community. In growing an aligned ecosystem for both the Uniswap and Optimism communities, we have been actively creating more opportunities to meaningfully contribute. As noted, the Uniswap Foundation Community Analytics Program ran an open bounty program for data analysts to analyze the first Phase of the LM program here. Looking at data from Phase 1, the LM program used only a small percentage (6.25%) of our $OP allocation in only 3 pools, brought over 200 new LPs with over $30M of TVL throughout the campaign, and maintained LP stickiness, even increasing TVL and transaction volume for 2 of the pools (credit to @springzhang). With the community\u2019s help, we will post a retro on Phase 1 soon, integrate community feedback for tweaks to Phase 2, and launch that sometime in December to onboard even more users to Optimism!     lavande:  We\u2019ll continue experimenting with ways to empower all types of delegates. We welcome discussion or ideas around future programs that could increase participation, balance representation, and/or get more folks involved.   This proposal is really exciting for us because Uniswap has not had the capability to participate in cross-protocol governance until now. With the UF, a core mission of ours is to be an advocate for the Uniswap community, including our governance representation on chains that Uniswap is deployed on. If we are included in the Protocol Delegation Program, our tentative plan is to propose the $OP be delegated to a multisig of 5, four being Uniswap community delegates and one representative from the UF. Our intention is to source nominations for the OP-UNI multisig from community members who are currently building on or are actively participating in Optimism ecosystem development. While the final details will not be confirmed until we receive more clarity on the Protocol Delegation Program, we are thrilled by the opportunity to be long term stakeholders in Optimism governance with help of other committed Uniswap community builders!

Another issue I have is that the protocols selected to carry out the OP distribution on behalf of UniswapFDN, are leveraging semi-custodial at worst and more centralized at best, solutions for the OP distribution. Liquidity managers are not high trust among LPs in DeFi and rightfully so, since they come with added smart contract risks.

There\u2019s also a variation of that contract built by @david with a small modification to allow for more passive LPing using the UniV3staker. Uniswap is obviously one of the most important protocols in crypto and so I hold anyone repping that name to a high standard.
