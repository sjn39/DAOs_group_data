                    "content": "Currently Maker governance is considering changing the USDC-A parameters. Currently recently changed USDC-A parameters: Collateralization Ratio: 103 (lowered just a day ago from 110) soon to 101 Debt Ceiling: 200M (raised from 100M just a day ago from 100M) Risk Premium: 2% The goal of this signal request is to modify how Maker is extending Debt Ceilings against Liquidation Ratios on not just USDC but all of the stablecoins.  I use USDC here just to give a flavor of what this proposal is suggesting. Goals   LR/DC consistency across all the stablecoins To provide for some control over the amount of stablecoins the system holds against the DAI minted indirectly controlling the PEG value via liquidity available in the total facilities.  Proposed is the idea for stablecoins to create multiple vaults with alogrithmic LR/DC consruction based on a singular BASE_LR_STABLECOIN value - which in the example below i set to 101 Example: BASE_LR_STABLECOIN=101 USDC_TOTAL_DC=700M DAI Construct the following USDC vaults. USDC-A1 with LR of BASE_LR_STABLECOIN=101 and DC of 100M USDC-A2 with LR of 2 x BASE_LR_STABLECOIN=102 and DC of 200M USDC-A3 with LR of 3 x BASE_LR_STABLECOIN=103 and DC of 400M Initial suggestion is to keep the SF the same on these vaults. The point here is that if the PEG is < 1.01 then all of these vaults can be used with varying amounts of leverage and differing amounts of DC.  My primary concern here was lumping all of our stablecoin borrowing into the same LR and hence the same backing collateral amount to DAI printed.   In the above model the average USDC deposit for 1DAI minted grows as the vaults are filled and the amount of leverage that can be applied diminishes. (see point below) One primary point.  If the DAI-USDC price is > 1.03 all vaults have infinite leverage only controlled by the DC level available.   This is the prime reason to have multiple vaults with different LR and DCs, and to have an exponentially (factors of 2) increase in the DC size of the vault to apply against the LR.  For each pricing tier breached another facility with effectively infinite leverage comes into play with DC to beat the PEG back down to the target.  These all are always in play at all times but it is my expectation these will fill sequentially due to ability to apply higher leverage with lower LRs. Realize while I picked a number of vaults and some basic parameters (the BASE_LR, and the 2x DC multiplier and 3 vs. 4 vaults) these are up for further discussion and refinement if the proposal passes with yes otherwise we leave this as a no. Should Maker use the above proposal as a multiple vault model to address the DAI liquidity in stablecoin facilities available to control the amount of stablecoins relative to DAI minted and hence PEG price with various levels of liquidity.     No - The approaches being taken now are good enough. Yes - We need something like the above (for at least USDC and perhaps all Stablecoins) and should would up a formal proposal.

I\u2019m wondering, do we get a proportional amount of benefit from putting in this additional work. Or is one parameter sufficient as a stop-gap.   I am a big fan of KISS which is why I think we just apply the same model to all stablecoins to achieve an effective lower bound BASE_LR_STABLECOIN PEG target.   The formula for LR/DC is up for grabs.   I\u2019d like it to be a singular formula where we just have for each set of vaults a DC_TOTAL and leave the SFs on all of these collateraltype subvaults be the same. The only thing I am proposing here is a kind of tiered LR/CR level of DC application of liquidity to PEG management.  The other goal is to ease governance management of ALL stablecoins and add a level of consistency between all of them if we are going to go to low LRs across the board.   The problem using a single vault with LR/DC is that once the DC is hit - that vault is done providing liquidity.  I want another vault to come on line (or be there) that provides the next tier of liquidity automatically. Our problem here is that BASE_LR_STABLECOIN that is used to determine the tiers of LRs should not be raised but only lowered.   The total DC\u2019s managed by a single collateral type cap as we do now. Right now we can parse these out piecemeal and poll/approve each and every one like we have.   I am for taking a different approach on the stablecoins as a group since they for the most part will be used for PEG management. ",

If the first vault does fill up, it means there\u2019s a higher amount of demand for DAI, they\u2019ll be okay paying a higher SF. Also we don\u2019t want these waterfall vaults to fill up too fast. Also, since they\u2019re used for demand spikes, users will probably use them for a shorter term. ",

We should want them to be able to use the USDC collateral to help pull down the peg with leverage BUT also as there is more risk (because of the 1.01 LR) the Maker system is taking more risk. If MKR is taking more risk, then the risk premium should be elevated to offset that. At 50% per annum, no market maker is going to keep his / her position outstanding very long. ",

You\u2019re basically guaranteeing that the vault gets abandoned. They end up dropping under 100% collateralization after a week. Then you start printing unbacked DAI into the surplus.
