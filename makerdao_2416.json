I wouldn\u2019t be too sure of that, there\u2019s definitely a group of people, some very outspoken ETH bulls on twitter, that do not like anything aside from ETH as collateral because any other collateral type has some form of centralisation, additional risk. This certainly goes for tokenized assets. I don\u2019t know how large that group is in terms of MKR holdings but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. ",

To be honest I think that the answer is pretty mundane, which is that the initial list was a holdover from an earlier time, before WBTC had been developed has far as it has. Moving forward, we should be starting regular governance cycles in Q1 2020 (assuming migration goes well). At this point I suspect we will setup a ongoing/rolling poll that allows re-prioritisation of new and old assets. I imagine WBTC will be one of the assets in that ongoing poll. Whether it gets prioritised though is another matter. ",
