Moreover, there are too many new platforms springing up with too many incentives such as BSC, Fantom, Matic, Heco\u2026 This leads to a large number of investors switching to holding tokens with high incentives and low costs.  ERC will only be for real whales.  This can be seen as a clear class division.  And that\u2019s not good for the community project at all.   ",
