Also/relatedly, MakerDAO is associated with thousands of Vaults with USDC that have been used as collateral for issuance of millions or billions of DAI.  Circle could add the addresses of all Maker Vaults containing DAI and the PSM to it\u2019s blacklist. Because any transactions [edit: involving USDC], including PSM and liquidation transactions require interacting with the USDC Smart Contract, and because that smart contract would no longer accept such interactions, those vaults would no longer be liquidatable, and there would no longer be a reliable exit point from DAI to USDC (and implicitly, to fiat). So while DAI transactions could continue, the DAI itself would no longer be collateralized the same way. Also, any liquidity pools that held both DAI and USDC would potentially stop functioning, and DAI in those pools could be directly frozen. ",

MakerDao is operating under the assumption that they are allowed to operate, the us government could make ridiculous demands to keep Dai under control. I honestly think that the current trajectory of makerdao is not possible to execute. Why would the us government accept that there is a stablecoin pegged to the dollar that they cant freeze.They can freeze the collateral and I dont see a reason why they wont if they decide that Dai is being used by russia/north korea for anything. Stablecoin backing should be something managable like 5-10%  from different stablecoins. I understand there are many people on the payroll on maker. They want to legitimize Dai to keep the money flowing. But this will only work if Dai becomes freezable, censorable, permissioned. And at this point there is really no need for Dai anymore. ",

Fair enough, most of the community agrees with this point. The reality is that the shift to being mostly USDC collateralized has happened fast and driven by the market and not by CU\u2019s actions, not many in MKR want DAI to become a wUSDC. There are limited options that a USD PSM can pair with but it is possible to diversify if the incentives are right (e.g. lower fees in other PSM vaults vs USDC) or by using alternative options like Synthetix.

The problem we address is somewhat broader than USDC, it is being able to offer a fully decentralized currency pegged to the Dollar. A space that at the moment is only occupied by Liquity, which may also be the solution. In the end, how it has emerged that one of the needs that this space has is a stable currency that is at the highest level of decentralization and that happens by using ETH as collateral. There is no other possibility. That space was occupied by MakerDAO in its first implementation and they had some serious limitations of growth as we know. Multicollateralized DAI has been a great way to grow, but the need for a fully stable currency that is extremely uncensorable has not gone away.

Only that the token you get has additional regulatory risk compared to the others that you can borrow against and are truly decentralized (LUSD, RAI, sUSD just three of the top of my head. Soon AAVES stable aswell.   Really insightful post. I would argue that LUSD, RAI have their own risks as well starting with the PEG which ultimately creates volatility between the amount borrowed and amount to be repaid. There is a stablecoin spectrum (USDT/USDC to RAI/sUSD) and I think DAI aims to be somewhere in the middle. As a community though we should decide where we want to be. Based on real-time collateral backing metrics, DAI is fast approaching USDC/USDT status. Even though the market has shifted towards safety, MKR governance actions have also pushed DAI towards the censorable part of the balance (MKR sets debt limit on the different products: PSM, RWA, vaults,etc). Those are the things we can control to shift the balance back to decentralization, if thats what we want. Most MIPs I see focus on RWA, Bond strategies and few aim towards peg range  or crypto vault incentives, so I am thinking the community is also responsible for this shift. What is the right balance between competing priorities: PEG maintenance and decentralization? You will notice that the community is divided between what DAI\u2019s allowable PEG range should be for optimal use which drives DAI collateral. ",

You could back DAI with FRAX, but since it has backing by USDC via Curve, which circle would need to be blacklisted\u2026 I somehow feel you could get another UST situation. ",

I think it couldnt hurt to replace 2% of the USDC position with ethereum backed stablecoins. Another 5% with Eth. And remove the ability of the PSM to mint Dai. Or make it prohibitively expensive. If makers Eth position would be underwater Dai price might dip under 1 Dollar and a bankrun would start and the PSM would start reinstating the peg and burn a lot of Dai. Also maker could use the Eth to stake, rEth comes to mind. ",
