We\u2019re with the team of Curve Finance that\u2019s going to explain how the project works and how it relates to Maker, and the CRV token as collateral, its impact and whatnot. Ideally we\u2019ll have a relaxed conversation, so if you have any questions you don\u2019t need to wait until the end: we can interrupt and make sure that everything\u2019s understood. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   CRV  [CRV] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application  Michael Egorov, Angel and Julien Bouteloup Presentation 00:58 Curve01920\u00d71080 89.9 KB Michael Egorov: \u201cWe have multiple pools with multiple coins. Let me explain about pool liquidity provider tokens and then about the Curve DAO token (CRV)\u201d Curve11920\u00d71080 103 KB Michael Egorov: \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Curve token, CRV. CRV is a governance token that allows to participate in the DAO\u201d 1920\u00d71080 91 KB Michael Egorov: \u201c[When you deposit either stablecoin or one of the BTC wraps and then you have a representation of that pool] you can redeem it into any of the three\u201d Discussion  16:10 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: When you redeem, are the defaults that you get based on how much you put or on the state of the pool at that given moment? 17:49 - Andrew Burban: Will you be able to use the pools as collateral for vaults? 18:27 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Right now the proposed token is the CRV token, but I guess the pools could be proposed as well 19:20 - Akash: Regarding the distribution of CRV \u2014 it seems to be a pretty large amount. From a token mechanics perspective\u2026 20:22 - Akash: Does the CRV token eventually earn some of the fees? 23:03 - Akash: What\u2019s the most liquid place in terms of a pool for the actual CRV token? Are there incentives to provide liquidity for that pool? 26:54 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Would having leverage on either CRV or one the liquidity pools help you with whatever you\u2019re building towards the future\u2026? 29:14 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I want to show you something. Not long ago we released a Collateral Framework 31:58 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: What are you working on right now? What are your next steps? 34:35 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: How is swapping BTC for ETH going to work if it\u2019s not in the same pool? Is it similar to Uni? 36:13 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Going back to the pool, how are the pools kept in a balance? Or is there no balance? Do you rebalance the pool or is it more like you just let people deposit and\u2026? 38:11 - Akash: What\u2019s the best way to figure out the price impact? 39:35 - Akash: What kind of data analytics platform would you recomend in terms of getting things like 24-hour volume\u2026? 44:54 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: We had the guys from EURStasis presenting their currency not long ago\u2026 46:17 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: How many euros are out there? 01:02:26 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Let\u2019s say one of the liquidity pools is accepted as collateral. Why would I use this token instead of using ETH?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 01:06:41  Thank you very much. We\u2019ll keep in touch.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.
