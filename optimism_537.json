However, Optimism lags behind Arbitrum and Polygon in terms of TVL and volume on various Layer 2 networks. This deficiency of liquidity and volume can be a significant deterrent for projects considering launching on Optimism, as these factors hold much sway in their decision-making. Enter Quadrat, a protocol that specializes in generating liquidity for tokens in a cost-effective manner. With the concentrated liquidity feature of Uniswap v3, Quadrat can create deep liquidity for traders with less capital, making it an excellent option for projects with limited resources. Thanks to Quadrat Protocol, liquidity is no longer a barrier for projects considering launching on Optimism. More project launches on Optimism will lead to an increase in trading activity, resulting in an upswing in volume on Uniswap and OP. This will promote the growth of Optimism and solidify its position as a leading L2 network.  In summary, Quadrat Protocol offers a permissionless and non-custodial liquidity management service that can help projects overcome the liquidity barrier and increase trading activity, leading to enhanced volume and acceleration of Optimism\u2019s growth.   image1920\u00d71073 133 KB  How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Liquidity mining rewards can be an effective way to attract liquidity and increase trading volume and APY for liquidity providers. Our proposal is to create a farming campaign with Quadrat Strategies, an active liquidity management protocol, for the most important liquidity pairs and tokens, offering a competitive APY for liquidity providers. These strategies will include a range of price options, providing liquidity providers with different choices based on their risk tolerance. We suggest distributing OP grant tokens among the major token pairs and launching a contest for new tokens on OP to secure a portion of liquidity for their liquidity farming pools. 0xPlasma Governance can organize this contest on behalf of OP governance and the grant program. Quadrat can also provide infrastructure for any token project on Optimism to launch their liquidity farming campaign on Uniswap v3. We believe that the right combination of OP rewards and liquidity concentration can bring the best possible APY for liquidity providers and attract substantial liquidity from the mainnet. Additionally, we would like to highlight that the Quadrat Farming Booster model rewards users with pool LPs token (token+OP), which can increase the final APY of liquidity farming by 2x.  The Quadrat Farming Booster is a powerful product for any token project seeking to bootstrap its liquidity and increase APY for token holders. It provides a model of liquidity lockup with various reward-boosting tiers.   image1560\u00d71646 366 KB  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: Here are our main theses:   When liquidity providers actively engage with Quadrat to provide liquidity on Uniswap v3 pools, they can efficiently maximize their returns and ensure trading on the OP is optimal.   Quadrat Liquidity Booster offers users the opportunity to earn rewards through liquidity farming on Uniswap v3, incentivizing them to provide and lock more liquidity on Optimism, resulting in a well-distributed and ample liquidity pool to support diverse trading activities.   The virtuous cycle created by the combination of active liquidity management and liquidity farming draws in more liquidity providers, leading to a more robust and efficient trading environment on Optimism.   As Uniswap v3 and Quadrat continue to expand their reach and attract more liquidity providers, trading activity on the platform is likely to increase, which may drive broader adoption of the Optimism layer 2 solution.   Ultimately, the fusion of active liquidity management through Quadrat and liquidity farming on Uniswap v3 has the potential to be a significant catalyst for growth in the Optimism ecosystem, enabling DeFi to be more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for users worldwide.   When Quadrat and Farming tools are made available for any protocol and token on Optimism, they hold the potential to attract a large influx of liquidity and trading activities to the platform. The greater the adoption of these tools, the more liquidity and trading volume can be expected to flow into Optimism.   Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 360,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount? : N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives?: We are still in the process of bridging our governance $PPAY token from the mainnet to Optimism. When we do launch the token, we will initiate liquidity mining rewards to support liquidity and grow the OP ecosystem. How will the OP tokens be distributed?: Our team has devised distribution guidelines for our pools liquidity farming campaign, which we would like to share. Firstly, we have decided to allocate 70% of OP tokens for a 12 OP/blue-chip pool campaign, with a liquidity lockup period of 3 months. These pools will serve as the mainstay of the liquidity farming campaign. Secondly, we have dedicated 30% of OP tokens for a liquidity contest open to other protocols on OP. The campaign will run for 3-6 months and feature a liquidity lockup period. New OP protocols and tokens may apply for the contest, and the winners will receive an additional liquidity incentive for their pools on Uniswap v3. The 0xPlasma Governance will select the winners through Snapshot voting on the candidates on behalf of OP Governance. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? We propose a shorter timeline campaign to attract liquidity faster and lock it within Uniswap v3 pools for a long time after the farming campaign is finished. For example 3 months for major pools and 6 months for token pools with min 3, 6, and 12 months of liquidity lockup tiers. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone-based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: We have constructed our forecast and assumptions model based on the current Uniswap v3 liquidity / APY and the requested tokens from the grant program (360,000 OP). The current Uniswap v3 TVL/APY on OP for blue-chip tokens looks promising. The average pool APY for blue-chip tokens such as ETH, USDC, wBTC with a narrow range (+/-10% price) is 233%, and for a wide range (+/-50% price), it is 43%. However, most of the OP pools with the same blue-chip tokens exhibit no TVL or Volume. To remedy this, we propose to allocate 260,000 OP (70% of the total OP grant) to new pools of token/OP with a fee tier of 0.05% to attract liquidity to these pools and increase arbitrage volume for all OP pools. Our target median of Pool APY for Strategies with narrow ranges is 300%, comprising 150% basic and 150% of APY from the OP token rewards. Based on our high-level estimation, we expect an additional $6M TVL (minimum) / $12M TVL (maximum) and $116M of weekly volume. For the remaining 30% of the grant, we propose distributing it between 5-10 pools of tokens, selected by 0xPlasma Governance based on the quality of projects and their community activities. The OP tokens will be distributed linearly for 3 and 6 months, depending on the pool and farming campaign. Detailed analytics for the pools and assumptions for the upcoming liquidity farming campaign can be found in our public Google Sheets: Quadrat OP Farming Campaign Forecast - Google Sheets  image2754\u00d7744 349 KB  Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? : Liquidity farming is a great way to start bootstrapping liquidity, trading volume, and increasing APY on Optimism. Once we see liquidity migration and highly competitive and stable APY for liquidity providers, they will be less likely to leave the pools after the campaign is completed. Furthermore, it is crucial to showcase the Quadrat liquidity boost use case to protocols and tokens on Optimism. It will have a more significant and long-term impact on the OP ecosystem\u2019s development than even a liquidity mining campaign itself. Any project will be able to establish its liquidity farming campaign to attract liquidity and improve distribution for traders on Uniswap v3.
