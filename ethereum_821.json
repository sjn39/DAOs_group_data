This sounds to my ears remarkably like something a government official would not only say, but attend. Decentralized networks admit inclusion of anyone who runs a node. All of us should reflect that profoundly important idea in how we communicate and act. \u201cPlanned Berlin Councils\u201d sound non-inclusive. If I were planning the \u201cPlanned Berlin Council\u201d it would be in a park, a soccer stadium, or a field and it would allow an unlimited number of people to attend. As I say, I want to be as polite as I can be, but given the recent article about the \u201cSecret Meeting\u201d at EdCon, I think that if we\u2019re in a new world order, we should start thinking (and importantly speaking) in a new world way. I will recede, now, back into quietude. ",

We have been calling our gatherings \u201cCouncils\u201d, and we have had one in Paris and are planning on in Berlin. The EIP0 Summit was not a Council, rather a more general gathering of those in the community interested in governance. All are welcome to come to Berlin, but those helping with planning the next Council still need to finalize on the details and be more specific before people starting arriving, looking for a Schelling point  If anyone here wants to help organize, ping me and we\u2019ll see how you can help out. We have no officers or leaders yet and are functioning more as a collective with only a proposed process. There is no cabal with secret handshakes. One of the proposed core principles of the Magicians is openness, and we\u2019re taking that seriously. ",
