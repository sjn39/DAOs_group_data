I want to offer my guide here for these interested, and ideally turn this into a single thread where others can post their guide. I will work to add each newly published guide to this first post to prevent lots of scrolling through the thread.  Kyle\u2019s Voter\u2019s Guide Annika\u2019s Voter\u2019s Guide Lindsey\u2019s Voter\u2019s Guide Nate\u2019s Voters Guide  Happy voting and thanks again to the workstreams for the immense work this season (yet again!).
