Celsius has stopped withdrawals. Do we have to suffer repercussions or does something have to be done with Celsius deals etc.? Or are they just \u201cordinary\u201d vault users where Liq 2.0 just comes into play. Can the CUs who are in contact with Celsius and Nexo or worked with them please comment on this? Nexo seems to take over assets otc from Celsius, Celsius will probably be liquidated. These are cruel times, I hope the protocol comes out of the whole thing stronger, whatever else may come, this situation will probably throw out more market participants. ",

We reached out to them earlier today and we were told they are monitoring the situation. Worse case if the 280m WBTC-A gets liquidated, the Maker liquidation system would start liquidating their vault in 40m DAI tranches every 30min (really depends on price trajectory), until the point where their collateralization improves - which might be all the way down to 280m liquidated. The outcome really depends on price trajectory and their ability to top-up collateral or repay in time. Note also that when you liquidate 40m on total debt of 280m you increase CR from 145% to about 150% if prices stay flat from last OSM update (assuming there\u2019s also not a lot of slippage coming from keepers).
