As an institutional structured credit investment fund within one of crypto\u2019s most prominent asset management firms, we are committed to improving Real World Asset (RWA) DeFi and proving the merits of blockchain to the world. Furthermore, we are uniquely situated to partner with Maker as an \u201carranger\u201d given our structural alignment with the protocol (BlockTower is a large MKR holder and active Maker governance member) and on each deal we facilitate (BlockTower stakes significant first-loss, junior capital on every deal). We believe there is room for many well capitalized entities with significant alignment of interest with Maker (which we effectuate through BlockTower\u2019s junior capital, token ownership, and governance involvement) to become more active and generate value for the Maker community. We believe Maker\u2019s long term interests are best served through a diversified set of high-quality arrangers, credit exposures, and other partners - we look forward to helping Maker raise the bar. You can read more about BlockTower Credit and our firm in our previous Maker forum introductory post.  BlockTower Credit (Asset Manager) [1, 4, 30]  BlockTower Credit (\u201cBT\u201d) is an institutional investment fund, applying the skills of professional underwriting, structuring and investing at the intersection of real-world credit (a massive but anachronistic traditional industry) and crypto. BlockTower Credit is the credit franchise of BlockTower Capital, an SEC-registered digital asset and blockchain investment firm founded in 2017 by Ari Paul (CIO) and Matthew Goetz (CEO). The firm manages well over half a billion dollars and draws on decades of combined experience across professional investing and trading, early-stage venture capital, and credit. A more detailed firm overview can be found here. BlockTower Credit manages a traditional asset-backed private credit strategy that primarily finances fintech and non-bank originators via senior secured debt facilities. The assets in our core credit portfolio are securitized through DeFi, proving DeFi\u2019s potential to transform the traditional credit markets and bridging real-world assets into the digital realm. We as a team, and BlockTower as a firm, are committed to ushering in this future and working with long-term partners to make it the world-changing reality it promises to be. This includes partners like Centrifuge, a protocol BlockTower has invested in, and the Maker community where we are long-time believers, large MKR token holders, and active governance participants (particularly where our expertise can be additive and useful to the community and its goals). Drawing on our significant experience investing across the public and private structured credit and whole loan markets, as well as our operational experience running early-stage fintech lenders, we have a competitive advantage in sourcing, underwriting, and investing in real-world credit assets. Cheap bank and insurance capital is generally unavailable in this market segment, leading to attractive risk-adjusted yields for professionals who can execute on these types of opportunities. The underlying credit assets are also generally shorter duration in nature (<2-3 years), an ideal investment profile for Maker\u2019s current stage of safe and scalable deployment into RWA. BlockTower Credit is led by seasoned credit investment professionals with experience running trading desks and credit strategies at leading institutions like Citigroup, Hildene Capital Management, Goldman Sachs, Capchase, and Axonic. BlockTower, the firm, also brings the support of ~30 professionals across investment, risk management, operations, legal and compliance, data science, and software development functions (and we\u2019re hiring - reach out if you\u2019re interested)! Biographies of BlockTower Credit\u2019s principals: Ari Paul, Principal, Chief Investment Officer Ari Paul co-founded BlockTower Capital in 2017 and began his career in the financial services industry in 2006.

Jack earned a B.A. in philosophy and history (magna cum laude) from Colgate University.  Investment Process [33]  BlockTower\u2019s approach to structured credit investing is honed through our collective experience investing, and managing investment teams, in private and public securitized credit opportunities at the highest professional levels. Our end-to-end process is focused on responsible investing and risk mitigation at every step, resulting in a rigorous and systematic investment approach that can be broken into four key components on a deal-by-deal basis: Sector Analysis to identify attractive investment opportunities, including broad analysis of the expected performance, liquidity, and correlation of the assets and originators to macroeconomic factors, including interest rates, unemployment, sector specific trends, and other economic indicators. Sourcing & Origination to generate a robust top-of-funnel deal flow through our ecosystem of partnerships and unique position as leading a digital asset investment firm partnering with tech-enabled originators. These partnerships are augmented by BlockTower\u2019s broad relationships across both traditional and digital finance, community activity, media presence, and systematic outbound strategy, targeting originators generating assets with attractive risk and reward characteristics. Underwriting & Due Diligence to accurately project loan unit economics, expected performance, recovery value of the underlying secured asset (if applicable), financial position and viability of the originator itself, and other factors to analyze various stressed scenarios and price risk. This includes meetings with management, engaging third party experts for valuation and compliance reviews, background checks, which ultimately result in the negotiation and execution of a term sheet. Structuring, Executing & Monitoring to create appropriate legal documentation, perfect security of our collateral interest, institute meaningful financial and eligibility covenants, establish exclusivity terms, and identify backup servicing solutions and other service providers to manage distressed situations and maximize recovery. Once a transaction is consummated, covenant testing and collateral performance is monitored on an ongoing basis, with proactive management to arrest funding at the earliest stages of distress. Each deal will be surfaced to BlockTower\u2019s investment committee, which considers input from BlockTower\u2019s internal and external legal, compliance, operations, and finance divisions to provide a final go or no-go investment decision. BlockTower\u2019s credit portfolio will be constructed with an eye towards limiting exposure and concentration in any specific originator or underlying asset, maximizing diversification and lowering the volatility of returns to the extent possible. New investments will not be made in a vacuum, but instead with consideration to the impact on the holistic construction of the portfolio. Additionally, new investments are generally evaluated against other sectors and historical valuation and performance benchmarks.  Transaction Legal Structure [10, 11, 17, 18, 29, 35]  Transactions will follow known legal structures that the Maker community has already deployed or audited. Centrifuge, our partner, has already laid the legal groundwork necessary to conduct on-chain securitization (see Centrifuge update with LTS CU, Indenture Trustee post, and progress update on legal structures for Centrifuge RWA vaults for examples). Furthermore, we will be adding assurances and including the best practices set forth by Huntingdon Valley Bank (click here for HVBank\u2019s MIP 6 proposal). We have and will continue to engage counsel and Maker Core Units to ensure that proper legal structures are in place to align incentives, protect interests, and ensure regulatory compliance. At a high-level, the legal structure for transactions will involve:  SPV - a bankruptcy-remote entity that debt assets will be purchased into. SPVs enable owners, debt holders or interested parties of the entity to be unaffected by the parent entity\u2019s financial, operational and/or legal health. Trustee - a regulated financial institution, like WSFS Bank, where the SPV enters into an Indenture. The Trustee will administer the SPV and act on the behalf of DROP/TIN token holders, including Maker and BlockTower. Furthermore, the Trustee will either engage with or play the role of a \u201cVerification Agent\u201d to ensure assets submitted into the SPV comply with pre-defined parameters agreed upon by the Maker community through a vote. The Trustee should be regulated, well capitalized, and carry insurance. Paying Agent - a regulated broker-dealer who can securely exchange Dai for USD and vice-versa based on pre-agreed upon terms on behalf of the Trustee  For illustrative purposes, we\u2019ve created a high-level transaction flow overview below:  1600\u00d7358 85 KB   Transaction Financial Structure [6, 7, 14, 31]  We believe our proposed terms, inclusive of our junior equity commitments to protect Maker\u2019s principal and align our interests, are very differentiated from prior proposals. With this in mind, BlockTower has solicited feedback from the community, delegates, and MKR holders to arrive at the following arranger proposal. Underlying Asset: BlockTower will arrange a diversified portfolio of DROP tokens, representing super-senior tranches of BlockTower\u2019s core investments in senior-secured, asset-backed facilities to fintech or other non-bank lenders. These assets will be delivered to Maker in tokenized form via the currently operational and tested MIP21/22 protocols. The revolving facilities will be between 18-36 months in duration, with the underlying assets generally 1 month to 3 years in duration. Maker RWF has been provided our current deal pipeline for review (subject to NDA); these assets generally include invoice financing, trade finance, or other short term receivables (like those discussed here). For certain assets, BlockTower may directly purchase loans via forward flow agreements that we believe lead to more sustainable, better risk-adjusted returns. Overall, we believe these assets fit the right duration profile and, given BlockTower\u2019s active management of the portfolio and the diversified nature of the underlying collateral, provide significant structural enhancements to Maker\u2019s super-senior risk position. Principal Amount: We are looking for an initial commitment of $150MM DAI. We believe this commitment, if agreed upon by the Maker community, reflects our position as long-term partners to the Maker ecosystem. Over time, we are prepared and hopeful to scale this alongside Maker\u2019s continued growth, provided there is continued interest from the Maker community and BlockTower Credit continues to deliver superb performance. In addition, we have already been asked by others if we have the capacity and desire to arrange portfolios of particular credits on behalf of Maker (e.g., direct clean money vision, short term treasuries, etc). We have significant investment experience across a wide range of credit assets and strategies, and we are open to direction from Maker to spin up separate pools going forward. Interest Rate / Stability Fee: BlockTower Credit is proposing a 4% fixed stability fee. Eligibility Criteria for Maker: Eligible DROP tokens for Maker financing will be required to fit a defined box (which we will codify through both off-chain legal documentation and on-chain via Centrifuge). BlockTower will enter into this, and all agreements with Maker, representing that the information provided by our borrowers has been verified to the best of our ability. In addition, we expect these terms to be further refined through Maker RWF CU\u2019s, and the community\u2019s, review of the contained materials.  Investment Process and Due Diligence:  Contingent on BlockTower investment committee approval of investment, as well as successful internal and external due diligence, in accordance with our process documented in the \u201cInvestment Process\u201d section of this MIP  Minimum Junior Capital Threshold:  30% junior, subordinated BlockTower capital in every investment (effectuated through minimum TIN ratio of 30% on Centrifuge). This means that, for every dollar of exposure, BlockTower commits to absorbing the first 30c of loss on the underlying asset exposure  Isolation of Assets:  Subject to the Centrifuge Indenture Trust structure, the underlying assets will be purchased into a bankruptcy remote SPV, isolating the assets from originator and other possible intercreditors  Maximum Duration:  36 month revolving facility commitment, with self-liquidation through the amortization of the underlying short-duration credit assets  Payment of Maker Fees:  BlockTower Credit commits to paying fees, within reason, associated with the transaction on behalf of Maker  Active Management:  BlockTower commits to active management of the underlying assets and holistic portfolio, including ongoing transaction monitoring and reporting to the Maker community (subject to compliance with NDA and MNPI regulation)  Risks & Mitigants [12, 13, 16, 32, 34]  To reiterate from our introductory post, we believe the strongest mitigant of all is a structural alignment of interest through at-risk, first-loss capital that serves as credit enhancement to Maker\u2019s senior position. This structure, as enforced automatically and directly on-chain through Tinlake, means that BlockTower will bear any losses until such a point when defaults breach both BlockTower\u2019s capital and, if applicable, the originator\u2019s equity position. This idea is akin to risk retention in traditional securitization markets, where an arranger\u2019s capital is placed in a first-loss position to incentivize the arranger (BlockTower) to generate strong performing credits. This enhances Maker RWA scalability and security by leaving day-to-day risk management decisions to BlockTower, while Maker\u2019s rights to the cash flows (and underlying assets) are encoded and enforceable by the DROP subscription agreement and smart contracts. Practically, this means that BlockTower would operate akin to a \u201cPortfolio Manager\u201d vs. \u201cOriginator\u201d of loans for Maker. This is ideal because unlike originators, who generate the bulk of their economics outside of the SPV that Maker has recourse to (i.e., origination fees, servicing fees, broker fees, etc), BlockTower\u2019s economics are driven by the performance of assets in the SPV. This means that, unlike an originator, we have every incentive to wind down poorly performing facilities early (whereas an originator has an incentive to continue selling assets into the SPV without consistent, enforceable monitoring by the lending party). Even more importantly, BlockTower is not a \u201ctransactional broker.\u201d On every asset that Maker finances, BlockTower will have significant skin in the game by providing subordinated, junior capital that provides credit enhancement to Maker\u2019s senior position. We do not make money by selling loans, without any residual exposure, into Maker\u2019s treasury. We make money the old-fashioned way: by picking great assets, structuring responsible deals, and taking the vast majority of the risk ourselves. We don\u2019t succeed unless Maker is also succeeding. Additional risk factors and BlockTower\u2019s approach to mitigating them as follows:     Concern Description Blocktower Approach     Perfection of Collateral Ensuring that assets in the SPV are unencumbered and DROP/TIN token holders can enforce their legal claim on those assets BT will file UCC-1/3 (or relevant filing) per the BT <> Originator loan agreement, with DROP/TIN subscription docs clearly effectuating claim on the underlying assets and cashflows   Servicing Assets Ensuring that cash makes it from end borrower <> SPV (USD to USD) and SPV <> Maker (USD to DAI) We will employ the approach proposed by Centrifuge and RWAC/HVB; likely using Genesis (and/or others) as the transfer agent for DAI <> fiat <> DAI   Protecting Maker\u2019s Interests as a Tokenholder Making sure that an arm\u2019s length party will ensure Maker\u2019s interests (as DROP note holder) are protected Indenture Trust (WSFS Bank in existing deals) as a trustee operating for the benefit of DROP/TIN holders. We will also follow prior Maker best practices with an independent verification agent to ensure Maker finances only eligible DROP assets   Transparency (Oracle) Consistent monitoring of asset performance; necessary to ensure that facilities are performing as expected given limited pricing transparency in secondary debt markets We will monitor asset performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. We\u2019ve made significant investments to build technology around this process [example asset report available upon request]   Principal Preservation/Asset Liquidation If performance suffers, there needs to be a reliable liquidation mechanism to protect Maker\u2019s DROP position As the junior position on every deal we bring to MKR, our economic decisions are driven by asset performance and ultimate recovery. BT will monitor collateral performance daily and will trigger an event of default, acceleration, and/or liquidation if performance suffers.   Technical Integration Some integrations (i.e. RWA D3M) will take significantly longer than anyone expects. This involves both technical integrations w/ Transfer or Exchange agents (i.e. Genesis), platforms like Centrifuge, or directly with a RWA arranger Beyond using Centrifuge\u2019s existing rails, BlockTower has significant institutional knowledge within DeFi and substantial technical resources at its disposal. We consider the latter resources for the MKR technical community, should they want it    Based on prior RWA discourse, we believe these risks are the most relevant for the Maker community. In the interest of decluttering the post, BlockTower Credit has compiled an exhaustive list of risk disclaimers beyond this. Please reach out directly if you\u2019re interested in receiving it.  Partners [36]  A few key partners are necessary to properly execute the transactions we envision. We have already engaged several key players, many of whom have extensive experience working with the Maker ecosystem, namely:  Centrifuge provides a scalable and secure technology platform to properly securitize assets on-chain. Centrifuge Tinlake has already brought over $25M in assets to Maker through existing RWA vaults. In addition to leveraging Centrifuge\u2019s deep technical expertise, we will also be extending much of the legal framework that the team has built around DROP and TIN tokens. Additional details, including structural and technical considerations associated with Centrifuge\u2019s platform, can be found on our prior introductory Maker forum post (found here). WSFS Bank is our preferred partner in establishing the trust structure and providing the necessary banking services. WSFS has been referenced in previous MIPs as a key partner in TradFi that has experience working on behalf of Maker. Furthermore, through prior discussions with WSFS, we are confident that we may leverage existing structures and processes from previous Maker transactions for future deals. A broker / dealer, otherwise known as a paying agent, is necessary to convert between Dai used primarily within Maker\u2019s ecosystem and Centrifuge Tinlake and fiat USD used primarily in real-world asset financing. Such a paying agent will likely be a regulated, reliable, and scalable partner like Genesis. A third-party verification agent may be required to enforce pre-agreed upon parameters with the Maker community in the trust structure. These pre-agreed upon parameters may include investment terms, payment schedules, etc. If such an external agent is required, we will work with both the Maker community and WSFS to identify ideal candidates to play this role. Legal counsel will be called upon for proper entity establishment, agreement execution, and general legal structuring. BlockTower Credit has both our own in-house counsel, and partners with Reed Smith LLP as our external counsel with access to several other law firms within the Am Law 200, including Sidley Austin LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP. This network ensures that we will have sufficient legal expertise in executing the proposal.  In addition to the third-parties noted above, we have also spent considerable time discussing our proposal and gathering feedback from relevant Maker Core Units including the Real-World Finance (RWF), Legal & Transactional Services (LTS), and Protocol Engineering (PE).  Final Words If our proposal is greenlit and successful after soliciting feedback, we look forward to engaging with the core units, delegates, token holders, and the rest of the Maker community to initiate an on-chain, senior-secured arranger model. We also recognize that, as we get the community feedback we hope to receive, this writeup will be a living document subject to revision, iteration, and eventual improvement. We\u2019re eager to continue working with the community and, as always, please let us know if there\u2019s anything that our team at BlockTower can do to illuminate or make clear any of the elements of this proposal or our firm. We\u2019ve also kept the content here quite dry, but we have ambitious goals to help DeFi reach its potential. We are always happy to go down that rabbit hole; reach out to us at [email\u00a0protected] to chat whenever.

                    "content": "Hi! Apologies for the delayed response here: The underlying assets are very short (not T-bills but absolutely could be something like trade financing, at a conservative advance rate and secured by assets). That would be the 1mo-3yr duration. The nature of our commitment, however, would be to purchase these assets on a go-forward basis (subject to good performance, which we monitor weekly) over an 18-36mo commitment. These commitments give us the flexibility to wind down our exposure much earlier if the assets are not performing, while simultaneously allowing us to scale the investment if performance remains strong (leading to more scalability for Maker vs. constantly going out and sourcing new pools of assets). Our financing agreement absolutely contains operating covenants (which we define with the originator we finance, according to very strict parameters that we design to protect our principal). This is between BlockTower, actively managing the portfolio of assets, and the originator we finance. The 30% junior capital (TIN), however, will be codified through the Centrifuge contract. We created this writeup to explain how this works, but effectively the Tinlake platform will never allow our capital to drop below 30% junior capital (the minimum subordination percentage). And you saw the update on Centrifuge Insights! But we will also be providing ongoing performance reporting + commentary to the community separately in the forums (to the extent not sufficiently covered in Centrifuge Insights). ",

As @flipflopflapdelegate kindly brought up, Centrifuge Insights will be a product that should bring a lot of transparency in permissionless/low friction fashion. That being said, we intend to provide full commentary + performance updates directly on the forum as well! In many cases, as active managers of these portfolios, we can provide qualitative context that gives the community a deeper understanding of the numbers ",
