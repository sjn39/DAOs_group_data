What exactly did you test and confirm, Wintermute? Please provide transparency on this. Question 2: Now the attacker has 19 M OP tokens in his wallet. You claim you will buy an equivalent amount whenever the attacker sells. Why dont you make an open offer to the attacker - Attacker sends you 19 M OP, you send them equivalent USDC/ETH whatever they want. Solves this issue at once. Please let us know. ",

Not that I know the Wintermute\u2019s team like I know that of Optimism and I still question Wintermute\u2019s transparency on the 2 separate test tx confirmed but one thing is for sure, If Optimism itself confirms and announces that Wintermute will be doing just that anytime he sells and has done that when he sold 1M $OP, then if I can\u2019t believe Wintermute, I can at least give Optimism a chance. Telling the Wintermute to offer an equivalent amount of the OP in USDC or ETH will only be writing off the \u201cIF\u201d in the statement \u201cIf he eventually sells\u201d. The truth is, no one prays he dumps them all and draining liquidity, it can cause price volatility. He sold 1M $OP already and I think it\u2019s a win for him also. Pressing this idea into his skull(who knows if he\u2019s reading) would be a total loss on both Optimism and Wintermute when in fact, what they want is a win-win. ",
