IMHO, if anybody is free to build everything one can imagine, then we should not talk about Standard, we should talk about DesignPattern. A Standard is something, that MUST be umplemented exact as described. For some reason. For example, the ERC20 interface (and protocol) is a Standard because exchanges and wallets need an unified and standard interface to handle any ERC20 compliant token. In contrast, the ERC20 implementation,  is a Design Pattern, because it can be changed without compatibility to existing Wallets and Exchanges. It important to separate Standards from Design Patterns because we MUST agree only on Standards, but for Design Patterns a roughly consensus is enough. Therefore, may I ask you, what kind of 3rd party players like exchanges, wallets and so on need the ERC888 as a Standard? What UseCase needs it? unclear. ",
