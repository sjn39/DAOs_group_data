Paragraph Summary MIP82 onboards a DAI 500M RWA vault that will acquire USDC via the PSM and provide a USDC Loan backed by Eth/Btc to Coinbase. The loan is expected to be split in three terms: 6, 9 and 12. The legal, structural, and technical set-up will be \u201cclose cousins\u201d of the structure and technical implementation under MIP65 and will be executed under a strict verification program.  Component Summary MIP82c1: Collateral Design This component contains the proposed loan/collateral key terms and legal structure. MIP82c2:  Verification Conditions for Collateral Onboarding This component sets out the verification mechanism and conditions ensuring appropriate collateral is onboarded using an appropriate legal structure and governance framework using an appropriate technical solution. MIP82c3: Final Terms Poll This component sets out how the final key terms of the collateral are proposed and approved/denied. MIP82c4: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding This component contains the technical requirements for unambiguous technical execution of the collateral onboarding.  Motivation  We wish to further activate the holdings of USDC on Maker\u2019s balance sheet. In collaboration with Coinbase we have found a solution that:  Remains liquid (max 48h to full liquidation). Transaction remains in crypto (USDC Loan w/ Crypto Collateral backing). Brings meaningful yield to Maker. Exchanges USDC underlying counter party risk for a direct Coinbase lending risk that is 125% over-collateralized with Eth/Btc and collateral sit with a third-party custodian. Is scalable     Specification / Proposal Details  774\u00d7517 345 KB  Picture AI\u2019ed w/nightcafe.studio  MIP82c1: Collateral Design c1.1 Legal structure and Governance Monetalis will reuse the BVI trust and governance structure developed and verified under MIP65, but set up an independent trust (via Deed) within this structure to hold the assets under this MIPXX. The below structure chart set this out with the new component in yellow:  image925\u00d7620 73 KB  This above-established structure (Trustee: James Asset PTC Limited) has today a Prime Broker International Account relationship with Coinbase and will be the counterparty for the lending agreement with Coinbase on behalf of the SPV trust for this MIP82 (Moneypenny Asset Trust). A separate Coinbase Account wallet ETH address, connected to above structure and lending agreement, must be provided and used to construct the smart contracts necessary to complete the onboarding process specified in MIP82c4. c1.2 Lending Arrangement Key Terms c1.2.1 Lending Agreement     Component Key Terms     Parties - Coinbase Custody International Limited, IRL as Borrower - James Asset PTC Limited, BVI (Trustee) for Moneypenny Asset Trust (Trust) as Lender   Amount 200,000,000.00 to 500,000,000.00 Exact amount to be proposed and approved according to MIP82c3    Use of Funds Facilitate Coinbase\u2019s financing business activities   Currency USDC   Term Loan expected split into 3 equally sized tranches (\u2153) with different lock-up terms: 6, 9 and 12 months.   2 weeks ahead of a term period ending, Coinbase will propose new interest rates for another period - and Maker can accept or liquidate accordingly.Exact tranching and terms to be proposed and approved according to MIP82c3    Liquidation Any of the term lending tranches can be fully liquidated within 48 hours.   Interest Expected to be within the range of 4.5% to 6% and interest will be paid monthly Exact interest rate to be proposed and approved according to MIP82c3 .   Collateral Conditions - Eth and/or Btc will be used as Collateral - 125% target collateralization ratio with a requirement of collateral top-up when ratio reaches 120% and allowed collateral take-out when ratio reaches 130% - Collateral valued daily and marked-to-market - Collateral will be custodied with a regulated third-party Crypto Custodian provider as agreed by both parties. (Anchorage, Bank Sygnum and other institutional custodians are in the consideration set at this moment) Exact Collateralization terms to be proposed and approved according to MIP82c3    Early Termination Interest Rebasing In case of early termination, of any of the term tranches, a refund payment must be made to Coinbase, that rebases the interest earned during the term period upto early termination date downwards to an average overnight interest rate.  This Interest Rebase Rate is expected to be in the range of 1.5% to 3% Exact interest rebase rate to be proposed and approved according to MIP82c3     c1.2.2 Arrangement Agreement W/Monetalis & Structure Cost estimations Fees and costs will be deducted from the loan\u2019s interest income.

This includes legal review of the loan agreement with Coinbase Custody International Limited, the custodial arrangements for the ETH/BTC collateral, and any other agreements. c2.2 Lending Arrangement Key Terms Verification Requirements The Strategic Finance Core Unit Facilitator must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the Lending Agreements Business Terms & Risks ensuring the appropriateness of this USDC allocation for Maker and its ALM strategy. c2.3 Technical Verification Requirements The Collateral Engineering Services Facilitator must, through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the technical appropriateness of the MIP21 designed solution in accordance with the Collateral Onboarding process (\u201cCOB\u201d). Should any one of the above verifications not be forthcoming, for whatever reason, this MIP will not move forward in the COB.  MIP82c3: Final Terms Poll The week before the executive proposal is slated to be voted on, The Governance facilitators will submit a Final Terms Poll in which key terms from MIP82c1.2, that references MIP82c3, will be finally, exactly, proposed. if the Final Terms Poll fails, Monetalis may submit up to 2 further Final Term Sheet Polls following the same structure. Should all Final Terms Polls fail, the MIP will not move any further.  MIP82c4: Technical Conditions of the Collateral Onboarding The technical implementation must follow the MIP21 framework. Upon Collateral Engineering Services solution Verification in MIP82c2, the relevant smart contracts must be constructed and deployed. The ETH Address emitted by the legal structure specified in MIP82c1 should only be changeable by MakerDAO Governance, and follow the MIP21 framework. These smart contracts must only allow for the generation of Dai or USDC through a vault that is sent to the ETH address of the legal structure as its ultimate destination, and it must not be technically possible to send the Dai or USDC elsewhere, in accordance with MIP21. There must also not be any additional technical features or complexity that goes beyond the minimum necessary smart contracts and dummy constructs to enable the generation of Dai and its transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure. The ability to initiate the generation of Dai or USDC from the vault and trigger their transfer to the ETH Address emitted by the legal structure is given to an Ethereum address controlled by Monetalis. This address must have no ability to access the funds. When the collateral onboarding process for MIP82 has progressed to step 7 in the COB, an executive vote must be created (or code must be bundled into a broader executive vote) that activates all permissions for the vault to be onboarded based on the smart contracts specified in MIP82c4. The vault must provide:  Debt Ceiling as determined in MIP82c3 . Stability Fee of 0% (surplus is paid manually through the legal structure, as specified in MIP82c1) All other parameters must be set to ensure they have no functional impact.  ",

                    "content": " Summary This is a summary of the contents of this proposal and its impact, from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  This is a proposal to lend up to 500M USDC to Coinbase Custody with ETH or BTC held as collateral. The precise technical specification is not listed, but this could either be achieved through transfer of USDC from the PSM to the arranger, or through use of a vault to generate DAI which is then exchanged for USDC held within the PSM. The target collateralization ratio is 125% and the expected interest rate is between 4.5% and 6%. The actual interest rate for the loan will be proposed periodically by Coinbase and Governance may either accept and continue, or liquidate the vault. Unlike a typical vault, the collateral is held off-chain by a third party, the debt is in USDC, and interest on the loan is paid by Coinbase in USDC. The RWA implementation is closely related to MIP65 but legal work is required to verify the legality and appropriateness for holding collateral in this structure. This proposal requires technical work based on the structure of MIP21 to develop smart contracts with appropriate permissions and security to enable this lending structure. If this MIP is ratified, a final terms poll will be submitted prior to inclusion of the lending structure in an executive proposal. This will include the results of legal and technical assessments and a final stability fee agreement. A final terms poll may be submitted up to three times, if it fails three times, no further work will be done on this proposal. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here. This proposal is eligible to the October Governance Cycle.

                    "content": "@Allan_Pedersen can I ask a couple of questions? Pardon my ignorance about RWA structures and MIP21.  If Maker decides to liquidate the vault because of unsatisfactory interest terms or because of undercollateralization due to sudden price drops, how would it work exactly since the collateral is held by a third party? I assume there is also no liquidation penalty in this case and we cannot use our keeper system. How long does Coinbase have to top-up collateral if it falls below 120% before liquidations kick in? At the end of each period, does Coinbase ultimately repay the USDC loan back into the PSM in this structure?  Thanks! ",

                    "content": "HI @AstronautThis   If Maker decides to liquidate the vault for whatever reason, MKR holders just need to vote in a MakerDAO resolution that instructs the trustee to liquidate the loan and pay the proceeds to the right Maker address. This proposed loan is on 6, 9 and 12 months terms (and interest rate paid by Coinbase commensurate) and should Maker decide to terminate some parts of the loan earlier than the above terms, then there is a rebasing of interest rate of the early terminated loan to something similar to an \u201covernight interest rate\u201d - I reckon that is sort of a penalty if you like - see the \u201cEarly Termination Interest Rebasing section\u201d.   It works pretty much like a traditional over-collateralized loan: As soon as the collateral ratio drops below 120%, the loan would be in breach and we can ask it repaid. If no repayment is forthcoming from the borrower we can essentially \u201crepay ourselves\u201d from the collateral that we have locked up with a third-party custodian through liquidation. And in the extreme event where the collateral is not sufficient to cover the loan repayment, the remainder continues as a claim against the borrower.   Before the end of each term, Coinbase can offer Maker a new interest rate for extending the loan for another period. If Maker accepts the new interest rate, the loan continues (but with new interest rate) - if Maker does not, then the loan ends and is repaid to the Vault/PSM.   ",

The underlying markets of this opportunity have, rather dramatically, changed over the past few months:  Substantial less lending demand for crypto investing Substantially more expensive crypto collateral  As a result, an implementation of MIP82 in today\u2019s market, could likely produce unattractive yields for Maker compared to today\u2019s alternatives. In addition, the immediate unfolding FTX/Alameda situation adds an uncomfortable new layer of unknowns to crypto asset markets and their movements. For these reasons, in agreement with Coinbase and the relevant Maker teams, we have collectively chosen to hit the pause button. It plainly seems the most prudent course of action. We want to make it very clear that the operational implementation of MIP82 hit no rocks or insurmountable challenges - all relevant teams have progressed the implementation on schedule and with appropriate professionalism and resources. This pause is solely dictated by market circumstances and yield/return expectations. We will remain in contact with Coinbase on this opportunity and will keep the community informed - and of course resurface the opportunity, immediately, if/when the relevant markets should move back into a position of attractiveness for Maker. We thank the community for supporting MIP82 and the teams in Maker, Coinbase and Anchorage for working on the implementation. ",
