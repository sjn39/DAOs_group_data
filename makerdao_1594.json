Paragraph Summary This SPF reimburses the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) team for advancing funds to @christiancdpetersen for the legal work he is doing on MIP65.  Motivation MIP65 was approved by the Maker community but has been stalled for some weeks due to the lack of work on the legal front. @christiancdpetersen accepted to work on it, but so far funding isn\u2019t secured despite best attempts of CES. SF-001 has decided to advance the funds and is asking for reimbursement to pay for regular order of business.  Special Purpose Fund Name Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials  The scope is strictly limited to funding legal  work by external legal teams relating to onboarding of MIP65. The scope of work will be to conduct an legal review including, among other things:  Review of the legal structures in BVI (trust and LLC). Review of the resolution, wordings and workflow. Review of the agreement between entities and services providers. Writeup of a Legal Structure and Governance Appropriateness Verification. Other open legal review questions identified along the way.   The deliverable will be a Legal Structure and Governance Appropriateness Verification to be ratified by a Facilitator according to MIP65.  @christiancdpetersen is the brain behind the RWA Foundation and knows MakerDAO governances needs quite well. There is no one better suited for this task.   Funding Breakdown  On funding, SPF will be used to reimburse SF-001\u2019s advance to pay for a scope-limited legal due diligence relating to onboarding bIBTA as a vault type. Excess funds will be held in the multisig until the work is complete. Unspent funds will be returned to the Surplus Buffer.
