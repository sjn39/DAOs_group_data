                    "content": "Recent Core Unit budget proposals have included MKR to be able to recruit and retain personnel. This prompted a forum discussion which quickly distilled into a choice for the protocol as a whole. Either the core units make separate proposals involving MKR, or there would be an overall guideline for the whole community. As a response members of the community initiated a working group with two core unit facilitators, Derek and LongForWisdom, as well as two representatives for the MKR holders Aes and Planet_X. The group initiated discussions to produce a guideline for MKR compensation for the Core Units. The advantage of guidelines The time and effort of Core Units are highly valuable to the community and while budget proposals involving MKR could be customized for each Core Unit, such an approach has the downside of consuming considerable time. There is also the aspect of avoiding creating diverging incentives as these could lessen the cohesion of the community. Additionally, the discrete yes/no nature of voting meant that some units might get everything they ask for while others end up with nothing. Given these considerations, the MKR Compensation Group believes a common guideline for MKR compensation to be highly preferable. The necessity of a system The simplest compensation system would be to give the same amount of MKR to everyone. However, the amounts necessary would make MKR an inflationary asset. Additionally, this structure would not aid retention or recruitment in critical core units while likely creating a tsunami of applications and proposals for most other units. The expectations for future MKR distribution as the organization grows would be enormous. Last but not least, such a distribution proposal would likely be impossible to sell to MKR holders. With uniform distribution scrapped, we needed a way to evaluate the Core Units; ultimately deciding on the parameters of maintenance, growth, security, and market demand for personnel. Maintenance. Peg stability, continued operation, evaluation, engagement Growth. Awareness, education, promotion, presentation, content, integrations, scaling, collateral onboarding Security. Assessment of risks, audits, regulation Staffing. Difficulty to attract, retain, or replace team members The group researched the bonus structures of world-leading technology companies. The results showed that there were huge differences in the bonuses offered to different groups of employees with software engineers offered compensation packages more substantial than even senior managers of other categories. This meant that any compensation plan taking staffing issues into account is bound to be heavily skewed in favour of the leading software developers. This is a basic fact of life which the Maker community will need to take into account. Proposed compensation for other Core Units were taken from ballpark corresponding positions at world leading tech companies or investment banks. Rounding was upwards. Additional research revealed that positions could be grouped roughly into four tiers, which matched fairly well with the discussed evaluation made of the Core Units. The net result was a compensation guideline that both fulfills the requirement of offering globally competitive compensation for critical Core Units, but also seeks to reward all contributors with a share of the Maker protocol. How it would work Different structures of compensation were discussed. The group converged on that MKR would be used for the guideline, not DAI or the dollar value of MKR. This was both due to the high degree of alignment with protocol as well as the low governance overhead involved. The guideline proposes that MKR is transferred to the Core Unit Facilitator based on the number of full-time equivalent contributors in the unit. The Facilitator will then distribute the compensation to their team based on the situation that is most applicable to that specific unit. A small team with limited plans for growth could choose to divide the compensation equally, while a team with plans to recruit substantially with high demand for training and uncertain individual performance could choose a tiered system. This method was chosen to allow for simplicity for the Community as well as flexibility for the Core Units. Any funds not spent should be returned to the community. The MKR will be transferred to the Core Unit a full year after ratification of the guideline and once per year after that until the last transfer in 2025. Proposed Compensation NB: Some listed Core Units have yet to be approved. Others have yet to formally apply for approval. Unit sizes uncertain in some cases.  Core Unit Compensation824\u00d7393 62.1 KB  Recommended best practice for Core Units Based on internal discussions the MKR Compensation Group has the following list of best practices for Core Units seeking to apply for MKR compensation.  Core Units receiving MKR are advised to adhere to this guideline when possible. The MKR compensation proposal should be placed in a separate proposal, not combined with the initial budget request. This allows a new team to start working for Maker and pay salaries to the team members. There should be a minimum 3-month gap between core unit approval and the application for MKR compensation. This will allow the community a chance to evaluate the core unit before compensating the unit with MKR.  The MKR Compensation Guideline towards 2025 It is the intention to inspect and if necessary revise the guideline annually towards 2025 while maintaining the core principles of the document to provide a firm foundation for recruitment and retention. Periodic revisions will also enable the community to include lessons learned both from inside and outside the Maker community. Do note that as the protocol progresses, working for the various Core Units will most likely increasingly resemble a normal job with proportionally less risk and also less compensation. For the purpose of establishing a DAI value to the MKR used for compensation, the price is set to DAI 2250 per MKR, which was the price of MKR on 3 March 2021 when the Protocol Engineering group submitted their budget proposal. Team composition All participants have been critical for the creation of this guidelines. With internal discussions largely concluded and recommendations made, Planet_X will promote the guideline towards the community, due to concerns around neutrality and conflict of interest for LFW and Derek. The presented proposal, including all argumentation, ranking, and figures, is therefore considered the work of Planet_X. Questions, comments, praise, or criticism should be directed there. Team composition for future revisions of the guideline will be up to the community. Feedback appreciated. Further work Based on this Pre-MIP and community feedback, a MIP will be formalized for RFC on 12 May 2021, intended for the June governance cycle. ",

You state that it is your intention to inspect this guideline annually up until 2025 and you used the DAI price of 2250 per MKR for your calculation. Can we then assume that based on job risk/function and a price appreciation of MKR by 10x to 22500 in one year for illustrative purposes, that this compensation guideline would also go down by 10x? As the price of MKR has already increased by 2x since the PECU Budget Proposal, what do you see as the implications going forward for them and all successive core unit vesting structures? The PECU has a 4 year MKR compensation plan. Do you see most of the other Core Units also having similar vesting schedules? How do we structure MKR compensation so that if we approve budget proposals for MKR vesting of 4 years and MKR appreciates 5-10x each year that the amount of MKR minted would reduce? Is it a feature to lock in a MKR compensation price per DAI for 4 years? ",

Having a common framework and a planned reevaluation at a set time in the future will help avoid recurring discussions on the topic. Could you expand on what you learned by looking at existing compensations plans? I would have naively expected compensation to be denominated in absolute USD amounts or as a % of salary, with MKR:DAI updated bi-yearly (say March&September 3rd of each year). Otherwise, whether MKR price is multiplied or divided by e.g. 4 between now and next year, sticking to the price as of March 3rd, 2021 would not make much sense for next year\u2019s compensation. ",

We made very different choices so it will be interesting to compare the two.

Or would multiple, for example, legal core units, fall in the same tier?   The 50 team members in SES, is this counting members in the incubation program, or what is this number based on?   ",

The results showed that there were huge differences in the bonuses offered to different groups of employees with software engineers offered compensation packages more substantial than even senior managers of other categories.   Just looking at levels.fyi show that Product Designers gets as much as Software/Hardware Engineers for the same level. For Amazon, Software get 3x more than Sales not 8x. It is the opposite for Microsoft where sales are more important.

These questions about which Core Units belong in which tiers is the reason I\u2019ve previously suggested having less tiers and since I\u2019ve heard several people echo the sentiment, I\u2019d like to know why the working group chose to settle on four?   Part of the reason we set up this working group is to avoid conflicts of interest. I won\u2019t deny that the compensation plan should skew towards developers but it\u2019s apparent that the interests of developers have been represented far better than others. I\u2019d like to see transparency regarding the research into bonus structures and compensation packages that suggest top engineers receive 8-9x (or 25x) the value of top marketing professionals.

It is not that Tier 2 have substandard compensation, far from it, it is just that A-grade devs are compensated on a level that no other group can compare with.     SebVentures:  Why is Smart Contracts 2 tier 3. Are we expecting PE to employ peoples 8x more useful/hard to hire on an ongoing basis?

Planet_X:  Tier 1 is so different from Tier 2 because the real world compensation packages are really very different.   Either smart contract engineers are hard to hire or they are not. And we still haven\u2019t seen evidence of that. I suggested data that anyone can check (regarding the software engineer claim, levels.fyi). You can also check the job listing of Element Finance.  image778\u00d7154 18.6 KB  I feel that judgment on perceived value is used. It feels like you expect everyone on the PE team to be A performers but peoples on SC2 to be \u201caverage\u201d players. What if SC2 is @rain (the biggest contributor in Maker MCD repo), @equivrel and @banteg ? In the discussions (not this WG), I heard at least twice that my team should be lower-tier but as the team does a good job it could go in a better tier (and probably because I was in the chat as well). So I understand that content production is not important for the DAO. Yet, a few tweets lead me to a meeting with the CEO of a $70+B asset manager tomorrow. Is Governance Communication Tier 4 if they bring great family offices to invest billions in MakerDAO, be active in the governance, and secure the hat? We might end up with a Pygmalion effect where non-Tier 1 teams see their job as not really important for MakerDAO anyway and do an average job. Excluding SES, 2 teams get 80% of all MKR, meaning governance assume they will create 80% of the future value. Maybe MKR compensation should be based on team merits and credentials and not just on the team name. It\u2019s not far from what is being proposed here. That might lead to good teamwork to go to higher tiers. For sure, this is not an easy topic. ",

On the contrary, starting to work in parallel will improve the dangerous situation where a single heavily burdened team is solely responsible for the protocol\u2019s security.

                    "content": " Preamble MIP#:53 Title: The MKR Compensation Guidelines Author(s): @Planet_X Contributors: @Derek, @LongForWisdom, @Aes, @Planet_X Tags: General Type: General Status: Withdrawn Date Proposed: 2021-11-05 Date Ratified: TBA Dependencies: Replaces:   References  Pre-MIP discussion   Sentence Summary MIP53 describes how MKR will be used to recruit, retain and align interest in the Maker community.  Paragraph Summary MIP53 details the annual amount of MKR each Core Unit will get for internal distribution among it\u2019s members. The guidelines seeks to replace individual proposals from Core Units for MKR compensation. The guidelines intends to both fulfill the requirement of offering globally competitive compensation for critical Core Units, but also seeks to reward all contributors with a share of the Maker protocol.  Component Summary MIP53c1: How the MKR Compensation Guidelines work Describes the MKR guidelines proposal. MIP53c2: Proposed Compensation per Core Unit Describes the proposed amounts of MKR going to each Core Unit. MIP53c3: Recommended best practice Describes recommended practices by the Core Units. MIP53c4: The MKR Compensation Guidelines towards 2025 Describes the planned evolution of the guidelines. MIP53c5: Amending the MKR Compensation Guidelines  Motivation Maker needs to recruit and retain personnel for its Core Units, and additionally align incentives across the community. To this purpose compensating Core Units with MKR has been chosen. While budget proposals involving MKR could be proposed by each Core Unit separately and customized for each Core Unit, such an approach has the downside of consuming considerable time and resulting in much complexity. There is also the aspect of avoiding creating diverging incentives as these could lessen the cohesion of the community. Additionally, the discrete yes/no nature of voting meant that some units might get everything they ask for while others end up with nothing. Given these considerations, a common guideline for MKR compensation is highly preferable.  Specification / Proposal Details MIP53c1: How the MKR Compensation Guidelines work The guideline proposes that MKR is transferred to the Core Unit Facilitator based on the number of full-time equivalent contributors in the unit. The Facilitator will then distribute the compensation to their team based on the situation that is most applicable to that specific unit. A small team with limited plans for growth could choose to divide the compensation equally, while a team with plans to recruit substantially with high demand for training and uncertain individual performance could choose a tiered system. This method was chosen to allow for simplicity for the Community as well as flexibility for the Core Units. Any funds not spent should be returned to the community. The MKR will be transferred to the Core Unit a full year after ratification of the guideline and once per year after that until the last transfer in 2025. MIP53c2: Proposed Compensation per Core Unit Some of the below listed Core Units have yet to submit for unit approval. Other Core Units have provisional unit size. Units not included in the below list could be proposed at a later stage through amendment.  Core Unit Compensation824\u00d7393 62.1 KB  MIP53c3: Recommended best practice Based on internal discussions the MKR Compensation Group has the following list of best practices for Core Units seeking to apply for MKR compensation.  Core Units receiving MKR are advised to adhere to this guideline when possible. The MKR compensation proposal should be placed in a separate proposal, not combined with the initial budget request. This allows a new team to start working for Maker and pay salaries to the team members. There should be a minimum 3-month gap between core unit approval and the application for MKR compensation. This will allow the community a chance to evaluate the core unit before compensating the unit with MKR.  MIP53c4: The MKR Compensation Guidelines towards 2025 It is the intention to inspect and if necessary revise the guideline periodically towards 2025 while maintaining the core principles of the document to provide a firm foundation for recruitment and retention. 2025 was chosen as the horizon limit due to the high rate of change in the world of crypto which makes it exceedingly hard to plan further. Periodic revisions will also enable the community to include lessons learned both from inside and outside the Maker community. Do note that as the protocol progresses, working for the various Core Units will most likely increasingly resemble a normal job with proportionally less risk and also less compensation. For the purpose of establishing a DAI value to the MKR used for compensation, the price is set to DAI 2250 per MKR, which was the price of MKR on 3 March 2021 when the Protocol Engineering group submitted their budget proposal. MIP53c5: Amending the MKR Compensation Guidelines Describes how Maker can change the MKR Compensation Guidelines details by use of a MIP53c5 subproposal. ",

That being said, after taking some time to think closely about this, and after some private discussions with a number of stakeholders, I think we need to start over. I cannot really understand why every single CU would receive MKR. I understand that we want to reward people for their work, but Maker is likely to have the DAI to pay its CUs, who themselves can distribute them amongst their employees/contractors. MKR \u2013 particularly future MKR is worth far more than a standard total compensation package for many roles included in CUs. While I find the metrics a bit conservative to what I would value MKR at, I will direct you to the wonderful model that @Aes built just so people can play around with their own assumptions. Are we really sure that the lowest-paid full-time-equivalent in any CU outside of Shop needs $30,000 in compensation for the next year\u2019s pay on top of any DAI they draw as salary? After some discussions with large MKR holders, and more to come next week, I cannot see the logic in this. MKR as a currency for compensation should be reserved for those CUs and individual roles that we need strong alignment of incentives. Namely, the points in our workforce that can make/break the protocol in material ways. Protocol Engineering is an obvious one, as is Risk, and Oracles. CUs where they could literally break our business need this kind of minimization of the principal-agent problem. There are also CUs that can materially improve our business \u2013 RWF and Growth \u2013 that MKR compensation is appropriate, but only if tied to performance. The guidelines proposed above would dilute current MKR holders to the tune of nearly 1.3% \u2013 annually. In today\u2019s prices, that is $46 million in additional expenses. If there is price appreciation \u2013 and we all hope there will be \u2013 that number will balloon. In a standard financial statement, that would be a line item expense. Just because we would not be paying DAI does not make that expense any less. That is almost 30% of our estimated profits for this year, and >24% of our revenue. If Maker were a publicly traded company, there would only be three large companies on the NASDAQ or NYSE that pay out a greater share of their revenue in stock \u2013 SNAP, UBER, and SNOW. Note that those are all unprofitable or only marginally profitable companies, and they need the currency of their equity to meet compensation expenses. Maker does not at present have these issues. That kind of wholesale payment of contractors/employees with our governance token is not appropriate for a cash-flow-positive, profitable enterprise. If people need payment \u2013 even extremely large payment \u2013 it can be done in DAI. MKR should be reserved for incentive alignment, and if we are all being honest, not every person doing the DAO\u2019s business is so mission critical that they need more alignment than a steady paycheck. I do not have an alternative proposal for exact amounts of MKR to vest with any particular unit, but I will strongly suggest that any CU whose allocation is not zero needs to be thoroughly justified. I am not aware of any large, profitable enterprise where literally everyone gets the equivalent of stock (not even options!) As this proposal stands now, and after some lengthy discussion with both large MKR holders and stakeholders in several CUs, I will be leading opposition to this level of MKR compensation. Thank you to everyone who worked on this proposal who probably already had to deal with many contentious discussions \u2013 you had a nearly impossible job, and exceeded expectations. ",

The DAO has a problem with treating large financial outlays nonchalantly. Yes, this information was in plain sight for anyone with 5 minutes and pencil and paper. But not only is this expense material to our earnings, it would more than double current expenditures for the year \u2013 all without even acknowledging that fact. The main quarrel is with the level of MKR compensation expenditure. If MKR appreciates significantly, it could be a larger expenditure than our total profits. My own feelings \u2013 and of several with whom I have discussed this with \u2013 are that it\u2019s less important how MKR gets distributed than it is about reigning in expenses. A secondary point would be to tie MKR to milestones when possible, to make them performance based. That said, I do not personally have the MKR to move a vote in any direction, so I would direct defenses of distributing MKR to the tune of 30 cents on the DAI we are projected to earn (in today\u2019s MKR and today\u2019s profit estimates, both of which will surely rise) towards those who can. And at least some of them are unsatisfied with how casually large expenses are treated in general, and that the largest expenditure to date would not be clearly marked as such. In general, there perhaps needs to be some kind of reminder when presenting this kind of large expense to clearly state an estimate of how much that will be. In this case, there is not even a highlighted total MKR line. While I\u2019m sure that\u2019s an oversight and we can all do addition, engagement with this kind of dense reading does not appear to be very high, and people skim. A proposed expense of $46 million in today\u2019s prices \u2013 which are well off the highs and I think we can all agree represents an under appreciated value \u2013 needs to be clearly marked as such and discussed with that in context. To reiterate, I will be campaigning actively against this level of overall MKR compensation on an annual basis. It should not be this high, it should not be connected to headcount instead of to the individual units, and it should not be 100% divorced from performance. I do not think this will pass in its current form, and recommend revision \u2013 with the total expenditure being the real intractable issue, and all other details considerably less important. ",

OK. You are probably aware of that Protocol Engineering budget passed so the question is more the level of compensation, not compensation as such.     PaperImperium:  compensation is appropriate, but only if tied to performance.   Performance based compensation was discussed in the working group, but the problem lies in the practicality of execution. Growth CU can\u2019t really brag about their business development work if they work under a non-disclosure agreement. Oracle CU can\u2019t be judged purely on the number of number of oracles they onboard, there are cost and quality issues that must be considered. If Protocol Engineering\u2019s performance is measured in the number of ERC20 collaterals onboarded then work on L2 bridges or RWAs could suffer. All in all Maker\u2019s present organization is likely much too young for performance based compensation. Feel free to disagree.     PaperImperium:  In this case, there is not even a highlighted total MKR line.   Ah - my bad. Will fix.     PaperImperium:  I do not think this will pass in its current form, and recommend revision \u2013 with the total expenditure being the real intractable issue, and all other details considerably less important.   I welcome your opposition! I have already some thoughts about revision - for example the proposed 3-month lag before a new CU can apply for MKR compensation is probably much too short. You feel the amounts are too high? Yes - they are high. Yes - that is a lot of money. But I feel this MIP \u201cboth fulfills the requirement of offering globally competitive compensation for critical Core Units, but also seeks to reward all contributors with a share of the Maker protocol.\u201d The best ting for the whole community would be if you and your like-minded companions got together and ironed out a counter proposal including argumentation. Then we simply vote on it. ",

I can\u2019t speak for others about a specific level, but a total pool of MKR that is distributed to the CUs \u2014 who can internally decide its per-person distribution\u2014 seems the best course. So while I know it is unhelpful not to have a number to counter with, this one is too high. Also, it should not be based upon headcount, as then there is an incentive for a CU to accumulate extra bodies in low-level positions as a means of being assigned more MKR. Lower overall expenditure is the main suggestion. This would more than double proposed expenses for the year. That seems too high. ",

Would you mind adding to your table (if this information is known) the compensation in DAI on a per person basis in each CU?   It might also be worth adding some information about the last known Foundation-era budgets for each of these CUs as well as how many staff they had back then. This would give a much better picture of average compensation rates before vs how they are expected to be according to our plans for the future.   About this comment     Planet_X:  You are probably aware of that Protocol Engineering budget  passed so the question is more the level of compensation, not compensation as such.   I thought the Protocol Engineering team budget (including MKR compensation) was already fixed since the vote passed. If so, is the level of MKR compensation under discussion only for the remaining CUs? Thank you! ",

(Contract) This time locked contract still has 23371 MKR in it and there are addresses which actively do withdraw their allotted balances from it. https://etherscan.io/address/0xfc7e22c6afa3ebb723bdde26d6ab3783aab9726b (Transaction) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5ae2682f29621cdf62e635e5656245c16e9e57226e9b8121228ca67b9e3c0745 I would be interested to know if any CU are double dipping between their prior agreements and the future compensation guidelines we are discussing.
