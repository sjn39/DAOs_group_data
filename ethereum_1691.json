However, I am slightly confused how I should upgrade here. As I understand correctly, I should query by path, but since I don\u2019t have the full trie then I cannot query said path, only partial paths? Am I correct that the path here is the path in the trie? (So starting from root we move down the trie in order to reach an account leaf) EDIT: Maybe I\u2019m wrong here, and path is actually the path in the trie? So it would work the same as GetNodeData?
