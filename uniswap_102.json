It is not on mainnet yet for this reason.) The idea behind this contract is to limit the amount of money the fund can use to a set amount temporarily. If more money is needed, a proposal could be created that would call the increaseSpendLimit function to increase the amount of money that could be withdrawn. Finally, if Uniswap Governance decides that the money isn\u2019t being spent well, the funds could be recalled by calling the recallFunds method. There is obviously no way to force the funds to be sent to this address if this proposal passes, but we hope that the signers are nice enough (and care about transparency enough) to send the funds to the contract.

Also we shouldn\u2019t forget an option to just sell if we feel that DAO interests have significantly diverged from ours, I don\u2019t believe it is the case yet. delegate to wijuwiju.eth ",
