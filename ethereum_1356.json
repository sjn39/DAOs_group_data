We hope to present it to you at Berlin Council. DGOV 2018 will provide a meeting point for the distributed consensus technologists, policy-makers, academics and practitioners to learn and share experience in self-organised organisations. It is a forum for interdisciplinary debate on the most pressing problems the world confronts nowadays and on problem solving capacity that new digital technologies offer.
