Users must borrow at least this amount to open a vault, and cannot repay their debt below this amount unless they pay off the entire remaining balance. Higher dust values make vaults less accessible for smaller users, but also protect Maker from risk of vaults being too small to liquidate profitably. You can learn more in the documentation here 3.  Background and proposal The last time dust parameters were changed was back in December '21 and before that again was May of \u201921. Since then, gas prices have fallen substantially. With sentiments in crypto cooling and a general expectation of a bear market setting in it might be time again to analyse and possibly change the dust limit of our vaults.  image940\u00d7242 35.8 KB  Source: ycharts I want to put the question to the community on whether it thinks we should put in the effort to optimize the dust limits. Pros:  We get a fresh evaluation and know that risks are adequately accounted for. More precise current evaluation can allow us to lower dust limits to make vaults more accessible.  Cons:  Requires Risk bandwidth to do the analysis and governance bandwidth to implement.     Should Risk prioritize to update the dust limit analysis and come back with new recommendations for dust limits?

Maker might not be suitable for the low level retail market, but there can be possibilities for actors above your average retail but lower than your whales and institutions. Further more, getting medium sized actors can help with vault concentration which is a real issue. ",

Blockchains are public networks that anyone can interact with, meaning that it is highly possible that an attack would be made from an actor that does not like systems which they can\u2019t control, or possibly a profit driven attack. Such an attack would be executed during a large market drawdown as it would be most effective at that time, since DeFi protocols need to achieve new market equilibrium relevant to the spot prices each time there is a price change, need to process liquidations to remain solvent, etc. Lowering dust would mean we expect the price will never spike again, as even if you increase it later in time, old vaults which were opened by the previous dust limit will remain in the system. There is always a tradeoff between potential business expansion and safety. In this case, we would gain very little (retail would produce an insignificant amount of dai debt), but would expose the protocol and vault users to situations where closing/liquidating the position is unprofitable. Retaining and expanding retail dai borrowing users is important for other reasons than just revenue. This is why we thought about possible solutions, for example a custom lending market + D3M, but these are subject to another set of risks and we might have better opportunities to pursue. The ultimate solution is higher scalability, which is not in our control. ",

                    "content": "This has been a fairly one sided affair so far so I\u2019ll offer a few counter arguments to those currently brought forth. First; This is a signal for analysis. It doesn\u2019t present a solution but rather to get an update on input to parameters in use by the protocol today. As such it doesn\u2019t present an alternative to work being carried out on L2s. It presents possible action in the present before a future solution can be implemented. Secondly; the amount of work that goes into an updated analysis is several orders of magnitude less time consuming and technically complex than the work that goes into our L2 work. Assuming an analysis comes to the conclusion that parameters should be changed those can be implemented quickly and with minor effort. Thirdly; in response to the following:     rema:  Dust is fine as it is. Its not about the average price in the recent time period. Its about what gas could spike to in a short time period ~1h.   This is equally true with the levels we have today as it was prior to changing them in December last year as well as when they were changed in May '21. Should we not evaluate current gas conditions and spike potential? Or should the highest historic spike be the defining factor? And if so should we not evaluate if there might be an even higher spike going forward?     rema:  Lowering dust would mean we expect the price will never spike again, as even if you increase it later in time, old vaults which were opened by the previous dust limit will remain in the system.   And this needs to be tempered by the following logic; the gas costs in relation to dust limits is a product of both gwei and ETH cost. In a scenario in which gas costs increase significantly it is natural to assume that ETH price will increase as well. This means that either vaults are now more strongly collateralized or they have drawn more DAI than current dust limits.     rema:  Retaining and expanding retail dai borrowing users is important for other reasons than just revenue. This is why we thought about possible solutions, for example a custom lending market + D3M, but these are subject to another set of risks and we might have better opportunities to pursue. The ultimate solution is higher scalability, which is not in our control.   I agree, but again these are future solutions locked behind a lot more work and time. ",

I agree with @rema and others above that our existing dust parameters seem suitable for the current gas environment and protocol scaling strategy (focusing on serving retail users on L2). But, updating dust limit analysis is still valuable to help inform the Maker community\u2019s discussions on how to best serve smaller users while maintaining acceptable risk exposure. Below is an updated analysis based on recent market conditions, along with comments on existing parameters and strategy:  Gas Price Environment After elevated activity early in the year, gas prices settled into a relatively low equilibrium since March averaging around 40-50 gwei with typical variance between 20-100 gwei.  1290\u00d7490 31 KB  Source: ycharts However, there were a few notable spikes in gas price in May, driven by BAYC\u2019s highly anticipated Otherside land sale (May 1) and the Terra collapse (May 10-13). The Otherside land NFT mint and sale in particular saw some of the highest recorded Ethereum gas prices, sustaining prices well above 1,000 gwei for over an hour. This demonstrates low elasticity of the Ethereum gas market, where in periods of heightened demand prices can spike far above recent averages.  1600\u00d7882 188 KB  Source: gasprice.io  Dust Limit Review Dust Limit Analysis Sheet Recent downtrend in ETH and gas prices has given Maker relatively greater protection against losses from small vaults as compared to our last update in 2021. The figure below shows Maker\u2019s resilience against small vault insolvencies at our current 15,000 DAI dust for large caps WBTC-A and ETH-A (assumes $1750 ETH price).  1270\u00d7660 119 KB  Currently we have considerable excess protection versus the previous benchmark of accommodating 15% intra-hour price decline and 1,000 gwei gas prices for large cap assets; readjusting dust down to this level of buffer would yield 6,000 DAI dust for ETH-A and WBTC-A (60% reduction). Similar dynamics can be seen for other classes of vaults (figures below).  1000\u00d7662 103 KB   1536\u00d7654 129 KB  User costs have also come down substantially, which increases the potential utility Maker could offer to smaller sized vault users below current dust thresholds. And if users maintain high collateral, they can avoid submitting transactions during gas spikes to help optimize their cost exposure. The below chart assumes 20-30 gwei gas costs and $1750 ETH price.  1302\u00d7546 87.6 KB  Source: Vault User Gas Cost Sheet  Recommendation The combined declines in ETH price as well as average gas prices have made Maker vaults relatively more economical for small users, and given Maker greater buffers against insolvencies. But despite these changes, dust limit reductions are not recommended at this time for a few reasons. Gas cost variability Many of you may be familiar with this quote from the last bear market:   twitter.com    Zhu Su \ud83d\udd3a @zhusu  \"We will pump off the bottom extremely quickly, leaving most sideline investors stuck in fiat.\" -me twitter.com/soona/status/1\u2026   Soona @soona  \ud83d\udd2e The 2019 Crypto Crystal Ball.   We asked builders and investors in the space to play industry fortune tellers for this post - here's the full compilation of their predictions.  https://t.co/DWSmhgvk8F    4:11 AM - 21 Dec 2018           1.7K                210            The logic can apply to asset prices, but also network utilization rates. We\u2019ve seen this more recently, including in October/November 2020 and June/July 2021, where activity bottomed out before rebounding quickly. Maker can\u2019t depend on USD denominated gas prices staying at their current low levels, and the Otherside mint and Terra collapse showed that prices can still spike to extreme levels despite low recent activity (potentially the maximum gas spike potential has even increased). User experience There is broad consensus that the cost of transacting on Ethereum L1 is likely to increase over time. This is influenced by potential increase in ETH price, as well as increasing demand for L1 blockspace from rollups and high value financial transactions. So even if the cost of interacting with a Maker vault is economical for small users today, there is considerable risk that they could face high exit costs when closing their position (it\u2019s even possible their position could become \u201cstranded\u201d with equity value falling below gas cost of closing position). Given this assumed secular trend of increasing L1 transaction costs, it arguably provides little user benefit to enable smaller vault positions now. Maker\u2019s plans for L2 integrations (including L2 native vaults and D3Ms, etc) should provide a more compelling option for small users once live. It would also be negative from a user perspective to enable small vaults and then quickly be forced to reinstate higher dust limits, as this causes UX issues making it more difficult to unwind positions (debt cannot be partially repaid below dust limit).
