                    "content": " Intro @tigress , @june , and @puncar-dev would like to present our suggestions for the standardization of our project/task management process within GitcoinDAO. We genuinely believe that flexibility within workstreams and initiatives is essential, but we should all speak the same language. Here we\u2019ll focus only on core principles and keep space for specific workstream needs. This initial proposal is a request for comments \u2013 we would appreciate your view on this so we can prepare a final recommendation for the DAO (CSDO).  Problem statement The Action Items DB (Notion Database (Link)) is the centerpiece of all our project and/or task management activities at GitcoinDAO. This database should contain all the tasks and projects we are executing on. For this reason, this database must be in good shape and well maintained in terms of structure and content. Currently, every workstream uses it slightly differently, increasing the database\u2019s complexity and making it harder to set up individual instances. Therefore, we need to find an alignment between workstreams to use the database similarly and ensure consistency in the naming (the same word should mean the same across the workstreams), but keep the flexibility to ensure that the database works well for each workstream. From the DAOops perspective, all initiatives need to be able to record their tasks and projects on their board and then report on successful project completion on weekly DAOops calls. But MMM might need something slightly different; thus, we must find a flexible solution for everyone.  Project Management Structure Through analyzing the project management systems at DAOops, FDD, and MMM, we have concluded that there are two general workflows: the execution workflow, and the reporting workflow. The execution workflow refers to actions for completing work, and the reporting workflow refers to how the completed work relates to achieving objectives and key results. We suggest using the Action Items DB and the Initiatives DB (Notion Database (Link)) to manage these two workflows. Below is the overall structure:  1305\u00d71600 148 KB  The Action Items DB will contain tasks, projects, and key results. The Initiatives DB will contain initiatives and their related objectives, and are also directly linked to projects and key results from the Action Items DB. It\u2019s up to each workstream to decide how many steps they want to have in their project management process, and if they want to introduce a new tag or subcategory. However, it is vital to keep alignment on the basic structure.  Action Items DB  Action Item An Action Item is the centerpiece of the Action Items DB. This field can be used to represent tasks, projects, or both \u2013 this distinction will vary across workstreams. If used to represent a project, the field can still be used to incorporate tasks as another level of granularity. Using this field for both projects and tasks is possible by making use of filters and establishing clear relations between tasks and projects. Or, the Action Item field can be used mainly as tasks, and bundled together into projects. Alternatively Action Items can also directly relate to an Initiative. There is a lot of flexibility for WorkStreams but its important to keep the same flow:  Key Results - represents what Initiatives promised to accomplish for the budget they have been given, usually a seasonal initiative Project - break down of key results to a smaller initiatives that takes couple of weeks to complete Task - smallest piece of work that doesnt take more than couple days to complete   Templates The templates we have created will represent the various ways that Action Items can be used in the Action Items DB. Currently, there are three templates that can be used when creating an Action Item:   Project Template  A project is an Action Item within the Action Items DB that represents a multiple-week effort to be achieved. A project can contribute to successfully completing a Key Result of an Initiative. Additionally, some projects may also stand on their own (e.g. research projects), thus enabling autonomy within workstreams. Projects may contain multiple tasks; therefore, the project template enables seamless task creation from within it.  1600\u00d7303 81.5 KB   Task Template  A Task functions like a Project, but is used as an additional level of granularity. A Task can roll up and relate to a separate, larger Action Item. This can be done by marking Tasks as dependencies on a Project or Key Result. A task can be created from a project\u2019s Notion page or separately in the Action Items DB and then tagged to a project.  1498\u00d7300 31.8 KB   Key Results Template  A Key Result is the third type besides Tasks and Projects for which the Action Items DB can be used. The set of Key Results represents what Initiatives promised to accomplish for the budget they have been given and always relates to an objective. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind when executing on projects or tasks. Majority projects should contribute partially or fully to accomplishing those key results. All initiative leads should create the key results at the beginning of the season and then they can track all projects and tasks there on top of there.  1548\u00d7901 101 KB   Initiatives DB  Initiatives An Initiative is a structure in the Initiatives DB. It represents a grouping element to gather a group of people (=squad or team) around a specific objective and set of key results. An initiative has a \u201clead person\u201d which is the Initiative Owner, and others are contributors. Large initiatives are executed as a set of projects to achieve key results. Smaller initiatives might not use projects to bundle tasks and instead directly execute tasks to achieve the key results. Below, you can see an example of an initiative wide view divided by projects.  1568\u00d7600 75.1 KB   Objective An objective is a precise sentence describing what we intend to achieve by the end of the season for a given Initiative(s), and the overarching goal for an initiative. To realize and deliver option the objective a set of key results is defined.  Gitcoin Essential Intent (EI) The Gitcoin EI is situated at DAO level and represents long term \u201c30 year\u201d objectives. The EI outlineswhat we are all trying to accomplish together as a DAO, and all our activities should directly or indirectly contribute to that.  Recommendation for project & task workflow Every project or task can be in various stages, and to align on naming conventions, June and the MMM team have prepared this great workflow. FDD also uses this workflow. It is highly recommended to use these same statuses when dealing with projects and tasks, even though you might not use all of them. Creating additional statuses for a single initiative or project can create confusion in the DAO and add up to increase complexity of the Notion databases, which is to be refrained from!  Happy Path 942\u00d7284 59.1 KB    Unhappy Path  1100\u00d7619 166 KB      Status Description     Future Backlog for all projects or tasks related to the initiative(s)   Next up Prioritized projects/tasks to be started within the next two weeks   In progress Projects/Tasks that are actively being worked on   In review Projects/Tasks being reviewed (optional, only if project requires review)   Blocked Projects/Tasks that are currently blocked   On hold Deprioritized Projects/Tasks before they get back to \u201cfuture\u201d or dropped to \u201cwon\u2019t do\u201d   Done Completed Projects/Tasks (woo!)   Won\u2019t do Dropped Projects/Tasks    We would leave this proposal up whole next week for discussion and then propose a final version in about 2 weeks from now to CSDO. If ratified we would like to work with workstreams during October to incorporate those standards. Please let us know if there is anything unclear from this proposal or if you would suggest any modifications. ",

The Pareto Principle of 80% working towards achieving Initiatives and 20% explorative, emergent work seems to be feasible to me. ",

Would love to arrive at a consistent understanding of how things are done in the DAO - @CoachJonathan led a great discussion on the importance of documenting \u201chow we work\u201d in addition to just \u201cwhat we work on\u201d, and I\u2019m convinced that better processes and documentation in that realm will prevent balls from being dropped and reduce coordination failures. I\u2019d love to hear why this way of documenting and managing tasks is being suggested - in other words, what\u2019s the \u201cWhy\u201d for each of the elements of this model? Personally, I\u2019ve tried and struggled with using Notion for task management, and have created my own personal workflow that works for me (currently using a combination of Asana + Sunsama). With all process adoption proposals within a self-managing organization, I think there needs to be a strong \u201cwhy\u201d for people to switch from tools/structures/processes they are currently using. Fortunately there\u2019s a ton of research on this topic so I think we can come up with something that has been demonstrated to lead to better team and individual contributor health. ",

TLDR: it\u2019s all about coordination  @puncar\u2019s take is: if you need to track your todo only for yourself, you can and probably should track it in the tool of your choice. But when we need to cooperate or share information with each other, we need to speak the same language, otherwise, we are creating friction or we just won\u2019t understand each other. And that\u2019s why we are creating those standards, to try to establish the common language, but also to not restrict individual flexibility @june agrees with that and adds: we\u2019re striving for easier and better collaboration & it gets that much harder to do if we\u2019re not creating the same level of transparency & using the same tools/process we\u2019re def not trying to restrict individual and even workstream flexibility - just setting the foundations for each workstream to expand upon And my stance is: our ideas are borrowed from basic Kanban as a methodology to manage work in progress and enable transparency. of course there is a whole lot more which can be done with Kanban. we are touching the tip of the iceberg. and we reuse the tools, such as Notion, which are already in place and adopted by the DAO Hope I am not embarrassing you - the WHY is not that spectacular  ",
