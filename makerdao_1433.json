In the near future we want this \u201cshow\u201d along with the Delegate Office Hours to provide a visual platform for MakerDAO Delegates, that cab communicate their platform core values, delegate statement, skillsets, and views. We intend to also invite Core Unit Team Members and their Facilitators @Core-Facilitators Truthfully, we can also call this \u201cshowcase\u201d MEET THE MAKERS, as our intentions are to be communicative and add value to Decentralized Governance thinking from both CU Team Members and Delegates (Recognized, or Shadow).
