As it stands, it\u2019s time-consuming for someone who is intimately familiar with the forums to navigate to each CUs budget page to see what jobs are available and even then, the listed positions are not current. I am envisioning this as something at the top of the page that is quite clear and visible. As I\u2019ve mentioned before I think our #1 objective at this stage is to attract and retain talented individuals who can contribute to the DAO. We need to let people know the DAO is hiring! ",

The other location to look out for in the future(i expect) will be the old makerdao.com/careers site, once it is handed off and all the access/process/permissions are sorted out. There is also the forum\u2019s help wanted section, which isn\u2019t used very much. I agree, it is very fragmented and we should bring all of these together in a single location. Perhaps to start, my team can create a stickied forum thread in the help wanted section that lists all of these. ",
