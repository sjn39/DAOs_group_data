Transitioning to FT work will increase the time I\u2019ll be able to dedicate to this project for which I am incredibly passionate about and increase output tremendously. With this transition and higher bandwidth, I wanted to reach out to the community and get feedback on the below priorities and short term road map for the RWF FP&A team.  On chain OpEx reporting of actuals vs budget on @makerburn\u2019s awesome website Standardizing budgeting and financial reporting processes across the DAO (templates, models, fiscal calendar, etc) Build out \u2018Governance Relations\u2019 by partnering with CU leadership to frame and communicate MakerDAO\u2019s strategy, operational & financial results to the community Enhanced KPI reporting & dashboard Vault profitability analysis  Looking forward to reading your input!
