                    "content": "Over the past several weeks, Dharma has worked with several other DeFi projects to build a proposal for the retroactive distribution of UNI to certain Uniswap users who were excluded in the original airdrop. We are ready to submit this proposal to the Uniswap governance system, except that at the moment, only ~25m UNI votes have been delegated, which does not meet the minimum passing threshold of 40m UNI votes. So we\u2019re calling on you, the active Uniswap governance community, to delegate your votes to Dharma! As we have in the Compound community since the launch of the COMP token earlier this year, we will spearhead important technical updates, advocate for changes to protocol economics, and act as stewards for Uniswap. Uniswap\u2019s governance system is very similar to Compound\u2019s, and we believe our experience in this system prepares us well to be good governors in Uniswap as well. In fact, we submitted and passed the first ever community proposal to Compound, and have since made five proposals to the Compound Governance module. We are on track to be just as active in Uniswap. In our capacity as a Uniswap voter, we will:  Act to bring Uniswap and DeFi to the mainstream, providing a seamless and decentralized experience Rigorously evaluate proposals around technical, security, and economic considerations Transparently document our thought process and final conclusions for all votes we make  To delegate to Dharma, visit https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote and delegate your votes to: 0x7e4a8391c728fed9069b2962699ab416628b19fa Let\u2019s build Uniswap and DeFi together.

You say that \u201cI agree that it would be nice if some developers got rewarded for building products on Uniswap.\u201d \u2014 not rewarding UNI tokens to Dharma users would do the exact opposite, it would be a retroactive punishment for building products on Uniswap. You say that \u201cI believe that EVERYONE who used Uniswap prior to Sept 1 got a token airdrop\u201d \u2014 this is true only by a narrow definition of \u201cused\u201d. By a slightly more inclusive definition, all Dharma users also used Uniswap. The difference between Dharma\u2019s users and other users is an esoteric technical definition, that no user could reasonably be expected to have understood. ",
