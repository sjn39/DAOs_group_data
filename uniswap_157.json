It is time to give the economic model of uni token.   If the uni of the team needs to be sold, it can be directly traded and destroyed through repurchase, providing capital liquidity. If it is not sold, the repurchase can maintain the price appreciation, and the uni held by the team will continue to increase in value.   It is hoped that community leaders can put forward specific implementation plans after consideration and approval~ ",

I invested a lot of money into Uniswap I have lost big. Don\u2019t bother making suggestions because your voice does not get heard.
