                    "content": "hi guys , I saw the first monthly strategy call video , Monthly Strategy Review - Process Review & Discussion (Public Call on 10/26/21 1:30PM UTC) . thank you , I think it is very important to review the KPIs. I want to put forward some thoughts on strategy . kpi is the result , we need to find the drivers of growth and Competitive advantage over rivals. first , let me tell the story of Tether , although Many crypto OG despise Tether , USDT have no1 market share in stable coin. The tipping point of USDT is that China has banned fiat currency exchange . so most Chinese crypto exchange used USDT-crypto pair since 2017.  you can see the story here or google more https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/tethers-red-dragon-why-usdt-is-dominating-chinese-markets/ now , most Chinese crypto guy buy crypto will buy USDT with fiat RMB first then exchange , and as USDT have network effect , Many gray industries such as gambling use it in order to get rid of regulation . and now , I have friends who do cross-border business use USDT as payment  due to heavy bank supervision. most of USDT holder don\u2019t know the risk of USDT , they think it is just crypto dollar with broad access because the network effect . 30B USDT not in ethereum because the gas fee too high for payment user case. What I want to emphasize is that users choose a product not because of decentralization, but because it can solve the pain points of users . so we can also saw the growth driver of BUSD and USDC , are Binance Exchange and defi . second , DAI\u2019s use cases are : a) crypto loan , b) Leveraged trading , c) payment  d) store of value . Compared to usdt and usdc, Maker\u2019s core competitive advantages is low rates (no capital cost, just IP) , it is good for crypto loan , but dai exchange pair not much not good for leveraged trading . third , Let\u2019s see where the opportunities are . L1 gas fee is too high , only high value transactions occur in ethereum and ether is Currency Unit in most use cases(token exchange pair , NFTs, gamefi ) , but L2 enable more small payment use cases . the currency unit will be dominated by stablecoin . we need win this war with USDC and USDT . I think Maker can build core advantages in the following aspects\uff1a   native bridge between L1 and L2s , as DAI is crypto native and IP business , 1Dai = 1Dai at every L2 Maker support. Maker can provide unlimited market depth of DAI with 0 slippage . both ETH and USDC need third party bridge like hop when transfer between L2s. we should invest more R&D in L2 , build excellent product for users.   up ETH/DAI market depth , and make DAI the best for Leveraged trading . for trading , the cost is slippage+rates , we can use PSM 1:1 USDC as exchange proxy at start . If the market depth is the same as usdt or usdc , Maker\u2019s advantage of low interest rates is really brought into play . I know some CEX will integrate with dex on l2 , l2 will have the most market share in exchange volume , it is the opportunity Dai flipper USDT   private payment , all the L1 transactions are transparent . but as payment and sov use cases , people want private. tornato.cash is not easy for regular user , aztec is also doing as L2 . I think we can do and need better native private version on L2s .    more Ecosystem integration . I think the biggest advantage is Composability compared to usdc . D3M is very good , we need do more to use community power . and we should give the vary ethereum communtiy why use Dai but not USDC .  let\u2019s see circle\u2019s investor presentation ,  image1400\u00d7746 107 KB   image1884\u00d71046 217 KB   image1862\u00d71036 243 KB   image1858\u00d71050 163 KB  we also should know the road to expand TAM , which niche market for product fit . if USDC to 83B in 2022 and 194B in 2023 , how we compete . or how can we hit 200B Dai in 2023 . I think this year Maker will have 10B Dai , and 2022 maybe also bull market as eth merge . this year maker growth have two part : crypto lend by bull market and PSM by Volatile market . we need redistribute Dai to more people through payment and transaction ,enrich the network effect. in this bull run , crypto maybe go to 10T+ asset class, Dai as crypto m2 ,  I think it may far exceed 200b , maker have first mover advantage as first native workable stablecoin , but it need we build more product innovation to have real user value . I learned a lot from this community ,and looking forward to hearing your feedback ",
