Demand for DAI continues to exceed new supply even at 0%SF.   Arguably, one of the biggest reasons people don\u2019t want to open CDPs is that other platforms do not charge a 13% liquidation penalty (e.g. compound) to borrow DAI.  13% is way in excess of what is needed to prevent dust attacks.  I suggest we lower it to what Compound charges (5%).   The 13% penalty is keeping Maker from being competitive with other platforms for people who want to borrow DAI and its time to lower it so that we can increase DAI supply and restore the peg. ",

I think black Thursday showed though that currently the infrastructure we have built is not able to guarantee low enough slippage. ",

Maker can directly intervene in the Dai coin market. In open market operations, Maker can initially produce Dai without asset support, and then use it to buy assets such as MKR or ETH or USDC on the open market. Then use these purchased assets to support Dai (the system is still solvent at this time). At this time, the supply of Dai in the agreement will increase, and it is expected to exert downward pressure on Dai\u2019s price. ",

If this was the case then you could potentially argue that incrementally more friendly borrowing parameters would steal market share away from compound.

                    "content": "Yes. Allowing Dai to trade up to 10% above the peg for several weeks is not sustainable and significantly hampers the usefulness of Dai. We should consider asset purchase operations for the next time we encounter a liquidity crisis like March 12. It should be used with care, but peg will respond much faster and in a more predictable manner when compared to stability fee adjustments. Interestingly, signaling that we are willing to use this technique can help strengthen the peg even when the actual size of asset purchases is small or zero, as traders will be more confident in making a market above $1 when Maker governance has shown the will and ability to do so itself. It can also strengthen the value proposition of the MKR token by adding balance sheet assets. One other monetary policy tool that should be considered is the addition of a CDP type with limited debt ceiling and a low stability fee, fixed for several months. This will allow borrowers to feel more confident migrating/opening a position on Maker, as there will be less uncertainty about future monetary policy decisions forcing them to pay switching costs to another borrowing platform.
