                    "content": "What is the right balance between on-chain and off-chain collateral? Due to the bear market and the flight to safer assets, there has been tons of discussion around the PSM and its collateral. Stablecoins now generate over 70% of DAI (primarily because ETH-backed vault usage is down, increasing the percentage of USDC-backed DAI). Instead of reducing the size of DAI, as has been discussed in other posts, I propose shifting focus to core lending products (i.e., ETH-based vaults), to increase the volume of non-USDC backed assets, and therefore lower the percentage of USDC-backed assets. Prioritization Sentiment polling results agree on focus. Below, I ideate some strategies that would support core lending growth and create appropriate incentives for existing and new users. Existing ETH Backed Vaults There are currently three ETH crypto-backed vaults to select from based on user\u2019s risk, leverage and return appetite. Below is the summary from MakerBurn. ETH A -  Coll Ratio: 145% SF: 2.25% ETH B - Coll Ratio: 130% SF: 4.00% ETH C - Coll Ratio: 170% SF: 0.50% BTC crypto-backed vaults have similar options. Proposal -  Non-stablecoin vault-holder optionality Rapid crypto asset price fluctuations change market conditions in short periods of time, so vault-parameters that were favorable a few weeks/months ago may no longer be so favorable. In an attempt to retain vault-holders and/or make vaults more attractive to new users, there should be vault-holder optionality, defined as a one-time annual option to transition between same-currency vaults. In a bear market with prices declining, a client in ETH-C might be willing to move to ETH-A or ETH-B where they pay a higher fee, but avoid liquidation (and MakerDAO would benefit from retaining and increasing SF). In a bull market with prices rising, ETH-A or ETH-B clients might be willing to move to ETH-C, increasing their collateral and paying a lower fee, to reduce their SF. While MakerDAO would receive a lower fee, it would benefit from having retained these clients as they may continue to borrow at the same volume or higher in the future. Alternatively, this vault-holder optionality could be defined as a formula, whereby a one-time annual collateral ratio adjustment of 10% (TBD) adjusts the SF by X%. Lower (e.g. collateral ratio => 120%) and upper limit (e.g. collateral =<300%) collateral ratios would be determined prior to optionality launch. Potential Benefits  Higher ratio of DAI generated from ETH/BTC. Less reliance on USDC/RWA Increased vault duration and retention Pricing optimization - Should the range be 0.5% - 4.0%? Seems inefficient for both being over-collateralized, so this should be scaled in some way Align pricing to evolving market conditions in a formulaic way Better customer experience leads to longer-term and/or higher-use customers Incentivizes new vault creation Reduction in loan defaults of bad debt  Potential Risks  Temporary SF reduction Lower liquidation fees (Long-term, this is a good thing for customers) Coding execution leads to faulty migration   Screen Shot 2022-07-02 at 11.50.09 AM888\u00d7303 35.6 KB  Pulse Check    Do you think the benefits outweigh the risks?

Do you know where I would be able to track wallets that shift vaults? In order to assess if the process is being utilized. I was hoping that the process of shifting between same-currency vaults (ETH-A \u2192 ETH-C) would be more seamless and wouldn\u2019t require loan repayment and new setup, thus avoiding gas fees, since it would be an internal reassignment. Maybe this is not possible under the existing smart contract rules\u2026 but for new vaults we should probably consider things like:  Adjustable collateral ratios Variable (tied to benchmark) and fixed pricing options Bracket pricing (lower SF for higher borrowed amount) Invest excess collateral (Coll ratio - 100% Coll)  Reasoning that the ability to adjust and self-serve vault settings during shifting market conditions would attract more customers, all while remaining within established parameters.
