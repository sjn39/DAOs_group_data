                    "content": "@xinbenlv posted some excellent comments on the pull request that I think are better suited to this discussion thread:     xinbenlv:   Permissible sources MUST NOT charge a fee for accessing resources.  I love the intention but I think this block us from many academic publications. ISO standards are also charging fees.   I\u2019m perfectly fine not allowing links to these sources.      xinbenlv:   The Ethereum ecosystem is built on openness and free access, and the EIP process should follow those principles.  This is a very good intention. Rhetorically with the similar good intent, can we ban all links to any content cannot be run without a hardware (e.g. computer or phone) that is not free, or can we ban all links to any content that is centralized, such as Github?   Sure! I\u2019m all for continuing to ban external links. I just think most other people want to allow some external links. The difference between having to pay to access GitHub and having to pay to access an External Source is that once you\u2019ve paid once to download the EIPs repository, you\u2019re free to query it locally and to share it freely. Any final EIPs will continue to be available to you and anyone you choose eternally. That isn\u2019t necessarily true of external resources.     xinbenlv:  That\u2019s just a friendly joke, my real intention is to respectfully suggest not fully ban non-free content but require author to use a cheaper permissible sources whenever available. I love the direction, but the world is not perfect yet and we only get to do one step at a time. Rationale Even Wikipedia didn\u2019t make this requirement.   The EIP repository has vastly different goals than Wikipedia. I think we\u2019re free to choose our own path.     xinbenlv:  I think this reduces our ability to link to useful content.   No argument here. I\u2019m sure there are tons of useful things that this policy excludes.     xinbenlv:  At the end of day, everything charges. We might live in a first world country that getting online is not very expensive, but my phone bill is 30 dollars a day, meaning if it take me 1 minute to find the link to my EIP online, I am charged by my phone ISP for 0.00001157407 for me to access the EIP I authored. I am saying, there is nothing free. Also \u201cfree\u201d is never free, you might be paying for ads, paying for your privacy or attention. Some people might cherish their privacy or other reasons better than monetary cost.   That\u2019s all very true and applies to everything, so it\u2019s somewhat meaningless. Obviously the EIP isn\u2019t saying that you can\u2019t link to a source because you burn calories while reading it. EIP-5757 specifically says \u201cMUST NOT charge a fee for accessing resources\u201d. It specifically doesn\u2019t prohibit charging fees for, say, photocopying a book at a library. ",

Kudos for EIP-5757 This comment and its answers should not be considered as blocking merging EIP-5757 into Final I like to kindly use this case to test the EIP-5757 against the core purpose of EIP in general. Do we see EIP as a place to only publish a recognized standardize, or do we see EIP as a place for proposal and such proposal might need backing evidence that can live outside of a proposal? In a more specific case, would EIP-721 be in a better proposal if had the author and editor back then trim all links and references. A large portion of the EIP-721 draft was articulating  the prior art the existing implementations of this particular draft the solidity language implements that were made to enable what EIP-721 needs to be safe and gas efficiency  Some of those links I believe can be trimmed, but a lot of them plays an important roles in arguing for this EIP. For example, back then there were other several EIPs competing with each other aiming to be adopt as canonical. It would be hard to imagine a winning EIP could make a more competing case by pointing out adoptions and implementations, as well as upstream tool chains made to enable this EIP. This applies EIP-1155.

Shall such mentioning / reference be removed from spec under new EIP-5757? My understanding is it will be.

While implementers are free to use whatever signals they want when deciding which EIPs to implement, I don\u2019t think the EIPs repository should impose too many requirements on authors and certainly not any requirements that are non-free. Ideally we\u2019ll try to encourage authors to seek out sufficient review before Last Call, but finding reviewers is a big job.     fulldecent:  point out their flaws   We certainly appreciate all the technical feedback you provide!

Counterexample: For various legal reasons, I don\u2019t actually own any non-testnet Ethereum. I nonetheless hope that my EIPs and editing are helpful. At the very least, nobody has recently told me anything that suggests otherwise. I\u2019m actually more concerned about paid resources from a privacy perspective. You have to dox yourself to Paypal, a bank, the publisher, or perhaps even all of them to gain access to paid articles. I think we should not require mandatory self-doxxing to implement EIPs. ",
