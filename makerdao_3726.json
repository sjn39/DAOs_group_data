A vault takes a specific base asset as deposit, which is then delegated to Strategies that farm and recycle rewards back into the specific base asset of the Vault in question. A more complex product is a Delegated Vault, which leverages a certain base asset to borrow another asset that is then delegated to a Vault. Yearn has previously been whitelisted for the following Maker Oracles:  ETH/USD BTC/USD YFI/USD  These vaults function in a similar way: The corresponding strategy of each vault takes the underlying asset (YFI, BTC, or ETH) and opens a Maker CDP with it as collateral to draw DAI against. This DAI is then delegated to the Yearn DAI Vault to earn income. The strategy relies on the next OSM price in order to effectively and securely manage its CDP position, performing rebalance and unwind operations as required. We are currently expanding our Maker-based strategy family to support four additional assets: UNI, LINK, AAVE, and COMP. The new strategies will operate in the same  manner as those powering our existing yWETH, yWBTC, and yYFI vaults. In order to manage the CDP positions in an efficient and risk minimized way, we wish to have access to the corresponding OSM prices. As before, we use  permissioned proxy contracts, in the event new strategies that require the OSM emerge. They are controlled by Yearn\u2019s Governance.
