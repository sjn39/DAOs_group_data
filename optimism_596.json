                    "content": "Hello, I was recently directed to the following page Notion \u2013 The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases. with a list of EIP4844 contributors which presumably will get a reward in OP for their work on EIP4844. I am very pleased that successful projects like Optimism are funding public goods and in particular core development. Not only with monetary funding but also with their own time and man-hours in research and implementation. I am also glad to be personally considered for this funding even if my participation in EIP4844 has been infinitesimal at most. I wish other projects, in particular those with their own tokens, do allocate a percentage of their token to fund core development and public goods in general. However, I believe that in this particular instance the approach taken by Optimism is not right for several reasons. Most, if not all of the people in that list, are core developers that already belong to a collective that is self curated and that distributes funding towards them, this is the Protocol Guild. I believe this is the right place to allocate funding for core development. Although it is understandable that Optimism may want to have a finer decision on how their funds are allocated among members, in this particular instance of a feature that has not even been shipped to Ethereum mainnet and whose date hasn\u2019t even been set on public testnets, I believe that this hurts Ethereum governance credibility of neutrality. It also may have impact among core dev teams themselves: should I be careful in the future deciding in which subprojects do I work within Prysm to expect a higher payout if I work on projects that are of interest to Optimism? (noting that this project in particular is of high interest to Prysm\u2019s mother company). Should I neglect forkchoice and allocate more of my time to EIP4844? On the other side of the same coin, the list itself fails to recognize participation of many people that do contribute under the hood. How about the devops on each team that helped setup and run special CI flows for the respective EIP4844 branches? How about project managers that are involved in facilitating some of these coredevs to take time from other resources to work on EIP4844?  I don\u2019t want to claim that I have any right to decide how Optimism allocates their funds, just noticing that the protocol guild has already gone through these questions in detail, in an ample forum of coredevs and has instructed guides on who and how much should be distributed from the funds it obtains, and often times, in order to see a feature live on mainnet, there are many more working directly and indirectly (even facilitating those that work directly) than those that receive credit for it. I also don\u2019t want to take credit off the people in that list: I have personally seen the work and the countless hours that some of my colleagues are putting into this, they are true champions. Having said so, and again repeating that I am very glad and honoured to be considered and quite happy to see such an influential project donating funds towards core development, I kindly request my name to be taken off that list.

While they weren\u2019t particularly involved in 4844 community calls they were involved in Nethermind networking and tx pool 4844 integrations and very detailed code review of whole 4844 changes. Not sure how the list was compiled, but it is not complete even on it\u2019s own terms. That being said, core devs focusing on withdrawals or other general improvements are not less aligned with 4844 and making it happen on mainnet and excluding them is an unfair treatment. And we have already a mechanism to include them through Protocol Guild. ",

Everyone on the Prysm team is working on keeping the lights on, and if Prysm doesn\u2019t keep the lights on, no upgrades happen. Similarly, some work is very high-profile by the nature of the role. Such work can certainly be instrumental in shipping an upgrade, but so is lower-profile work. For example, timelines would easily slip by 6 months if devops folks weren\u2019t around. Trying to capture the granularity of who and how an upgrade was shipped will create view-biased asymmetries and create perverse incentives around how people choose to structure their work in the future.

                    "content": "Thanks for the Feedback @potuz! This nomination for EIP-4844 contributors is for Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round 2, where Badgeholders will decide how much funding to allocate to it. Protocol Guild and a lot of client teams are also nominated. We only stepped in here because no one else nominated EIP-4844 contributions and we felt like it was important work that should be on the ballot. Initially we thought about nominating all the contributors on the list as individuals, but were afraid that asking Badgeholders (voters in RetroPGF2) to understand the granularity of each contribution would be a lot to ask. This is why we decided to put it out as a collection. While this collection was created by Protolambda, Liam and others from the OP Labs team, who were deeply involved in EIP-4844 work, I don\u2019t think anyone is claiming this collection is a perfect reflection of contributions. But I personally think it\u2019s better to have a decent collection of contributors that is nominated rather than no nomination at all. One possible solution for the future could be that anyone can create such a collection and different collections can reflect different views of understanding of the contributions. E.g. if you don\u2019t agree with this collection you could come along and create your own EIP-4844 collection that reflects your best understanding of the contributions. Curious to hear your thoughts on how we might solve this in the future! I think we can\u2019t ask Badgeholders to have the best understanding of how 100+ different people contributed to particular work. There needs to be some way for Badgeholders to outsource this curation to others. This could be self-curation (e.g. Protocol Guild) or curation by third parties (what we tried to do here). Open to any ideas on this! ",
