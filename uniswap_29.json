This way u will get a lot more followers buying from uni due to less fees and control the masses. Fees are killing us small timers ",

I bought  ethernity and it was only 2 coins and the rest was fees. So I can say I paid close to 100$ in fees. Is that fare for us smaller timers that keep supporting uni??? Give back so we know that we should stay with uni but instead it\u2019s going to push me away and purchase on other exchanges amd it going to push me away as a cliemt. ",
