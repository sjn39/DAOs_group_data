I had wondered why there were fixed numbers of MKR chosen for things (50000 MKR to ES) given the whole MKR burn financial reward structure which MKR outstanding by design was expected to change. It begged the question why 5% of outstanding wasn\u2019t the ES number required or some other variation vs. using a fixed number that would reflect a changing % of MKR owned over time. The basic question becomes two fold. Why are we using MKR to limit access to a function? Why is this amount a fixed number vs. some other function or number? I suggested % MKR outstanding others suggested $$ amount. I am leaving this here as a general forum stub topic for discussion on this as a general governance discussion topic Maker system parameters that use an amount of MKR existing somewhere or doing something as a system operations control variable.

                    "content": "Thanks for capturing this @MakerMan , the general argument for a fixed amount was that it is more practical than a dynamic number, it\u2019s more easily referenced and better understood as a threshold at which something (MIP, ES, IAM) may be implemented. This is a good topic to keep in mind as the ecosystem grows and the distribution of MKR holders change over time. As came up in the governance call, we should keep in mind,  burn/dilution rates, thresholds relative to supply and/or amount of MKR in Chief MKR token price to ensure security / skin in the game  ",
