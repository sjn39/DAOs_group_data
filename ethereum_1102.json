By having a smaller transaction type, individuals will pay lower gas fees - and the network as a whole can confirm more transaction in a block - thus preserving Inclusive Accountability.  As apart of EIP-1, any EIP should get feedback prior to sending a PR.  So here is my proposal:   github.com   TheRook/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-TODO.md --- eip: <to be assigned> title: Ditto Transactions author: Michael Brooks <m@ib.tc> discussions-to: <URL> status: Draft type: <Standards Track | Meta | Informational> category (*only required for Standard Track): <Core | Networking | Interface | ERC> created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format> requires (*optional): <EIP number(s)> replaces (*optional): <EIP number(s)> ---  ## Simple Summary A ditto transaction allows for a user to duplicate any previously confirmed transaction.  A transaction has multiple fields that maybe useful to re-use, which includes script code that makes up the smart contracts. A ditto, or copy of an existing transaction is the smallest form of a signed signature that can be used to convey value across the Ethereum network. A smaller transaction size reduces gas prices and frees up more confirmation bandwidth.  ## Abstract If some previous transaction shares simulators with a transaction a user is about to make, then fewer bytes of data are needed to represent this transaction to the blockchain. Because previously confirmed transaction are immutable and global, they can be referenced and reused.  ## Motivation     This file has been truncated. show original      ",
