After the Lido community voted against the previous plan of selling 10 million LDO tokens at a flat rate of $1.45 per coin to Dragonfly Capital, the new proposal was made with some changes in selling rates and adding 1 year lock-up vesting period, has now been approved by the community. The vote is half a treasury diversification plan for liquid staking Lido Finance. The entire plan involves liquidating 20 million LDO tokens for DAI. Lido plans to sell half of this sum to Dragonfly Capital. ",
