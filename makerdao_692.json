Will you abstain from voting initiatives driven by Growth? I understand the excitement here, and you are a great community member for sure, but I feel a sense of unease seeing CU members also become delegates. It all feels a bit incestuous and that there are potential issues for \u201ccontrol\u201d of the DAO. Tough to put my finger on it though I sense it could be an issue down the line. Imagine if Doo had the same number of MKR as El Pro and could essentially vote in what he (presumably Growth\u2019s proxy) wanted. Not saying this shouldn\u2019t go forward though we should be wary of this trend, if anything for the problem of a small group appearing to control or have outsized influence over the DAO. ",

On thing I like about the MIP process is that it gives everyone ample time to comment and give feedback on proposals before voting. I find that when concerns arise, many times a stronger solution can be crafted when collaborating with others\u2026even if we clearly have differences of opinions. ATM, I am not sure on how to respond to your comment on adding contributors given where we are in the governance cycle for the CES budget MIP. I hope you see by my and the CES team responses in the forum and Discord, we are open to feedback and provide lots of clarification when questions are asked. As a CU, we also spent some time in this sprint to talk about our communications strategy. One of our tactics was to open a more direct line of communication with the delegates since it\u2019s critical we have consistent dialog due to all of the challenges ahead of us. Scaling collateral especially with RWAs and having effective Collateral Operations is going to level up all of us. As a start, I\u2019ve asked Miguel to add you to our delegates Discord channel and I encourage any and all feedback you have for us whether in Discord or the public forums. Thanks. ",

Here was my reasoning and concern for initial No. I, like many other community members, agree that expanding Dai supply is important and collateral onboarding is crucial. The demand for RWA collateral is growing and unfortunately, the backlog for different types of collateral application is increasing as well. However, I was concerned about:   A lack of KPI in Dai supply impact. So the question of whether there is a range or goal on how much more Dai or collateral types this expansion will be able to bring?   Potential redundancy. Especially regarding Collateral Program Manager, how would the team make sure his/her role doesn\u2019t overlap with the Risk team\u2019s role?   Regarding #1, without specific goals with numbers, I couldn\u2019t assess the significant impact of this expansion. However, the DM helped to understand more about the effect in number terms and the assessment seemed fair. Regarding #2, After hearing the explanation, I agreed that it can help to coordinate with other Core Units rather than overlapping or competing. Once again, thank you for the quick response and also apology for my short reasoning, which might have come off as a bit rude. Will try to write in more details in the future. ",

The following point also made sense:    MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001)   Given the scale of the proposed budget increase (7x Q4 RWF cash burn), eight figures annually including the 3-month upfront contingency payment, we believe the DAO should receive more detail and substantiation. Additionally, the milestones the proposal implies are very ambitious and Governance should be confident the team can execute should the proposal pass. An Ambitious Budget Requires a Structured and Coherent Plan The attached budget suggests, at ~$250K per transaction, that 24 deals in the next twelve months will be achieved. However, the proposal focuses on locking in the commitment from the DAO without showing the corresponding plan and pipeline that would deliver these transactions.

The following part was different from other CUs but made sense.    MIP40c3-SP60: Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget   Note that a primary difference in our incentive model is that contributors retain the right to their MKR vesting even after leaving the Core Unit.

Then I became one. But there was no manual, so I made a lot of expensive mistakes.   After 1,000+ board meetings, I decided to write one.   Here\u2019s Good Director/Bad Director:   5:14 PM - 2 Apr 2022           2.3K                340            \"Good Director knows they only have two jobs:  Hire and compensate the right CEO. Approve the budget and strategic plan.  Bad Director thinks their main job is to provide good ideas. They think the board\u2019s job is to micro-manage the CEO.\" Which can be translated as onboard and compensate the right CUs and approve the budget and strategic plan. \"Good Director trusts the CEO completely until they don\u2019t. Once they don\u2019t, it is time to make a change. There\u2019s no in between. Bad Director constantly tests and scrutinizes the CEO, making them feel insecure in their role and always on the brink of being fired.\" I am probably guilty of it. Will try to be less scrutinizing. \"Good Director knows that management can only focus on 1-2 things at once. Bad Director forwards an article they read with the subject line: \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t We Doing THIS?!?!\u201d\" Come to think of it, I think many of us make this mistake to CUs. \"Good Director always remembers that they are a fiduciary of all shareholders. Bad Director looks at every decision as: \u201cWhat is in it for my firm/pocketbook?\u201d\" Very true that delegates should make decisions that ultimately support the Maker system and MKR holders. Just thought it was interesting how it helped me to reflect on some of my mistakes. ",

Ratification Poll for Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget, PE-001 (MIP40c3-SP68) - April 11, 2022 Voted No Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A -Of course, PE CU is a critical CU but at the same time, the Maker community needs to think about whether such budget increase is justified. If not, we will have all the CUs asking for a raise in budget and frame it as needed for the system to grow, and brand those who oppose as going against growing the ecosystem. However, there\u2019s diminishing marginal utility and the budget of the Maker protocol is limited. So is it justified? We see that the cost is largely driven by increase in additional hirings. The focus of the team being expanding on L2 and sidechains.    MIP40c3-SP68: Modify Protocol Engineering Core Unit Budget - (PE-001)   The biggest cost driver is due to the team choosing to increase headcount by 3, from 14 to 17.   I also have a high hope for Dai expansion in L2, sidechains, and other mainnets. However, the better question is without this increase, would there be significant opportunity cost to the Maker protocol. And at least from the forum post and discussion, I was unable to find such. Therefore, voting no for now. Ratification Poll for Add Data Insights Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP64) - April 11, 2022 Voted No Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A -While it was great to see different CUs expressing how they worked and got benefit from using Data Insights CU, the opportunity cost of not raising budget depends on a strong assumption. For example, the main argument was that the team wouldn\u2019t have enough resources to dedicate to RWA and L2 data. But RWA data is not something that changes very rapidly and for L2, it\u2019s still in infancy so believed that it makes more sense to actually have such expand further to see how the current resource is getting constrained.

Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP63) - April 11, 2022 Voted No Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A \u2013As mentioned above, I am still against COM CU\u2019s expansion to \u201cPublic Relations Support.\u201d My detailed reasoning can be found here: MIP40c3-SP63: Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 - #28 by Doo_Nam Ratification Poll for Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team - April 11, 2022 Voted Yes Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A \u2013For this one, I am giving benefit of doubt that this will improve collateral onboarding process. Ratification Poll for Modify the Collateral Application Form (MIP6c3-SP2) - April 11, 2022 Voted Yes Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A \u2013Many collateral applicants have expressed that it is difficult that onboarding process including questions and formats are keep changing. But for this one as well, I am giving benefit of doubt that this will improve collateral onboarding process. Ratification Poll for Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - April 11, 2022 Voted No Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A \u2013Dai events are indeed quite popular and many partners have asked for tickets, but even at the current form, the price is higher than usual requests and also this forces the Protocol to host such parties and maintain the team 365 days (via salaries). Therefore, still voting against it. My other reasoning can be found here: MIP39c2-SP32: Adding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - #51 by Doo_Nam Ratification Poll for Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) - April 11, 2022 Voted Abstain Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A -Was tempted to vote one way but then as it\u2019s RWA related that requires more extensive reviews. Decided to trust the judgement of the other MKR holders. Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) - April 11, 2022. Voted No Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A -It\u2019s a hefty millions dollar cost for uncertain benefit for the protocol. I was against DECO and posted several comments questioning and similarly against this \u201calternative\u201d as well. Ratification Poll for Update Data Insights Core Unit Mandate (MIP39c2-SP31) - April 11, 2022 Voted No Related Core Value: Pragmatic Conflict of Interest: N/A -Considering I am voting no to the budget, believed that requesting the team to increase the mandate while voting against the budget is effectively undermining the CU. Therefore, would prefer to see the CU perform under the current mandate and maybe expand mandate when the new budget request seems more reasonable. ",

While glad that the risk was mitigated, want to clarify that at least it seems like few delegates including I didn\u2019t get communication nor recommendation as suggested. Initially thought maybe it was due to my voting power being small (which is reasonable especially when the team is in hurry to pass the vote as soon as possible) but seems like several with large voting power also didn\u2019t get such. Therefore, maybe in the future such can be communicated more effectively to better secure the protocol. ",

Here\u2019s how we turned Airbnb around:   8:08 PM - 3 May 2022           5.4K                550            First few posts were interesting and even might be relevant for the Maker Protocol. \u201cFirst, we simplified our business. We got back to our roots, prioritizing the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences\u201d -For Maker, the root or the core use is of course its vaults and also stablecoin Dai. And especially in terms of vaults, it has been increasingly difficult to compete as the bear market has pressured the protocol to lower stability fee. However, are there ways to make vaults more competitive via other ways also accessible? These might be questions we have to wonder more. \u201cWe cut the vast majority of our projects, shuttered our business units, and made the painful decision to do a layoff\u201d -If it comes to such dire situation, it might be important to look at some of \u201cexperiments\u201d that the protocol has been doing but with not much return yet. \u201cWe significantly improved our cost structure, decreasing our cost of revenue (merchant fees and servers), and tightly managed our fixed costs\u201d -For Maker protocol, fixed cost has been overall rising and some such as company set ups or operations should be able to reviewed to be more efficient. \u201cNext, we changed our approach to marketing. When travel stopped, we paused all performance marketing and shifted our focus to PR (there have been 1M+ stories written about Airbnb since then)\u201d \u201cBy 2021, we started investing in brand marketing again, but reduced our overall marketing spend from 34% of our revenue in 2019 to 20% in 2021\u201d -This part is interesting because I think it ironically still shows the importance of marketing and PR. However, it is indeed important to focus on marketing and PR that is effective. \u201cIn 2021, we completely overhauled our product as the world became more flexible. We made 150+ upgrades and improvements, including launching the \u201cI\u2019m Flexible\u201d feature, which has been used more than 2 billion times\u201d -What would it mean for the Maker protocol to be more flexible in the first place? I believe the protocol has become more flexible both in approach and executions. For example, D3M is much more capital efficient but it wouldn\u2019t have passed or executed in the early phase of DAO. However, compared to many other protocols, Maker still is not so flexible in many ways (easy ways to have multiple collateral for one vault for example) and also quite expensive to use. ",

Ratification Poll for Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn to earn Yield (MIP92) - January 9, 2023 Voted No Conflict of Interest: N/A -Considering Yearn team itself is using only about 10% of available DAI cap for YFI token, we believe it\u2019s quite unfair deal for Maker especially considering their team will be taking 20% of fee. Maker is already deploying capital to AAVE and Compound so really, the strategy is more for Yearn to deploy to riskier protocols, which Maker shouldn\u2019t have exposure to.  image790\u00d796 3.75 KB  Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 Voted Approve only the Abstain Modifier Conflict of Interest: Delegate ourselves -We believe both polls and executive votes are important and therefore, feel like weighting more for executive votes can create incentive for delegates to focus less on polls. In terms of abstain factor, considering it will be set reasonably high, it shouldn\u2019t impact most delegates unless they are actively abstaining. ",

It\u2019s true that there\u2019s risk increasing regarding Gemini and its related products. However, it also have been generating revenue for the protocol. By the nature of PSM, we understand that even if the community ends up voting it to debt ceiling of 0, it won\u2019t reduce GUSD exposure to 0 overnight. It just means that no more GUSD can be converted to Dai. And that slowly Dai will be converted to GUSD to reduce the PSM amount. Therefore, in practice, putting it into 0 or even 100 won\u2019t make a difference in critical time. Therefore, we have voted to maintain the current ceiling to lean toward the protocol continue to have the revenue.

I would describe myself as a first-principles thinker and investor with a decade+ time horizon on the Defi and crypto space. I currently lead Strategy at Flashbots and collaborate on research with Paradigm. I co-host the Uncommon Core podcast with Su Zhu. I\u2019m a long-term MKR holder and supporter of MakerDAO and have been thinking and writing about the project for years   My values and initiatives  Solving MakerDAO\u2019s principal-agent problem Organizations in general, but especially more flat ones like MakerDAO, tend to suffer from the principal-agent problem. Specifically, Maker\u2019s workforce (the CUs) are agents who work on behalf of their principals (the MKR holders). However, in the absence of managerial oversight, these agents don\u2019t share the same interests as their principals, and the principals have neither the necessary information nor incentives to intervene. For a good read on the topic, especially regarding DAOs, I recommend Prof. Andy Hall\u2019s post. In the context of MakerDAO, this principal-agent problem materializes as follows:  CUs get to make their own budgets and set their own roadmaps without proper oversight; there is very little accountability to MKR holders, and offboarding CUs or even individual facilitators has been a struggle MKR holders are supposed to make very complex decisions they are neither equipped nor financially incentivized to make; as a result, CUs get virtually free reign over the protocol, and no one sets a high-level strategic roadmap for Maker as a whole  To combat these problems, MakerDAO has created the delegate system. While the existing delegate system makes some steps in the right direction (e.g., ability to delegate MKR at all), it fails at what is arguably the most critical piece: to address the principal-agent problem and align the incentives between MKR holders and their delegates. Today,  delegates get paid by the DAO based on vanity metrics (e.g. vote participation) not the quality of their decisions. The latter would require delegates to divide labor amongst themselves and become domain experts focused on a small part of the DAO (e.g., financials, marketing, RWA, operations, workforce, etc.) The potential salary for delegates is much too small to attract the talent we need in these key decision-making roles.  Hence I propose to create a system of executive delegates (or super delegates) who, on behalf of MKR holders, are in charge of  steering the DAO in the long-term and setting a coherent vision holding CUs accountable to MKR holders  These executive delegates would work for Maker full-time and are properly aligned with executive-level compensation and MKR grants/options. They are not necessarily the same as today\u2019s delegates and can be voted in, e.g., on one-year terms and voted out anytime. It is impressive what Maker has achieved as a headless organization, but we are hitting the scaling limit of this approach. It is time to create an incentive system that will attract the best strategy and leadership talent in the industry to steer Maker for the long term.  Toward data-driven decision making One of the most important yet underrated and underexplored aspects of DAO governance is managing the treasury. Any DAO can be seen as a resource allocation problem yet decision-makers lack the right framework to even think about the problem, let alone the information to make good decisions. For example,  How much capital buffer do we need? Which CUs are profitable vs. unprofitable for the DAO? Should we burn MKR, print MKR, or do nothing at all? How much should we value future profits vs. profits we can make today? Should we raise a strategic investment round, and if yes, at what terms? Should we raise money in a fixed-rate debt offering? Should we use incentives to grow, and if yes, where?  In absence of a strong framework for treasury management, we are left to defer to our gut feeling, and we have not been doing a good job at it. As a starting point for discussion, @monetsupply and I have created such a framework for treasury management in Defi. In essence, we propose to run Maker with the goal of maximizing MKR holder value and putting each dollar of revenue to its best possible use. Applied to MakerDAO, our framework suggests we should  never rely on equity offerings to cover capital shortfalls (as we did in March 2020) but instead build a much bigger surplus buffer, minimum 5-10% of all DAI outstanding suspend all buybacks and dividend payments for the foreseeable future heavily invest in future growth, possibly by doing a debt offering explore the option of a strategic sale to incentive key ecosystem or growth partners  Of course, our framework is all but complete and many of the above questions need constant evaluation by trained professionals. To this end, I want to encourage the creation of a treasury CU that becomes the \u201cfinancial brain\u201d of MakerDAO and creates data-driven recommendations to executive delegates and other key decision-makers. I have since learned about the new Strategic Finance CU and from early conversations and evaluating their existing work, it seems that they could possibly play this role going forward.  Conflicts of Interest  I don\u2019t have any investments or incentives that should impact my role as a delegate at the current time. MKR is one of my biggest holdings. I consider myself very strongly aligned with the long-term success of the project I have also read, and agree with, the Recognised Delegate Code of Conduct.  ",

There has been a persistent meme that Maker is unprofitable over the last weeks and needs to cut expenses and block CU budgets. That is (1) not true, we are on track to earn $50m over the next 12months, and (2) even if Maker were unprofitable, that would be totally normal at this stage of our growth trajectory. Yes, our capital buffer is too low, but we finally have to separate this from our operating budget. Our capital buffer should be deeply positive, and our operating budget deeply negative, with the delta coming from debt and token issuance. I believe this is the goldilocks zone for Maker. So Maker should be spending more money, not less. Marketing should be among the largest costs in any growth startup, if not the largest. Maker is currently spending almost nothing on marketing. That needs to change. Maker customers (both borrowers and savers) are very sticky, warranting us to spend money on their initial acquisition.  ",

Specifics aside, this is the key fundamental mismatch between MakerDAO and deals of this ilk. Huge up-front cost, minimal potential for scaled deployment. I wish this sentiment were more widespread and something I tried to point to in North Star - DAI as the Destination. ",

I confirm @hasu\u2019s opinion that single deals tend to be time consuming, complex and non-repetitive. I further agree with @teej\u2019s proposition on how Maker can best scale. Both opinions simply make sense. ",
