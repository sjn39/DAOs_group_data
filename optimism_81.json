                    "content": "Hi Optimism Community. On behalf of Wintermute I wanted to explain the recent events surrounding wallet 0x4f3a120E72C76c22ae802D129F599BFDbc31cb81. I\u2019ll aim to be as factual as possible, focusing on full transparency and making sure every Optimism stakeholder is on the same page with the current situation as well as making it clear what our actions are going forward. Timeline of events Two weeks ago, Wintermute was engaged by the Optimism Foundation to provide liquidity in the OP token upon its listing on centralized exchanges. As part of the agreement Wintermute received a 20 million loan in OP. Initially the loan was to be deployed on one of the Wintermute\u2019s wallets on Optimism. As we communicated the wallet address to the Optimism team, we made a serious error. We had a Gnosis safe deployed on mainnet for a while and due to an internal mistake, we\u2019ve communicated the very same wallet as the receiving address. As some of you may know, this is not a smart thing to do - having control over mainnet Safe doesn\u2019t guarantee control on other EVM compatible chains (unlike ordinary wallets). We notified the Optimism team on the 30th of May. Since the launch next day was a clear priority we agreed on receiving additional 20 million tokens (providing $50 million USDC as collateral), all while exploring ways to retrieve the funds. At the same time we got in contact with the Gnosis Safe team, asking them for assistance with retrieving the funds. After consulting with the Optimism and Safe teams, Wintermute made the assessment that the funds were potentially retrievable, and that nobody other than Wintermute could recover those funds. The assessment was also that it was a high risk retrieval that could only be attempted once and required Safe to support. Retrieval was scheduled for 7th of June. However, the assumption that the funds can only be recoverable by Wintermute proved to be false. Exploit Somebody has done their homework well, however. In less than 24 hours after we notified Safe and Optimism about the situation, wallet 0x8BcFe4f1358E50A1db10025D731C8b3b17f04DBB has been funded via tornado cash transfer. It proceeded with performing a replay attack by replaying the Gnosis Safe MasterCopy 1.1.1 deployment from Eth mainnet. They then used the previously deployed contract 0xE7145dd6287AE53326347f3A6694fCf2954bcD8A to deploy vaults per batches of 162. The hacker then proceeded with selling 1m OP tokens for ETH and withdrew back to L1 via Synapse and Hop bridges to then use tornado cash on mainnet. What we are planning to do about it As of the time of this writing, the attacker still has 19 million OP tokens in their possession. We are not sure why they chose not to liquidate all of it at once. There is hope that it is a whitehat exploit, in which case the remaining funds are potentially recoverable. However we are currently operating under the premise that it is not the case, since we haven\u2019t received any communication from them and our message on the chain was left unanswered. We want to make one thing clear - the initial error is 100% Wintermute\u2019s fault and as such we will proceed to buy OP every time the attacker sells it to make the protocol whole eventually (we did initiate buying the first million OP tokens yesterday already). We understand that it can potentially create price volatility in the token and will make best efforts to smoothen the effect. Message to the exploiter We expect the exploiter to read this as well (eventually). This is our message to you: We are open to see this as a white hat exploit. Moreover, the way the attack has been performed has been rather impressive and we can even consider consulting opportunities or other forms of cooperation in future. We are also content with the scenario where the remaining 19 million tokens are returned to Optimism wallet: 0x2501c477d0a35545a387aa4a3eee4292a9a8b3f0 You have one week to consider being a whitehat. In case the above doesn\u2019t happen, we are 100% committed to returning all the funds, tracking the person(s) responsible for the exploit, fully doxxing them and delivering them to the corresponding juridical system. Remember that robbers need to get lucky every time. Cops only have to get lucky once. This is not a \u201ccode is law\u201d theoretical argument. This is you taking a bag with cash that was left behind by a (careless) person. Us being careless still leaves you a criminal. We already started investigating the potential leads, in certain cases stopping short of informing respective law enforcement agencies. Consider your options and choose to be good and optimistic instead of living in fear  ",

As the community is very disappointed in the teams and how things were handled up to this point.  Market makers dumping the price in order to buy back ( the reality of what  is happening so far) is not a great thing for a project. Optimism was a great concept and we had high hopes for this; the community have now lost the trust.  Now there will be plenty of guys from both teams coming here and slamming this message saying this and that. Go for it! - Reality is the teams should have been transparent before this! They should have communicated this within 48 hrs max. Those who knew already cashed out of the air drop and now talking about getting the next one. unbelievable ! Keep in mind the market makers are not here on goodwill. They will make their money one way or another. This is just wrong on so many levels. ",

Even after the exploit happened, Optimism team hid this information for additional 2 days while insiders sold OP tokens and caused 40% dump. I want the community to continue investigation and urge Optimism team to clarify. (1) Why did it take 2 additional days after the exploit on June 6th to disclose the information? (2) Was there insiders who, based on information about the exploit not yet available to the public, sold OP tokens before the public announcement on June 8th? Please find the details in the following post:     Information Disclosure Request for 20M OP Exploit - Was There Insider Trading? What Happened Behind The Scenes?       I collected relevant public available information in retrospective and worked out a timeline of the exploit. From these information combined with OP token price history, I strongly suspect there was insider trading. Insiders were aware of the exploit 2 days earlier than public disclosure.

We\u2019re all early and best practices are still developing. If it\u2019s true that you confirmed two smaller, test transactions before the main one, it suggests an obvious best practice. Always go thru the process of spending / withdrawing assets before greenlighting a major transaction. In this case, that would\u2019ve exposed the issue with much less value at stake. Verifying a test transaction by just viewing it in a block explorer / seeing the account balance go up is insufficient. ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone, wanted to give an update on the ongoing situation and also provide a response to some common questions/reactions I\u2019ve seen last 24 hours. Update on current situation Exploiter is currently in possession of 18 million OP tokens out of 20 he had initially. We\u2019ve repurchased 1 million tokens to offset what they sold. 1 Million OP tokens has been sent to Vitalik and he has been kind enough to return them to Optimism Foundation. Some tokens have been delegated by the exploiter, but I don\u2019t see this as a material issue at this stage. Clarifying some questions Optimism should have done a better job at checking the transactions to Wintermute. I\u2019d like to reiterate again that this was 100% our fault. Could Optimism have asked us to perform that check? Yes they could in theory. In practice nobody asks for this ever, including when dealing with large transfers. Protocol is always: Do a test Wait for confirmation the test was successful Send the rest Our process failed there, but it is excessive to ask the Optimism team to do more in this situation. However, it is certainly a learning point for all of us to potentially do these checks in future where the magnitude of the transfer warrants it. Can you prove that Wintermute bought 1 million tokens? If OP token has only been available on decentralized exchanges, such proof would have been easy to provide. However, in our capacity as Market Maker, we are trading OP on 5 major centralized exchanges and some smaller ones as well. I am very open to suggestions on how we can demonstrate this, but ultimately , short of doing an independent audit on Wintermute, there is no way for us to prove this. I can say one thing though. If we endeavor to buy all 20 million tokens right away, we would push the price higher and open ourselves for a possibility of other trading firms front running us. Moreover, we would give the attacker a possibility to cash out at a better price. Current approach where we only buy what the exploiter sells, makes sure that the price impact over the space of more than a few hours is minimal. Why didn\u2019t we ask for a network upgrade to fix the mistake This is a two-part question. First opportunity to do this was when we realized that the funds were inaccessible. As I\u2019ve written in the original post, the initial assessment has been that the funds can only be recovered by us. Safe team recently posted their own assessment, confirming that:  1258\u00d7148 29.4 KB  Back then it seemed feasible that given the possibility of recovery it would make sense to proceed without network upgrade and recover funds later. Second opportunity arose once we realized that the funds had been taken by the exploiter. I\u2019ve seen questions and even governance proposals to fix this by voting. I strongly believe that \u201cfixing\u201d this by governance vote would have been a mistake, despite potentially saving Wintermute money. What this would have created is a precedent. Precedent to compensate every single mistake on Optimism in future, that would not stop with transfers gone bad. At Wintermute we strongly believe that this is not the right approach, not just for Optimism, but for all other protocols as well, save for catastrofic events endangering protocol survival. Accepting to recover funds this way would mean that we would have no right to oppose similar actions done in future. It might sound illogical, but this is the way we approach governance \u2013 by broadcasting our values and operating principles and striving to abide by them. If our opinion on this matter changes we would communicate it. We don\u2019t think that our values should change based on an amount that we can afford to lose. I\u2019m well aware that the majority of trading firms do not operate this way and would simply vote in line with their commercial interests. We are different. Why can\u2019t we make an offer to the attacker to purchase the remaining OP for USDC? There is a simple legal reason \u2013 this would constitute an OTC trade and we are required to KYC our counterparties (to make sure we are not dealing with North Korea or a drug kingpin). There is also a fairness reason \u2013 we don\u2019t think the exploiter should get away with it. We would be legalizing his exploit that way and we don\u2019t think that makes sense. Message to the exploiter I realize, I was not necessarily clear what we consider fair in this situation. We are prepared to accept to pay a bounty of 10% of the total amount (so in this case an extra 1 million OP tokens on top of what was already cashed out) and consider this a whitehat hack situation and not to pursue you legally. Remaining 17 million tokens should be returned back to Optimism Foundation at the address: 0x2501c477d0a35545a387aa4a3eee4292a9a8b3f0 If the funds are not transferred by 12PM noon 11th of June, we\u2019ll start sharing the information we already know with the relevant authorities and will not treat this as whitehat. We will duplicate this message, broadcasting it to  0x4f3a120E72C76c22ae802D129F599BFDbc31cb81 on optimism network ",

                    "content": "Hi everyone, We want to provide context and clarify our intentions behind actions taken following the Phase 0 airdrop.  Background As a major project on Optimism, Perpetual Protocol applied for and received a Phase 0 OP Token grant of 9m OP tokens. The proposal outlined 3 areas for spending: Liquidity Acquisition, Liquidity Mining and Builder Acquisition. Two aspects of the execution of the proposal have drawn criticism from the Optimism community. To better understand how decisions are made at Perpetual Protocol, it is key to know how the project is structured. As with most projects in the space, the ultimate goal is to decentralize and Perpetual Protocol shares this ideal. We currently have 5 distinct entities which are:   Perpetual DAO: the entity that holds and manages all remaining PERP tokens from the initial mint  Foundation: the team that builds the core protocol, manages the current UI found at perp.com, and manages rewards etc. as mandated by the Perpetual DAO  GrantsDAO: a sub DAO that funds projects and protocols to integrate and build on Perp  Token listing DAO: a sub DAO that approves and lists markets on Perp  Market Making Entity: a separate entity and team that handles market making  All of the entities currently have distinct teams, budgets and mandates, with the exception of the Perpetual DAO which does not yet have a team.  Issue 1: Retroactive airdrop to LPs As part of the initial Phase 0 proposal, we specified that we wanted to allocate 8M of OP tokens towards liquidity mining incentives to grow the TVL and trading volume on Perp. As part of this, we had also intended to reward existing LPs through a retroactive airdrop. This was not put into the proposal as we did not want to attract airdrop farmers but rather incentivise real individuals and entities that would provide funds to Perp. We did not provide sufficient details regarding our implementation plans and we should have communicated our plan better to the OP community. Wallets belonging to the market making entity (MME) were not excluded from the retroactive airdrop to all wallets that facilitated trading volume as an LP between launch and June 1, of which MME wallets comprised a substantial majority. The MME was formed as a distinct legal entity with its own team (detailed in this gov post: https://gov.perp.fi/t/proposal-market-making-entity/634/). \u200bThe MME uses the wallets listed in Perp V2 Foundation vs External, some of which were migrated from the Foundation (source). The MME mandate is two fold:  Provide liquidity on Perp V2, and Work with other market makers to provide liquidity on Perp V2 via USDC lending or other means  After the retroactive airdrop was sent to historical LPs of Perp v2, because the OP token has not yet been added as a collateral type on Perp v2, the MME decided to convert a portion of the OP to USDC (one of three assets currently used as collateral) in order to provide more liquidity on Perp v2. OP was not sold to profit team members, but to further the MME mandate of driving liquidity growth on Perpetual Protocol, and by extension, Optimism as a whole. We understand that to many people it may look like the foundation and MME are one organization, and as such, presume the foundation team gave tokens to itself, and later sold them. We would like to apologize for poorly communicating this matter to the OP community. We have asked the MME to repurchase the OP tokens that were sold, and place these in the fund used for future liquidity mining rewards as described in the Phase 0 proposal. Previously we planned to add OP as a collateral type once price discovery had matured and major distributions had been completed. We have decided to expedite this process, allowing the MME team to use OP as collateral in the near future, adding to the OP token\u2019s use cases.  Issue 2: GrantsDAO Allocation The sale of 500k OP tokens for USDC and subsequent bridging to Mainnet executed by the Perp GrantsDAO also caused concern and dismay among the Optimism community. The GrantsDAO is the longest running Perp sub-DAO. The GrantsDAO Committee is independent and no current or former foundation team members sit on this committee. This DAO has funded numerous Perp related projects and aims to continue doing so for years to come. According to the GrandDAO\u2019s experience, a large majority of grants are priced in USD as most of the projects still have expenses that are required to be paid in USD. Given this, the DAO committee\u2019s mandate demands effective treasury management, and the committee decided the best course of action was to sell the 500K OP for USDC. Afterwards the funds were bridged back to Ethereum and into the Gnosis safe where GrantsDAO funds are kept. The committee has expressed its understanding that bridging liquidity out of Optimism goes against the mission of the GrantsDAO (to grow the Perp and Optimism ecosystems) and this was an oversight on their part. We have asked the committee to create a new Gnosis safe on Optimism at the earliest possible time and bridge funds back so they are ready to distribute to grantees on Optimism.  Restatement of Intentions The Phase 0 airdrop proposal\u2019s stated goal is to increase the use of Perpetual Protocol as well as Optimism. We firmly believe the actions of the foundation team and sub-DAOs are aligned with this goal, as our future is directly tied to the future of Optimism as a whole. However, we understand how the actions described above led to misunderstanding about our intentions.  Perpetual\u2019s Future with Optimism Despite recent misunderstandings, our commitment to Optimism, the community and ecosystem has never been stronger.  We continue to have the highest transaction volume on Optimism (Dune) and work constantly to grow this number. We remain dedicated to being on Optimism only and have no plans to deploy on other chains. We are not multi-chain and the success of our protocol ties directly to the success of Optimism. Given we are not multi-chain, all PERP and OP used as rewards serve to grow and incentivise liquidity, users and builders on Optimism. We have a heavy focus on composability and have a solid track record of funding projects through grants. Working closely with the OP team we have convinced many projects to deploy on Optimism and continue to collectively grow the ecosystem. We are active in Optimism governance and are firmly committed to the future success of Optimism as well as a healthy, decentralized governance landscape.  We hope this gives some context into how the various teams thought about the actions they took and hope to illustrate that none of these had the intention to be malicious or self-serving. We have strongly backed Optimism as the chain to be on and will continue to do so. We strongly believe in the OP team and the potential of the ecosystem to thrive and create a composable DeFi world that benefits all. ",

I am not following Perp closely so correct me if I am wrong but do you discuss such changes with team and community, not with OP community but at least with your community ? As when this happened no one aware of this. Self-delegation and now this, in both the cases someone else pointed it out and then we get a official communication from your team. It should be other way around. ",

There are a number of actions that perpetual (and subsequent daos) took either outside the proposal or against the spirit of the proposal and it appears to me you are taking the proper steps to correct these based on the discussion happening in the forums.  I am glad you are doing this and think it\u2019s the right move.  I think we may consider some process to enforce the agreed upon proposals if the protocol asking for the funds acts in bad faith. I don\u2019t think perpetual did this however optimism was forced to trust you to do the right thing.  I understand the reading behind the retroactive airdrop and the reasoning makes sense however that decision shouldn\u2019t really have been up to you as you were asking for $op under specific qualifications and choosing to spend the $op differently then outlined isn\u2019t the way we want protocols to act even if for good reasons.
