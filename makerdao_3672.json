Wouldn\u2019t the price feed still be equally useful to MakerDAO (though maybe not some other projects) and cost far less? ",

(Or an hour before, queueing it up for the OSM.) It\u2019s definitely a very interesting model. But the consequences need to be thought through very carefully, especially if Maker wants to have a viable business model for its oracles. ",

I was using it as an easy filter to identify those vault classes that obviously lose money. The biggest problem isn\u2019t 200k or whatever it costs to provide an Oracle. The main problem is that means Maker is actually paying to assume the risk of bad debt within those vault classes. The last thing we need in the middle of a crash is for millions in debt to go bad that we were actively paying to hold onto. Our business is to be paid to hold risk not to do the opposite. I\u2019m leery of asking for major overhauls of the Oracle feeds, given that exploitation of oracles is a major vector of attack and any time you change something significantly, there\u2019s the chance you let someone in ",
