Having a strong group of MIP editors is crucial to the health of the MIPs process and the smooth progression and growth of the Maker Protocol. My desire has always been to serve MakerDAO impactfully, helping in its path towards greater and greater succcess. One important building block towards that success is having responsible and competent individuals in mandated roles, such as this one. Since the launch of the MIPs framework, Charles St. Louis has been the sole MIP-Editor, and I think it\u2019s time for one more. I am a good fit for this role for a number of reasons;  I am a long-time community member, being at MakerDAO for four years, being employed by the Maker Foundation for two and a half of those years, and planning to transition back into the community as the Foundation fulfulls its goal of dissolution. I have a well-rounded understanding of how the Protocol works, how governance works, how the MIPs framework works, and a great eye for quality and detail. In my role at the Community Development Department in the Foundation I\u2019ve regularly practiced all of the skills required by the MIP-Editor role. These include regular usage of git and GitHub, giving thoughtful and important feedback, performing follow-ups with project leads, communicating updates and notices, information maintenance, and more. I have good relationships with all of the mandated actors, and a good understanding of the emerging organizational structure here at MakerDAO.   Lastly, I would like to note that the expectation is that more MIP-Editors would come on board to help decentralize the task and role. I hope to come on as one of the MIP-editors, and intend to contribute to efforts outside of this role as well. In particular, I am involved with the Community Development team, Governance Communications team, and the Governance Domain Team.
