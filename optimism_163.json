With respect to \u201cTreasury Appropriations\u201d , we have two statement in current OPerating manual.  Here its clear that any proposal related to change must be submitted by an OP holder or their delegate.   image1276\u00d7465 47.8 KB   On the same page, we have this line stating that it will be initiated by OP Foundation.   image1071\u00d7520 36.6 KB  I assume and it has been confirmed that OP Foundation also hold some token and hence, they can submit a proposal. Important to note is that, such proposal will come from only from them or to put this in different word, I cant submit such proposal even if I hold OP token. What I am suggesting:- instead of this \u201cProposals to be initiated by the Foundation\u201d, we should change it to \"Proposals must be initiated by the Foundation* \"  Optimism Foundation hold few OP token which give them rights to submit such proposal. (of course word can be changed and paraphrased to give a clear message).  My reasoning:- All though small change, its important to be precise as we look up to OPerating manual when in doubt and it acts as a pillar towards holding the constitutions. Also, this is not just me, there is a another proposal (on different topic) and the author was pointing to this statement, I did try to explain but if manual is not clear, we cant have proper discussion.

                    "content": "This document describes the current governance proposal process of the Optimism Collective. It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The authoritative version is maintained here on the Optimism Foundation Github.  OPerating Manual v0.1.2:  The Token House and OP Holders  Governance in the Optimism Collective begins with the launch of the Token House and its members, the OP holders. As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals. In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote their OP directly, or delegate their OP voting power to an eligible third party. The Token House is just the first part of the Optimism Collective governance structure. Launch of the Citizens\u2019 House will soon follow and this OPerating Manual will be updated accordingly.  Governance Toolkit  The two primary tools for Optimism Collective governance are:   Snapshot: Where all Token House governance proposals are submitted for vote.  The Optimism Forum: A platform for discussion and deliberation about governance proposals.   Proposal Process \u2013 Components of a Valid Proposal  The lifecycle of a Token House governance proposal involves four phases:  (1) feedback; (2) submission; (3) voting; and (4) implementation. Each phase, and its associated requirements, are described below. 1 . Feedback Anyone submitting a proposal should make an effort to gather feedback from the community and from Delegates prior to submitting a proposal for vote. There are two primary avenues for feedback: (a) For lightweight or early feedback, authors may post a proposal (or an abbreviated version of your proposal) in the #gov-temp-check channel on Discord. This channel is open to the entire Optimism community and can be used as an easy way to get a quick temperature check. (b) For formal feedback from governance participants, authors may post a proposal in the Forum with a [DRAFT] label in the title. This signals your proposal is ready for feedback from Token House delegates. All feedback from these two forums is non-binding, but proposers are expected to engage in good faith. This step is designed to help craft thoughtful, effective proposals. After incorporating feedback, the proposal author may remove [DRAFT] from the proposal title and advance to proposal submission. 2 . Submission To be eligible for voting, a Token House governance proposal must be formally submitted by an OP holder or their delegate. This means that the proposal must be:   A valid Proposal Type. All v0.1 governance proposals must fall within one of the following categories:  Governance Fund (Phase 0 or Phase 1) Protocol Upgrade Inflation Adjustment Director Removal Treasury Appropriations Rights Protections    For a more detailed description of each Proposal Type, see \u201cProposal Process \u2013 By Proposal Type\u201d below.   Properly formatted to the applicable template. Each Proposal Type will have a specific Template associated with it in the Forum. Prior to submission, a proposal author must conform their proposal to the format of the applicable Template in all material respects. This will include, for the time being, a requirement that all submissions be made in English.  Approved by at least one delegate. Over the course of discussion and feedback, at least one Delegate with more than 0.0005% of voting power must signal that they believe the proposal is ready for vote. In the spirit of governance minimization, this document will not codify an explicit approval mechanism but will expect community members to interpret this appropriately.  Formally submitted to voting. One week before the start of each voting cycle, the Foundation will start a Voting Period Submission thread on the Forum. To formally submit a proposal for voting, the proposal author must either (a) update their proposal title to start with [READY] or (b) add a link to this Voting Period Submission thread that points to their proposal on the Forum. At the start of the next Voting Period, the Optimism Foundation will submit all valid proposals marked as ready to Snapshot for voting.  Submitted proposals must satisfy all the above criteria to be considered valid. Invalid proposals will be thrown out. Anyone submitting a proposal is welcome to submit a draft version of the proposal for feedback on the Optimism Forum. To do so, please include [Draft] in your Forum title, then update the proposal title once the proposal body is finalized. 3 . Voting To minimize overhead, all votes are conducted on Snapshot at regular intervals called voting periods. Voting periods begin each Thursday at 7pm GMT and end 1 week and 6 days later, on the following Wednesday at 7pm GMT. Proposal types may require one or more voting periods before a resolution to the vote can be reached. A Token House governance proposal will only be approved if it satisfies the following minimum vote thresholds:   Quorum: The minimum number of total OP votes required to be cast in connection with a proposal. Here, a quorum is measured as a % of the total votable OP supply.  The total votable OP supply will be determined based on a reasonable estimate provided by the Optimism Foundation prior to each voting period.    Approval threshold:  The minimum number of OP votes required to be cast in favor of approving a proposal. The approval threshold for each proposal is measured as % of votes cast to approve relative to the total number of votes cast in connection with a proposal.  A snapshot to determine voting power for each delegate or OP holder will be taken at the commencement of a given voting period. Depending on the Proposal Type, exact quorum and approval threshold requirements may vary. 4 . Implementation Proposals that are rejected due to invalidity or insufficient support can be resubmitted. Approved proposals are routed to the Optimism Foundation for implementation, as more fully described in the \u201cImplementation and Administration\u201d section below.  Proposal Process \u2013 Lifecycle  While the details of a particular Token House governance proposal may vary by Proposal Type, a proposal\u2019s lifecycle will generally look something like this:  Screen Shot 2022-06-07 at 6.07.45 PM2398\u00d7602 224 KB   Proposal Process  \u2013 By Proposal Type  The different requirements for submission and approval of each Proposal Type are summarized below.     Proposal Type Description Submission Requirements Vote Duration (# of voting periods) Quorum (minimum % of votable OP supply actually voted) Approval Threshold(minimum % of votes cast to approve relative to total votes cast)     Governance Fund  (Phase 0 Batch) OP distributions to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. Phase 0 specifically rewards existing projects that drove growth to Optimism before Airdrop #1  Eligibility requirements described here.   The Optimism Foundation will assist eligible Phase 0 candidates to structure submissions. Snapshot proposal for batch to be initiated by the Foundation. 1 (~2 weeks) 10% 51%   Governance Fund  (Phase 1) OP distributions to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. Phase 1 begins after Airdrop #1  Forum + Snapshot 1 (~2 weeks) 10% 51%   Protocol Upgrade Scheduled changes to the on-chain smart contracts comprising the mainnet Optimism protocol Snapshot 2 (~4 weeks) 10% 51%   Inflation Adjustment Changes to the inflation rate of newly minted OP (currently capped at 2% annually) Snapshot 2 (~4 weeks) 10% 76%   Director Removal Removal of a director of the Optimism Foundation Snapshot 2 (~4 weeks) 10% 76%   Treasury  Appropriations The amount of OP the Optimism Foundation may spend or distribute annually, beginning in Year 2 of its existence (the Year 1 budget is 30% of the initial total OP supply) Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation 2 (~4 weeks) 10% 51%   Rights Protections OP holders must consent to any changes to the founding documents of the Optimism Foundation, if those changes would materially reduce their rights Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation 2 (~4 weeks) 10% 51%     Implementation and Administration  In all cases, Optimism Collective governance is intended to be carried out consistent with the terms of its Working Constitution, the spirit of its Code of Conduct, and the pursuit of its Optimistic Vision. The Optimism Foundation will steward this process as described below. Administration The Optimism Foundation will facilitate the administration of the governance procedures described in this OPerating Manual with the aim of ensuring that OP holders may participate thoughtfully in Token House governance. Such administrative services may include:  Moderation of governance proposals to ensure they are validly submitted and voted upon; Removal of proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate or inconsistent with the values of the Collective; Monitoring of votes, the votable token supply, and voting periods for purposes of determining whether quorums and approval thresholds are met; Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted simultaneously or in close proximity to one another; Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release rollbacks (with or without a governance vote); and Such other things as the Foundation deems appropriate in connection with the above.  Implementation Approved Token House governance proposals will be routed to the Optimism Foundation for implementation. Upon receipt of an approved proposal, the Optimism Foundation will determine whether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the purposes of the Foundation and the Collective, and capable of being implemented in a legally compliant manner.  If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner to cause the proposal to be implemented. If it is not, the Foundation may remove the proposal for resubmission or cause the proposal to be implemented with certain guardrails, in its discretion, and coupled with an explanation to the Collective as to why the proposal was rejected or limited.  The Optimism Foundation will undertake this ministerial work with a view towards increasingly decentralizing its role over time.  Amendments  The procedures described in this OPerating Manual will go into effect at the time of Airdrop #1, and be adjusted later in connection with a series of governance experiments. These changes include but are not limited to introducing the Citizens\u2019 House, and adding, removing, and modifying Proposal Types and rules relating to voting processes. Any non-clerical updates to the OPerating Manual will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect. ",

Este documento describe el proceso actual de propuesta de gobernanza de Optimism Collective. Evolucionar\u00e1, con el Colectivo, con el tiempo.  Manual de operaciones v0.1: Token House y OP Holders La gobernanza en Optimism Collective comienza con el lanzamiento de Token House y sus miembros, los OP holders. Como miembros de Token House, los OP holders son responsables de presentar, deliberar y votar sobre varios tipos de propuestas en la gobernanza de Optimism Collective. Al llevar a cabo estas funciones, los OP holders pueden votar con OP directamente o delegar su poder de voto de OP a un tercero elegible. Token House es solo la primera parte de la estructura de gobierno de Optimism Collective. Pr\u00f3ximamente se inaugurar\u00e1 la C\u00e1mara de los Ciudadanos y este Manual Operativo se actualizar\u00e1 en consecuencia.  Kit de herramientas de gobernanza Las dos herramientas principales para la gobernanza de Optimism Collective son:  Snapshot: donde todas las propuestas de gobernanza de Token House se env\u00edan para votaci\u00f3n.  El foro del optimismo: Una plataforma de discusi\u00f3n y deliberaci\u00f3n sobre propuestas de gobernanza.   Proceso de propuesta: componentes de una propuesta v\u00e1lida El ciclo de vida de una propuesta de gobernanza de Token House consta de tres fases: (1) presentaci\u00f3n; (2) votaci\u00f3n; y (3) implementaci\u00f3n. Cada fase y sus requisitos asociados se describen a continuaci\u00f3n. 1 . Env\u00edo de propuesta. Para ser elegible para votar, OP holder o su delegado debe presentar una propuesta de gobernanza v\u00e1lida en Token House. Esto significa que la propuesta debe ser:   Un tipo de propuesta v\u00e1lida. Todas las propuestas de gobernanza v0.1 deben estar dentro de una de las siguientes categor\u00edas:   Fondo de Gobernanza (Fase 0 o Fase 1)   Actualizaci\u00f3n de protocolo   Ajuste por inflaci\u00f3n   Destituci\u00f3n del director   Asignaciones del Treasury   Protecciones de derechos   Para obtener una descripci\u00f3n m\u00e1s detallada de cada tipo de propuesta, consulte \u201cProceso de propuesta: por tipo de propuesta\u201d a continuaci\u00f3n.   Correctamente formateado a la Plantilla aplicable. Cada tipo de propuesta tendr\u00e1 una plantilla espec\u00edfica asociada. Antes de la presentaci\u00f3n, el autor de una propuesta debe ajustar su propuesta al formato de la plantilla aplicable en todos los aspectos materiales. Esto incluir\u00e1, por el momento, el requisito de que todas las presentaciones se realicen en ingl\u00e9s.  Enviado a los foros correctos. Todas las propuestas de gobierno de Token House deben enviarse a Snapshot para su votaci\u00f3n. Si bien el uso del Optimism Forum es en su mayor\u00eda opcional, todas las propuestas del Fondo de Gobernanza (Fase 1) deben enviarse tanto al Foro como a Snapshot.  Finalmente, en la medida en que una propuesta de gobernanza se publique tanto en el Foro como en Snapshot, el contenido de esa propuesta debe ser id\u00e9ntico en ambas plataformas. Las propuestas enviadas deben cumplir con todos los criterios anteriores para ser consideradas v\u00e1lidas. Las propuestas no v\u00e1lidas ser\u00e1n descartadas. Cualquiera que env\u00ede una propuesta puede enviar una versi\u00f3n preliminar de la propuesta para recibir comentarios en el Optimism Forum. Para hacerlo, incl\u00faya [Draft]en el t\u00edtulo de su foro y luego actualice el t\u00edtulo de la propuesta una vez que el cuerpo de la propuesta est\u00e9 finalizado. 2 . Votaci\u00f3n Para minimizar los gastos generales, todas las votaciones se realizan en Snapshot a intervalos regulares llamados per\u00edodos de votaci\u00f3n. Los per\u00edodos de votaci\u00f3n comienzan cada jueves a las 7 p. m. GMT y finalizan 1 semana y 6 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, el mi\u00e9rcoles siguiente a las 7 p. m. GMT. Los tipos de propuestas pueden requerir uno o m\u00e1s per\u00edodos de votaci\u00f3n antes de que se pueda llegar a una resoluci\u00f3n para votar. Una propuesta de gobierno de Token House solo se aprobar\u00e1 si cumple con los siguientes umbrales m\u00ednimos de votos:   Qu\u00f3rum: El n\u00famero m\u00ednimo de votos OP totales requeridos para ser emitidos en relaci\u00f3n con una propuesta. Aqu\u00ed, el qu\u00f3rum se mide como un % del suministro total de OP votable .  El supply total de OP votable se determinar\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n de una estimaci\u00f3n razonable proporcionada por Optimism Foundation antes de cada per\u00edodo de votaci\u00f3n.    Umbral de aprobaci\u00f3n: El n\u00famero m\u00ednimo de votos OP requeridos para ser emitidos a favor de aprobar una propuesta. El umbral de aprobaci\u00f3n de cada propuesta se mide como un % de votos emitidos para aprobar (en relaci\u00f3n con el n\u00famero total de votos emitidos en relaci\u00f3n con) una propuesta .  Se tomar\u00e1 un snapshot para determinar el poder de voto de cada delegado o titular de OP al comienzo de un per\u00edodo de votaci\u00f3n determinado. Seg\u00fan el Tipo de Propuesta, los requisitos exactos de qu\u00f3rum y umbral de aprobaci\u00f3n pueden variar. 3 . Implementaci\u00f3n Las propuestas que sean rechazadas por invalidez o apoyo insuficiente pueden volver a presentarse. Las propuestas aprobadas se env\u00edan a Optimism Foundation para su implementaci\u00f3n, como se describe m\u00e1s detalladamente en la secci\u00f3n \u201cImplementaci\u00f3n y administraci\u00f3n\u201d a continuaci\u00f3n.

The Optimism Foundation administrar\u00e1 este proceso como se describe a continuaci\u00f3n. Administraci\u00f3n The Optimism Foundation facilitar\u00e1 la administraci\u00f3n de los procedimientos de gobierno descritos en este Manual operativo con el objetivo de garantizar que los OP holders puedan participar de manera eficiente y efectiva en la gobernanza de Token House. Dichos servicios administrativos pueden incluir:  Moderaci\u00f3n de las propuestas de gobernanza para garantizar que se presenten y voten v\u00e1lidamente; Eliminaci\u00f3n de propuestas que parezcan razonablemente fraudulentas, orientadas a correos no deseados, difamatorias, odiosas o inapropiadas o inconsistentes con los valores del Colectivo; Supervisi\u00f3n de los votos, el suministro de tokens votables y los per\u00edodos de votaci\u00f3n con el fin de determinar si se cumplen los qu\u00f3rumes y los umbrales de aprobaci\u00f3n; Gesti\u00f3n de propuestas contradictorias entre s\u00ed que se presentan simult\u00e1neamente o muy cerca unas de otras; Administraci\u00f3n del mantenimiento de la red, como correcci\u00f3n de errores de emergencia o reversi\u00f3n de versiones (con o sin voto de gobierno); y Las dem\u00e1s que la Fundaci\u00f3n estime convenientes en relaci\u00f3n con las anteriores.  Implementaci\u00f3n Las propuestas de gobernanza de Token House aprobadas se enviar\u00e1n a Optimism Foundation para su implementaci\u00f3n. Al recibir una propuesta aprobada, Optimism Foundation determinar\u00e1 si la propuesta es segura, consistente con los prop\u00f3sitos de la Fundaci\u00f3n y el Colectivo, y si se puede implementar de manera legalmente compatible.  En caso afirmativo, la Fundaci\u00f3n actuar\u00e1 con diligencia y de forma comercialmente razonable para que la propuesta se lleve a cabo. De no ser as\u00ed, la Fundaci\u00f3n puede eliminar la propuesta para volver a presentarla o hacer que la propuesta se implemente con ciertas medidas de seguridad, a su discreci\u00f3n, y junto con una explicaci\u00f3n al Colectivo de por qu\u00e9 la propuesta fue rechazada o limitada.  La Optimism Foundation emprender\u00e1 este trabajo ministerial con miras a descentralizar cada vez m\u00e1s su papel con el tiempo.  Enmiendas Los procedimientos descritos en este Manual operativo entrar\u00e1n en vigencia en el momento del Airdrop #1 y se ajustar\u00e1n m\u00e1s adelante en relaci\u00f3n con una serie de experimentos de gobernanza. Estos cambios incluyen, entre otros, la introducci\u00f3n de la C\u00e1mara de los Ciudadanos y la adici\u00f3n, eliminaci\u00f3n y modificaci\u00f3n de Tipos de propuestas y reglas relacionadas con los procesos de votaci\u00f3n. Cualquier actualizaci\u00f3n no administrativa del Manual de operaciones se reflejar\u00e1 con un nuevo n\u00famero de versi\u00f3n en la parte superior de este documento, momento en el que entrar\u00e1 en vigencia la versi\u00f3n actualizada.

The Optimism Forum : A platform for discussion and deliberation about governance proposals.   I mostly agree on the manual v0.1 here. Just one point to mention as open discussion whether the forum is the most situable tool as a discussion platform. For me there are benefit and limitations that we need to trade. Benefit  Format-oriented Topic-oriented It\u2019s a clean place where people would think and structure their opinions before actually submitting a reply which is pretty better than Discord.  Limitation  If participation is very high (say 10 pages), it may not be easy to follow what has been discussed so far. (I understand that forum works well for many protocols, but believe that the scale of OP governance we seek may consist of much more number of participants here)   To be honest, currently, I cannot think of a better alternative than the forum too, but just bring this in case anyone has an idea.

                    "content": "This document describes the current governance proposal process of the Optimism Collective. It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The authoritative version is maintained here on the Optimism Foundation Github.  Operating Manual v0.2.0: The Token House and OP Holders  Governance in the Optimism Collective begins with the launch of the Token House and its members, the OP holders. As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals. In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote their OP directly (by delegating their OP voting power to their own address), or delegate their OP voting power to an eligible third party. Addresses with delegated OP voting power are called \u201cdelegates.\u201d Delegates are expected to exercise their authority responsibly and in accordance with community standards. The Token House is just the first part of the Optimism Collective governance structure. Launch of the Citizens\u2019 House will soon follow and this Operating Manual will be updated accordingly.  Governance Toolkit  The primary tools for Optimism Collective governance are:   Snapshot: Where all Token House governance proposals are submitted for vote.  The Optimism Forum: A platform for discussion and deliberation about governance proposals.  Discord: For informal governance discussion and feedback.   Proposal Process  The Optimism Collective makes decisions through governance proposals. Proposals are accepted or rejected using a voting process. Anyone can submit a proposal to Optimism governance. The proposal must be one of the valid proposal types listed below, and it must follow the voting process described here.  Voting Process  The proposal Voting Cycle takes place in three one-week stages. Each \u201cweek\u201d runs from Wednesday at 19:00p GMT (12p PST) until Tuesday at 19:00 GMT (12p PST).  Week 1: Community feedback ([Draft])  In the first week, draft proposals are open for review by anyone in the Optimism community as a form of temperature check. Proposal authors are expected to be responsive to community feedback and use this period of time to prepare their proposal for more formal review. Proposals should be:  Submitted as a new discussion thread on the Governance Forum in the appropriate category. Marked with [Draft] in the title.  Once posted on the form create a discussion thread in the Optimism Discord in the #gov-temp-check channel. To create a thread simply click the \u201c+ Post\u201d button and fill in your name, your projects name, and the link to your draft proposal. For a proposal to proceed to Week 2 (delegate feedback), the author must update [Draft] to [Review] by Tuesday at 19:00 GMT (12:00p PST). Authors should also include a summary of incorporated feedback as a comment on their proposal thread so future reviewers can understand the proposal\u2019s progress. If feedback was gathered outside of the Forum (e.g. on Discord), proposal authors should include relevant links.  Week 2: Delegate feedback ([Review])  In the second week, Token House delegates are expected to provide feedback on proposals that (a) meet the requirements outlined in the proposal template, and (b) that have received feedback from the temperature check. Proposal authors are expected to engage in good faith and update their proposal based on what they believe makes sense for their project and the Optimism community. At the start of the Review Week, a governance administrator will create a Voting Cycle Roundup thread to collect all proposals that are ready for voting in Week 3. For a proposal to proceed to Week 3 (voting), two delegates with >0.5% of the current votable token supply must give explicit approval on the discussion thread. Delegates may not approve their own proposals. Delegates may signal approval by pasting the comment on the proposal discussion thread: \u201dI am an Optimism delegate [link to your delegate commitment] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\" After a proposal has received two delegate approvals, the proposal author should add a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread. If a proposal author does not get explicit delegate approval or wants more time for feedback, they should return the proposal to the [Draft] stage and continue to seek feedback from the community.  Week 3: Voting  In the third week, all delegates (including OP token holders who have self-delegated) are invited to vote on proposals on Snapshot. Proposals will be included in Snapshot only if they are (a) added to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread, and (b) have two approval comments from two delegates with >0.5% voting power. Without explicit delegate approval, proposals will not move to a Snapshot vote. A Token House governance proposal is approved if it satisfies the following minimum vote thresholds:   Quorum: The minimum number of total OP votes required to be cast in connection with a proposal. Here, a quorum is measured as a % of the total votable OP supply. \u201cVotable supply\u201d is the total amount of OP that has been delegated, and therefore can participate in voting. The total votable OP supply will be determined based on a reasonable estimate provided by the Optimism Foundation prior to each Voting Cycle. OP votable supply will be included in each Voting Roundup Thread.  Approval threshold: The minimum number of OP votes required to be cast in favor of approving a proposal. The approval threshold for each proposal is measured as % of votes cast to approve relative to the total number of votes cast in connection with a proposal.  A snapshot to determine voting power for each delegate will be taken at the commencement of a given voting period. Depending on the Proposal Type, exact quorum and approval threshold requirements may vary. For more information, refer to the proposal types below. If a proposal is submitted for a vote and does not pass, the proposal will not be executed. If a proposal author wishes to iterate on a proposal that has been rejected, they should:  Create a new proposal thread on the Forum. Include a link to the first proposal that did not pass. Clearly identify what has changed in the new proposal.   Valid Proposal Types  All v0.2 governance proposals must fall within one of the following categories:  Governance Fund (Phase 0 or Phase 1) Protocol Upgrade Inflation Adjustment Director Removal Treasury Appropriations Rights Protections  The different requirements for submission and approval of each Proposal Type are summarized below. In the table below, Quorum is the minimum % of votable OP supply actually voted. Approval Threshold is the minimum % of votes cast to approve relative to total votes cast.     Proposal Type Description Submission Requirements Vote Duration Quorum Approval Threshold     Governance Fund (Phase 1) OP distributions to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. Proposals should follow this template. Forum + Snapshot one three-week cycle 30% 51%   Protocol Upgrade Scheduled changes to the on-chain smart contracts comprising the mainnet Optimism protocol Snapshot three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 76%   Inflation Adjustment Changes to the inflation rate of newly minted OP (currently capped at 2% annually) Snapshot three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 76%   Director Removal Removal of a director of the Optimism Foundation Snapshot three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 76%   Treasury Appropriations The amount of OP the Optimism Foundation may spend or distribute annually, beginning in Year 2 of its existence (the Year 1 budget is 30% of the initial total OP supply) Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 51%   Rights Protections OP holders must consent to any changes to the founding documents of the Optimism Foundation, if those changes would materially reduce their rights Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 51%     Implementation and Administration  In all cases, Optimism Collective governance is intended to be carried out consistent with the terms of its Working Constitution, the spirit of its Contributor Code of Conduct and upcoming Delegate Code of Conduct, and the pursuit of its Optimistic Vision. The Optimism Foundation will steward this process as described below. Administration The Optimism Foundation will facilitate the administration of the governance procedures described in this Operating Manual with the aim of ensuring that OP holders may participate thoughtfully in Token House governance. Such administrative services may include:  Moderation of governance proposals to ensure they are validly submitted and voted upon; Removal of proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate or inconsistent with the values of the Collective; Monitoring of votes, the votable token supply, and voting periods for purposes of determining whether quorums and approval thresholds are met; Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted simultaneously or in close proximity to one another; Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release rollbacks (with or without a governance vote); and Such other things as the Foundation deems appropriate in connection with the above.  Implementation Approved Token House governance proposals will be routed to the Optimism Foundation for implementation. Upon receipt of an approved proposal, the Optimism Foundation will determine whether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the purposes of the Foundation and the Collective, and capable of being implemented in a legally compliant manner.  If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner to cause the proposal to be implemented. If it is not, the Foundation may remove the proposal for resubmission or cause the proposal to be implemented with certain guardrails, in its discretion, and coupled with an explanation to the Collective as to why the proposal was rejected or limited.  The Optimism Foundation will undertake this ministerial work with a view towards increasingly decentralizing its role over time.  Amendments  The procedures described in this Operating Manual will go into effect as releases are published on GitHub. Major releases to the manual will be made in connection with a series of governance experiments (\u201cSeasons\u201d). These changes include but are not limited to introducing the Citizens\u2019 House, and adding, removing, and modifying Proposal Types and rules relating to voting processes. Any non-clerical updates to the Operating Manual will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.  Process TLDR  Optimism has a three-week proposal review cycle. When you\u2019re ready, draft a proposal and post it on the Forum with [Draft] in the title for feedback from the community. Remember to post your proposal in the #gov-temp-check channel on Discord to get community feedback. When you\u2019re ready for formal review from Token House delegates, update [Draft] to [Review]. You are expected to have made an effort to get community feedback before submitting for formal review. During the next Review Week (every three weeks), delegates will provide feedback on your proposal. Use your judgment to incorporate feedback. Once your proposal has been approved for a vote by two delegates with >0.5% of voting supply, you may add a link to your proposal to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread. The proposal will be automatically added to Snapshot during the next one-week voting window. If your proposal is passed, the Optimism Foundation will facilitate its administration, including by distributing any approved OP grants. Note the Foundation may be in touch to collect additional information from your project in order to execute the grant. If your proposal fails, you can make a new proposal in the next cycle specifying how you have incorporated significant changes from your first proposal.  ",

                    "content": "This document describes the current governance proposal process of the Optimism Collective. It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The authoritative version is maintained here on the Optimism Foundation Github.  Operating Manual v0.2.1: The Token House and OP Holders  Governance in the Optimism Collective begins with the launch of the Token House and its members, the OP holders. As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of Optimism Collective governance proposals. In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote their OP directly (by delegating their OP voting power to their own address), or delegate their OP voting power to an eligible third party. Addresses with delegated OP voting power are called \u201cdelegates.\u201d Delegates are expected to exercise their authority responsibly and in accordance with community standards. The Token House is just the first part of the Optimism Collective governance structure. Launch of the Citizens\u2019 House will soon follow and this Operating Manual will be updated accordingly.  Governance Toolkit  The primary tools for Optimism Collective governance are:   Snapshot: Where all Token House governance proposals are submitted for vote.  The Optimism Forum: A platform for discussion and deliberation about governance proposals.  Discord: For informal governance discussion and feedback.   Proposal Process  The Optimism Collective makes decisions through governance proposals. Proposals are accepted or rejected using a voting process. Anyone can submit a proposal to Optimism governance. The proposal must be one of the valid proposal types listed below, and it must follow the voting process described here.  Voting Process  The proposal Voting Cycle takes place in three one-week stages. Each \u201cweek\u201d runs from Thursday at 19:00 GMT (12p PST) until Wednesday at 19:00 GMT (12p PST).  Week 1: Community and Delegate Feedback ([Draft])  In the first week, draft proposals are open for review by anyone in the Optimism community as a form of temperature check. Proposal authors are expected to be responsive to community and delegate feedback and use this period of time to prepare their proposal for committee review. Proposals should be:  Submitted as a new discussion thread on the Governance Forum in the appropriate category. Marked with [Draft] in the title.  Once posted on the form create a discussion thread in the Optimism Discord in the #gov-temp-check channel. To create a thread simply click the \u201c+ Post\u201d button and fill in your name, your projects name, and the link to your draft proposal. At the start of the Week 1, a governance administrator will create a Voting Cycle Roundup thread in the forum to collect all proposals that meet the requirements for committee review in Week 2. For a proposal to proceed to Week 2 (committee review), two delegates with >0.5% of the current votable token supply must give explicit approval on the discussion thread. Delegates may not approve their own proposals. Delegates may signal approval by pasting the following comment on the proposal discussion thread: \u201dI am an Optimism delegate [link to your delegate commitment] with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.\" If a committee member approves a proposal to move to a vote, it is not an endorsement of that proposal by the associated committee. It simply signifies that the proposal should move to the next stage of the cycle. After a proposal has received two delegate approvals, the proposal author should update the proposal title from [Draft] to [Review] and add a link to their proposal in the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 1 at 19:00 GMT (12:00p PST). Authors should also include a summary of incorporated feedback as a comment on their proposal thread so future reviewers can understand the proposal\u2019s progress. If feedback was gathered outside of the Forum (e.g. on Discord), proposal authors should include relevant links. If a proposal author does not get explicit delegate approval or wants more time for feedback, they should continue to seek feedback from the community and submit an updated proposal in the next voting cycle.  Week 2: Committee Review ([Review])  In the second week, committees will review all approved proposals listed on the Voting Cycle Roundup thread and publicly post their recommendations before the last day of Week 2 at 19:00 GMT (12:00p PST).  Week 3: Voting  In the third week, all delegates (including OP token holders who have self-delegated) are invited to vote on proposals on Snapshot. Proposals will be included in Snapshot only if they were (a) added to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread before the deadline, and (b) have two approval comments from two delegates with >0.5% voting power. Without explicit delegate approval, proposals will not move to a Snapshot vote. A Token House governance proposal is approved if it satisfies the following minimum vote thresholds:   Quorum: The minimum number of total OP votes required to be cast in connection with a proposal. Here, a quorum is measured as a % of the total votable OP supply. \u201cVotable supply\u201d is the total amount of OP that has been delegated, and therefore can participate in voting. The total votable OP supply will be determined based on a reasonable estimate provided by the Optimism Foundation prior to each Voting Cycle. OP votable supply will be included in each Voting Roundup Thread.  Approval threshold: The minimum number of OP votes required to be cast in favor of approving a proposal. The approval threshold for each proposal is measured as % of votes cast to approve relative to the total number of votes cast in connection with a proposal.  A snapshot to determine voting power for each delegate will be taken at the commencement of a given voting period, and voting will be hosted on the Optimism Collective Snapshot page. Depending on the Proposal Type, exact quorum and approval threshold requirements may vary. For more information, refer to the proposal types below. If a proposal is submitted for a vote and does not pass, the proposal will not be executed. If a proposal author wishes to iterate on a proposal that has been rejected, they should:  Create a new proposal thread on the Forum. Include a link to the first proposal that did not pass. Clearly identify what has changed in the new proposal.   Valid Proposal Types  All v0.2 governance proposals must fall within one of the following categories:  Governance Fund (Phase 0 or Phase 1) Protocol Upgrade Inflation Adjustment Director Removal Treasury Appropriations Rights Protections  The different requirements for submission and approval of each Proposal Type are summarized below. In the table below, Quorum is the minimum % of votable OP supply actually voted. Approval Threshold is the minimum % of votes cast to approve relative to total votes cast.     Proposal Type Description Submission Requirements Vote Duration Quorum Approval Threshold     Governance Fund (Phase 1) OP distributions to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. Proposals should follow this template. Forum + Snapshot one three-week cycle 30% 51%   Protocol Upgrade Scheduled changes to the on-chain smart contracts comprising the mainnet Optimism protocol Snapshot three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 76%   Inflation Adjustment Changes to the inflation rate of newly minted OP (currently capped at 2% annually) Snapshot three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 76%   Director Removal Removal of a director of the Optimism Foundation Snapshot three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 76%   Treasury Appropriations The amount of OP the Optimism Foundation may spend or distribute annually, beginning in Year 2 of its existence (the Year 1 budget is 30% of the initial total OP supply) Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 51%   Rights Protections OP holders must consent to any changes to the founding documents of the Optimism Foundation, if those changes would materially reduce their rights Proposals to be initiated by the Foundation three-week cycle plus two week extended vote window 30% 51%     Implementation and Administration  In all cases, Optimism Collective governance is intended to be carried out consistent with the terms of its Working Constitution, the spirit of its Contributor Code of Conduct and upcoming Delegate Code of Conduct, and the pursuit of its Optimistic Vision. The Optimism Foundation will steward this process as described below. Administration The Optimism Foundation will facilitate the administration of the governance procedures described in this Operating Manual with the aim of ensuring that OP holders may participate thoughtfully in Token House governance. Such administrative services may include:  Moderation of governance proposals to ensure they are validly submitted and voted upon; Removal of proposals that reasonably appear to be fraudulent, spam-oriented, defamatory, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate or inconsistent with the values of the Collective; Monitoring of votes, voting power, the votable token supply, and voting periods for purposes of determining whether quorums and approval thresholds are met or accurately reflected. In the event of bugs in the Snapshot tool, the Foundation may manually count votes and override the results of a Snapshot vote \u2013 however, it will only do so where the the expected, bug-free outcome is unambiguous (for example, votes that are verifiable on-chain, but which did not propagate to the off-chain Snapshot tool); Management of mutually contradictory proposals that are submitted simultaneously or in close proximity to one another; Administration of network maintenance, such as emergency bug fixes or release rollbacks (with or without a governance vote); and Such other things as the Foundation deems appropriate in connection with the above.  Implementation Approved Token House governance proposals will be routed to the Optimism Foundation for implementation. Upon receipt of an approved proposal, the Optimism Foundation will determine whether the proposal is safe, secure, consistent with the purposes of the Foundation and the Collective, and capable of being implemented in a legally compliant manner.  If it is, the Foundation will act diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner to cause the proposal to be implemented. If it is not, the Foundation may remove the proposal for resubmission or cause the proposal to be implemented with certain guardrails, in its discretion, and coupled with an explanation to the Collective as to why the proposal was rejected or limited.  The Optimism Foundation will undertake this ministerial work with a view towards increasingly decentralizing its role over time.  Amendments  The procedures described in this Operating Manual will go into effect as releases are published on GitHub. Major releases to the manual will be made in connection with a series of governance experiments (\u201cSeasons\u201d). These changes include but are not limited to introducing the Citizens\u2019 House, and adding, removing, and modifying Proposal Types and rules relating to voting processes. Any non-clerical updates to the Operating Manual will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect.  Process TLDR  Optimism has a three-week proposal review cycle. When you\u2019re ready, draft a proposal and post it on the Forum with [Draft] in the title for feedback from the community and delegates. Remember to post your proposal in the #gov-temp-check channel on Discord to get community feedback. Delegates will also provide feedback on your proposal in the forum. Use your judgment to incorporate feedback. Once your proposal has been approved by two delegates with >0.5% of voting supply, add a link to your proposal to the Voting Cycle Roundup thread by the last day of Week 1 and update the title from [Draft] to [Review]. These proposals will move on to Week 2: Committee Review. Committees will provide recommendations on proposals by the last day of Week 2. These proposals will be automatically added to Snapshot during the next one-week voting window. If your proposal is passed, the Optimism Foundation will facilitate its administration, including by distributing any approved OP grants. Note the Foundation may be in touch to collect additional information from your project in order to execute the grant. If your proposal fails, you can make a new proposal in the next cycle specifying how you have incorporated significant changes from your first proposal.  ",
