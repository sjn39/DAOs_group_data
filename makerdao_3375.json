                    "content": "I was reading through the Fei Protocol whitepaper. It\u2019s a new stablecoin protocol, financially backed by a16z and Coinbase. The authors claim that Fei is able to use \u201cdynamic mint rewards and burn penalties on DEX trade volume to maintain the peg\u201d. If I understand correctly, the protocol retains added value from purchases above the peg and uses this to bring the peg back up when it dips below. I think this will allow Fei to maintain its peg without needing as much collateral to back it. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong on any of this. I just wanted to bring attention to this new mechanism and check to see if Maker would be able to add a similar \u201cdirect incentive\u201d mechanism.   fei.money    whitepaper.7d5e2986.pdf 720.85 KB      ",

Contrary to Maker that uses DAI-denominated loans as DAI collateral, they will have ETH. This can be a good thing obviously if ETH price increases. But it can lead to a bank run and the end of the project if ETH price decreases. Celo was lucky, there now have $120M of crypto-assets (excluding CELO) to back $42M of stablecoin. Obviously, the cUSD owners did carry the risk and were not compensated for that. ",

                    "content": "So I read over this as well. Here are some of my thoughts (possibly I\u2019m misunderstanding some stuff, but not sure.)   The dynamic burn (mint too) penalties are only applied to specific trading venues. So far as I can tell, that will just cause people to find new venues to avoid burn and will lead to apparent price dislocations across trading venues because the \u2018visible\u2019 rate doesn\u2019t take into account the burn.   Users providing liquidity in incentivised pools directly benefit from reweight operations by the protocol. This directly sucks value out of the protocol and towards LPs. The weight of this grows as there are more external LPs, and I see no reason why the ratio of external LPs to protocol LP wouldn\u2019t increase given this.   ETH dropping in price puts pressure on the reweight mechanism, potentially leading to the scenario @SebVentures describes.   I\u2019m not sure these are critical issues though, and I\u2019m excited to see if it works. ",
