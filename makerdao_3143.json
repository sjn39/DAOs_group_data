We can take advantage of this by floping some MKR to rapidly build the buffer. If we set a starting bid of $1750, 2300 MKR can be issued to immediately expand the surplus buffer to 8MM, doubling our risk bandwidth for high-demand collateral types like ETH-A and ETH-B. It might be a controversial position that we should use the Flop mechanism in good times rather than as a last-resort mechanism. However companies in growth mode issue equity all the time to fund expansion when the equity is at a high price. I think it makes sense to capitalize on the recent price rise by raising some funds now that we have burned several thousand MKR at an average price around $600. ",

We are currently burning ~50k usd of MKR/day, and I think this is good enough for increasing the SB over time. We should burn all the time: when MKR is high and when MKR is low.

Looks like we have majority support on raising the SB to $10M but are still split regarding if we should continue to burn while the SB is filled (and at what rate). Even if we could flop, I would be opposed as I still believe MKR is significantly undervalued despite the rally and we will be diverting fees to increase the SB over time per the Surplus Buffer signal request.
