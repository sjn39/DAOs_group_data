Paragraph Summary Add @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security.  Specification  Motivation I have worked as Deputy Facilitator for Immunefi Security since its inception on Dec 2021 and, during part of its incubation period under SES, two month prior (Oct and Nov 2021). I have taken charge of the accounting, written status updates, and contributed to our core unit\u2019s goals. Our current Facilitator, @travinimmunefi, continues to lead with long-term strategic planning, but is stretched thin by his many other responsibilities. Often, when Travin has scheduling conflicts, I am asked to attend the weekly Mandated Actor\u2019s meeting in his place. This MIP formalizes what is essentially already the status quo.

In my first attempt to onboard, the MIP marinated on the forum for two months before I received any critical comments. To preserve the option enter the August cycle, I posted this MIP again yesterday; already some Recognized Delegates have commented. I\u2019m glad to have your prompt attention. As @Doo_StableLab and @rspa suggested, I want to offer some reflections on the recently rejected vote. I examined ballots cast with more than 33 MKR.  Feedback Received    On my performance      Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Platform   When you\u2019re a facilitator you should more than likely disclosed that your post is your personal Opinion and not the voice of your Core Unit.   I haven\u2019t been doing that. As a rough guideline, posts with the is-001 tag are official ISCU comms and everything else is my personal opinion. I will try to be explicit in the future.    Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Platform   A facilitator needs to be a Motivator, a peacemaker, a guide, bridge builder, and among other things a praiser. And Josh lacks these traits   @flipflopflapdelegate wrote a five paragraph explanation for his vote that is hard to summarize, but maybe this quoted chunk sums it up. Thank you for your feedback. I will renew my efforts to broadcast Facilitator vibe.  0x4303c\u2026e46a wrote, \u201cAgree with the sentiments about Joshua. Good community member but he does not have the right skillset to be a facilitator.\u201d Hm, okay, I appreciate hearing your feedback. In a DM, @JustinCase re-iterated roughly the same feedback as already considered in this section.  Focus on the Core Unit, not me   @MakerMan abstained but commented, \u201cwonder if a facilitator is even needed to manage Immunefi.\u201d @ChrisBlec voted No and commented, \u201cIt is not apparent why ImmuneFi should be a CU at all. It should be contracted with the DAO and should have stricter obligations, metrics and general oversight than CUs have.\u201d This is helpful. I have been nervous when some of ISCU\u2019s promised deliverables were delayed, but I also wanted to give ample opportunity for our partners succeed. Clearly, we cannot continue to operate with such elastic deadlines. ISCU is pivoting to act on this feedback.  Alternate vote tally About 68,500 worth of anonymous MKR vote No. I listed the larger of these addresses in the No Contact Information section below. Since these voters did not offer feedback and there is no way to contact them, I cannot address their concerns. If I don my optimistic rose-colored glasses  then we can ignore these voters and the MIP lost 20k yes to 30k no. While the August cycle is possible, I won\u2019t move this MIP from RFC to voting until I am confident that I can at least win among identifable voters.  No contact information   I would appreciate it if the following voters could provide some feedback on why they voted No:     Voter Amount     0xbba4c\u202665d8 18,829 MKR   0x34bbf\u20260942 10,527 MKR   0x49d56\u20261be5 9,000 MKR   Shadow Delegate 5,976 MKR   0x000be\u20266549 5,745 MKR   0x09202\u202696eb 5,000 MKR   0x250a1\u2026079e 5,000 MKR   0x451f4\u20262188 5,000 MKR   0x4c0b1\u2026ae7a 4,301 MKR   0xcc1d8\u20266204 2,900 MKR   0xd8bba\u2026dfc4 1,250 MKR   0x5a849\u2026160f 1,001 MKR     0x07294\u2026a84e 632.81 MKR   0x11c90\u20269241 45.58 MKR     Abstained  Thank you for support   schuppi, Doo, ACREinvest, monetsupply, 0x4d342\u202605ce  Special mention   Flipside Crypto, Hasu, Feedblack Loops LLC, Penn Blockchain, GFX Labs, gauntlet, [email\u00a0protected], and mhonkasalo & teemulau abstained and did not have additional feedback.

This proposal seeks to onboard @psychonaut (Jpritikin Industries, Inc) as a co-Facilitator for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security. If the onboarding proposal is ratified, @psychonaut will be added as a second facilitator to IS-001  This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here. Onboardings of Core Units and Facilitators will be marked as high-impact due to the facilitator\u2019s powers and ability to impact Core unit budget decisions. This proposal has met its required time in RFC, and can enter the next monthly cycle, provided the frozen period and formal submission window guidelines are followed.

However, I plan to reattempt onboarding once I feel that I may have overcome the reasons for the rejection. Hence, I am putting this 2nd attempt into RFC and will not put it up for vote until later.  I am aware that the EndGame MIP set has passed and that Core Units may evolve into a different organizational model. However, ISCU needs to operate today. Along with a budget renewal and mandate refresh, it seems like a reasonable opportunity to advanced my 2nd onboarding attempt to a vote. As primary bug triager and Deputy Facilitator, I already hold a high trust role in the Maker ecosystem. I ask for official recognition of my more-or-less pre-existing role in the approval of my Facilitator candidacy.  @MIP-Editors Pls advance this MIP to formal submission for the Nov cycle. ",
