The first one we chose was Gnosis Safe. We believe that a multisig can play a crucial role in multiple Core Units, and it\u2019s interesting to know how to do it properly. I\u2019m with John Ennis from the Gnosis Safe Ecosystem Development,  and he will briefly go through what Gnosis is, what a multisig is, what the use cases are, and how to actually use it. For other episodes of Core Unit Tools, please check the forum.

Dapps1920\u00d71080 134 KB   07:17 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: The grants were being run by the Maker Foundation, and now we are migrating that towards the DAO, so for sure this is one of the use cases where we\u2019ll be seeing it. And the other one is \u2013 most of the viewers probably know this, but Governance is using that to manage the budgets that it has received from the DAO to assign that to the different invoices or expenses   Who should use...?1920\u00d71080 69.3 KB   Getting Started1920\u00d71080 145 KB   &quot;How many owners?&quot;&quot;1920\u00d71080 178 KB   14:01 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the wallets, is Gnosis Safe a wallet\u2026? I don\u2019t want to say \u201clike Metamask\u201d, but is it a wallet on its own or can you use it for multisigs?   14:54 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Would anyone potentially use the Gnosis Safe without the multisig, just to access their smart contracts and whatnot?   Welcome to Gnosis Safe Multisig1920\u00d71080 172 KB   15:47 - Payton Rose: One of the considerations we\u2019ve been talking about with multisigs within Maker is that in the future we might want to use them for certain permission actions, like putting a group in charge of changing rates or something down the line where we say \u201cOk, we\u2019re gonna trust this group\u201d and delegate it off. Would the same type of Gnosis Safe be of use or would you need to set up a separate one for permissioned actions?   19:22 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Could you have a Gnosis Safe without connecting something like Metamask? Could you have your seed directly input into Gnosis Safe?   &quot;Owners and confirmations&quot;1920\u00d71080 146 KB   &quot;Maker Team Safe&quot;1920\u00d71080 149 KB   Safe Creation Process1920\u00d71080 129 KB   Assets1920\u00d71080 140 KB   25:37 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: When you create the safe originally, you have to sign and pay the ether to set up that smart contract. And then what we would see here is whatever the smart contract is holding, which would be zero after creation   Manage List1920\u00d71080 144 KB   Send Funds1920\u00d71080 157 KB   Transactions1920\u00d71080 171 KB   29:37 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: When I\u2019m a co-signer, I see the nonce go up and I\u2019m not paying any gas. Someone told me \u201cThat\u2019s because the nonce on your wallet, it\u2019s the nonce on the smart contract of the safe\u201d. Buy how does that happen from a technical point of view?   30:51 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Who pays the gas when initiating a transaction? Maybe the last one to sign or the last signature required?   35:44 - Tim Black: The custom apps are all reliant on a URL, right?   Add custom app1920\u00d71080 135 KB   36:01 - Frank Cruz: Do you still have to give permission to the app to spend your Dai, USDC, whatever?   How to connect to a Dapp1920\u00d71080 159 KB   41:58 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Do you need a multisig to change this settings?   42:39 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: If you had a couple of people working with you and you assign them a budget, you could say \u201cOk, this is the spending limit that you have for the next month\u201d \u2013 it could be your salary or if you need to pay invoices and then you can just free them up. Right?   43:22 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: I don\u2019t know if you can set daily limits or \u201cYou can spend up to 1K per day\u201d\u2026   New Spending Limit1920\u00d71080 164 KB   45:01 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Every time one of these settings is changed, you need to pay gas, right?   45:20 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Are you guys planning on going to an L2 at some point?   46:47 - Payton Rose: Are there any sort of best practices around number of signers? We obviously like n-1, for instance, but when writing our latest multi-sig MIP I didn\u2019t want to be too restrictive, so I said at least two-thirds of the signers. No idea if that was a good recommendation or not   49:52 - Frank Cruz: If you have five individuals participating in the multisig, you said you could send out a text message, so in the case of an emergency \u2014say we need some action taken\u2014, how would that work if one of the multisig individuals is in Tulum, M\u00e9xico, having himself a margarita and is not responding to the text messages?   51:51 - Frank Cruz: How do you keep that data safe if people give up their phone number? It\u2019s optional, right? You can choose to just be contacted by e-mail or Telegram\u2026  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro  John where can people find more about you and about Gnosis? (52:38). Thank you, John, for joining us. It was really nice to have you.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
