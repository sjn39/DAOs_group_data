                    "content": "I want to highlight a trend in the comments I\u2019ve seen from stewards over the last week of budgeting season.  The main trend I see is a complaint about a lack of lean-ness and a lack of effectiveness. Here are some comments:  Kyle Weiss    Treasury Diversification Working Group Updates Thread   The bear is here and it\u2019s only going to get worse over the next 6-12mos. Crypto markets are tied closer to the US stock market than they have ever been (and global markets), and the US Fed doesn\u2019t give a shit if they tank the stock market trying to get inflation under control. The general sentiment is that Investors across Web3 are slowing investment and feel like they can wait ~8mos to scoop up a lot of \u201cgood deals\u201d as token prices, valuations and shitty projects are going to die out over the next 6-12mos. This news is not all doomsday for Gitcoin though! Gitcoin has an incredible brand and deep reason for existing that is of interest to many of the folks I have had a chance to chat with. there are headwinds though as money is tightening, and scrutiny is finally being applied to most funding decisions (ie, folks are asking about longevity of projects and roadmaps again!). It\u2019s through these conversations and conversations with other DAOs, and protocols that I have learned and deeply believe Gitcoin is not in a position to fuck around - we need to really focus on the core thesis that we are a protocol DAO with great impact (funding for public goods). gets on soap box for impact Season after season we have failed to really make progress on our Protocol development, but continue to grow budgets. To top it off GR13 shrank quite dramatically, likely due to market sentiment. This trend will continue and we will continue to see funding dry up where it was once bountiful. Our community needs us to survive and to thrive, web3 needs us to survive. Gitcoin is the light that fuels the ecosystem through bear markets and we can only do that with funding ourselves, and an eye towards the most important thing (advancing our protocol to make grants permissionless and pervasive).    Anonymous Steward  I was going to bring up in the call today but transparently I am concerned about dao long term funding sustainability given many $500k-$1m requests for 1 season which ends up around $5m total for the season and each season only seems to be getting larger with requests  I have not gotten permission from this Steward to quote them by name, but they are in the top 15.  Austin Griffith Austin told me at ETHAmsterdam 2022 that he felt like we were not meeting our moment (\u201cyoure fucking it up\u201d).  Software projects at Gitcoin that he\u2019s seen typically take too long to ship, have too much overhead, and when they come out, come out buggy or otherwise miss the market. Gitcoin is routinely beaten to market (or otherwise out-executed) by projects with massively less resources (money, clout, people) than us.  Lefteris   twitter.com    Lefteris Karapetsas | Hiring for @rotkiapp @LefterisJP  A DAO without a clear goal is just a fat cow filled with cash to be milked by subgroups each with its own idea of what the goal of the DAO should be.  The more generic the stated goal of the DAO the easier to fall into this trap.   12:47 AM - 4 May 2022           232                24             My view My view is this:  Gitcoin is unfortunately a ProtocolDAO without a Protocol. The DAO spends millions of dollars in tokens on things that just don\u2019t have ROI. The DAO has a habit of starting many projects in many different directions.  The DAO workstreams regularly start projects that are \u201ca few weeks away\u201d from shipping, but drag on for months or just never ship. Because the workstream proposals are so large/dense, and stewards have little context, it is hard for these project owners to be held accountable.  These are precarious positions to be in at the start (middle) of a bear market. I believe in Gitcoin\u2019s mission.  I think that stewarding an open source project is a lot like gardening.  I\u2019ve been pulling a lot of weeds in my home garden.  I consider posts like this to be like weeding our garden.  I believe in Gitcoin, and I believe that by pulling at these weeds, we can have our execution meet our moment. What would have to be true to have a more lean/effective Gitcoin that is focused on achieving its mission?  What would have to be true to get the protocol shipped + used by the world? What would have to be true for us to be comfortable with the long term sustainability of Gitcoin?  How would we act differently in times of scarcity vs the times of relative abundance that we\u2019ve seen over the last year? ",

I\u2019ve been following the budget proposals closely for past few cycles, and it is clear that workstreams do not remotely appreciate how GTC is set up for a rapidly approaching death spiral in this market.  The requests are not tethered to reality and continually increase despite very little return to the outward facing Gitcoin product.  Funding personnel reviews, meme parties, random new hires, and developer larks is not acceptable in this current market and do not align with Gitcoin\u2019s stated mission of developing public goods.  I am very concerned that R14 will pale in comparison to R13, which itself was down from R12.  This is not a good place to be in and shows just how much the workstreams have taken eye off the ball during the times of plenty. GTC must be given more utility, or the market will not continue to support the constant downward pressure put on GTC by the workstreams.  Giveth is a fantastic example of how Gitcoin could bootstrap a simple staking mechanism, that should be explored immediately.  Additionally, workstreams must be vetted far more critically, and the leads should not take offense when stewards express very real concerns over just how much they are paying themselves for work of questionable utility.  Hopefully these are growing pains, but Gitcoin is no longer just the small little group of friends, and frankly needs to grow up. ",

Lunacat:  why do you think chatter on this forum dies whenever someone broaches topic of GTC? I fear people are overly sensitive to [overblown] concerns over poorly understood securities laws\u2026   I agree that we need to be focused on utility for GTC. Utility for a token does not make it a security, promising an economic return will. This is why these things are interwoven at times (more utility may mean more value\u2026 more value may mean a higher price and invite unhealthy speculation). You are spot on @Lunacat that S14 has the potential to be wildly out of control without more prudence on spending. I can assure you that many of the stewards (myself included) are evaluating the results of workstreams after giving them blank checks for nearly a year now. I think in S14 you will start to see a couple workstreams really focus on our Grants Protocol and GTC utility. IMO, the Grants 2.0 protocol is needed before we can build any \u201creal\u201d utility into GTC. Others have built gimicky \u201cutility\u201d and we have tried to stay away from this trend. ",

The problem of funding opensource is not solved. Widening the scope of the DAO beyond that does not help but does exactly the opposite.   7:56 AM - 15 May 2022           3              twitter.com    Lefteris Karapetsas | Hiring for @rotkiapp @LefterisJP  @owocki @Sim_Pop There is a big difference between the goals of \"Fund public goods\", and \"Create an efficient funding mechanism\".  Goal 1 is too broad.  Gitcoin needs to switch from a social DAO with grand stated goals to become a lean product development team/DAO to accomplish Grants 2.0 / QF.   8:51 AM - 15 May 2022           2            ",

This whole data collection and KYC thing is not cool. I understand QF needs that, but it is just not a cool thing because it introduces so much friction and data security risks. It also excludes people that cant do KYC. not nice. Wish there was something like gitcoin but without QF and all this data collection. Maybe rethink if QF is really a good idea or if there are alternatives that dont require such strong sybill resistance. Which kind of alternatives have you explored? so much friction could be reduced by getting rid of QF. ",
