                    "content": " Thanks for reading the monthly update of the DUX (Development & UX) Core Unit! These updates serve as a vehicle for transparency with regards to our work and focus. We aim to stick to the format suggested by @Artem_Gordon of GovComms. In addition to these lower-timeframe updates we do quarterly roadmap updates on the Forum. Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr February 2022 was an unusual but productive and important month for our team. Instead of the usual design & development sprints on the Governance Portal with a two-week release cadence, we have spent the whole month working on a thorough code refactor and technical research, followed by an intense team offsite scheduled around the ETHDenver conference. The time invested in February has laid the groundwork for a bunch of new features and cross-CU initiatives that our team will be executing on over the coming months.   Product updates We have been focussing on three workstreams last month; a thorough code refactor of the Governance Portal, technical research into gasless voting mechanisms, and a redesigned landing page.  Governance Portal code refactor At the end of last year we decided to take on the biggest chunk of technical debt related to the Governance Portal; its dependencies on dai.js\u2014a library built by Maker developers earlier (pre-DAO) which enables basic web3 functionalities (eg. connecting to wallets, smart contract calls) and interactions with the Maker system (eg. interacting with Vaults). These days the web3 ecosystem is sprawling and some open-source libraries ended up becoming a more efficient and developer-friendly alternative to dai.js. In addition, maintaining the library adds huge overhead to our team when we\u2019d rather focus on the Governance Portal codebase. The code refactor will make the Governance Portal more reliable (ie. stable and secure) but also easier to maintain and work with. Our team has worked hard on researching technical solutions and rigorously refactoring the codebase. With rigorous I\u2019m talking 280 commits and 382 files changed so far.  We\u2019re nearly there and the upcoming Governance Portal release will feature the refactored codebase, in addition to new features and improvements.  Gasless voting research The second workstream we have been focussing on is researching mechanisms for gasless poll voting. Decreasing the friction of participating in Maker governance is our single biggest priority at this point since we believe it\u2019s an important lever in increasing governance participation. We have looked into various options, ranging from an integration with Snapshot to more bespoke (ie. custom-built) solutions. We have converged onto a few potential implementations which we will pitch to select CUs for feedback in the upcoming two weeks. Stay tuned for more info!  Landing page redesign While our engineers were working on the above, our designer Tiago has been working on a redesign for the Governance Portal\u2019s landing page. We kicked off the initiative earlier this year through an ideation session in which we brainstormed which functionalities and what data should be displayed there. The landing page redesign also inspired us to rethink our data architecture\u2014the result is a snappier Governance Portal which is more comfortable fetching large amounts of data at once. Keep your eye out for the redesign!   Team updates  Team offsite & ETHDenver conference Our entire team of six has met in Denver, CO for a two-week team offsite and conference visit. It\u2019s been an intense but fruitful time; we spent quality time together as a team and had the opportunity to advance on some more difficult topics through an on-site workshop and low-key discussions. In addition we were able to connect with quite a few MakerDAO folks outside of our own team and discuss various topics that transcend a single CU\u2019s mandate. We felt a strong and confident Maker presence throughout the conference, manifested not only by the sheer number of MakerDAO affiliated individuals (CU members, delegates, etc) attending but also through talks and panels, and ofcourse the incredible DAIvinity party hosted by MakerDAO. It definitely feels like the brand perception of Maker has increased compared to a year ago. Big ups to @Growth-Core-Unit for their work which brought us here. Lastly we had some fruitful encounters and conversations with individuals from other teams (eg. Yearn, Aave, Gitcoin) about protocol DAO governance challenges amongst other topics. I\u2019m convinced that the connections and conversations that were formed during this offsite have planted seeds which will lead to initiatives later this year.  Facilitator role switch As seen on the forum in January [1] [2], @bainpm formally handed over the CU facilitator role to @0xdeniz in order to fully focus on coding, research and architecture design. The governance proposal passed which formalised the graceful transition.

Welcome to our first monthly update\u2014we\u2019re moving away from Sprint reviews to this new, crisp and clear format.  What happened in December?  CU Governance & Administration  Rejection of the SAS Budget Extension MIP at the end of November: Mainly due to doubt on the relevance of the Auctions Mandate and the encouragement of delegates to turn SAS into an Ecosystem Actor asap. SAS got involved in Endgame (more details in the respective section) SAS secured funding until end of March 2023   Endgame Mandate  Strategic  After several discussions with Endgame stakeholders, SAS will become a trusted custom software development service provider for SubDAOs with a Full-Stack offering: Smart contract and decentralized frontend development services accompanied by infrastructure work SAS joined the Governance-Security Group to understand where we can help best during the Pre Game Phase. Based on these discussions, SAS is currently preparing a proposal to develop a Smart Contract Toolkit for SubDAOs.   Technical  SAS kicked off Smart Contract Development in December to make sure our processes meet the quality and security standards of Maker SAS researched and established end-to-end testing capabilities that include both solidity- and Typescript-based testing. This is important for our Full-Stack approach. Analysis of several exchange callee contracts written by PE to get familiar with general structure and desired code style (issue). Development of a new exchange-callee contract that connects Maker to 1inch. The contract and its test were published and currently awaiting a review (PR). The development of the contract heavily benefited from the Full-Stack approach: The communication with the 1inch aggregation router contract required off-chain data as an input. This is hard to impossible using only Solidity-based tests.   Sunsetting Auctions  SAS decided to wind down auction-related work to the absolute minimum. We will keep ensuring that the services are working and up-to-date (e.g. for new collaterals). Now supporting GNO collateral in the Unified Auctions UI and keeper. Started packaging the Unified Auctions UI into a Desktop application to reduce the barrier to run the application locally is reduced to almost 0 (Download + Double-Click).   Outlook January  Moving forward on the described development streams (Callee Contract and Desktop App) Conceptualizing and Discussing the Smart Contract Toolkit for SubDAOs proposal Understanding and discussing Endgame Scopes to identify other work items Prepare a new MIP to secure operations beyond March 2023.

Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr In April we delivered two updates to the Governance Portal, featuring a redesign and various features & improvements. In parallel we have been progressing on our R&D projects, such as gasless poll voting. In addition to the product-related work we\u2019ve delivered a full-day workshop focussed on DAO governance challenges, as part of the devconnect event in Amsterdam . We invited DAO governance thinkers and doers from other web3 projects (eg. leaders from yearn, Element, Radicle and more) and built a relationship with them. @0xdeniz gave a talk at devconnect based on the workshop output.   Product updates We deployed two updates to the Governance Portal last month, and we\u2019ve made progress on R&D projects.  Governance Portal updates On April 5th we released an update which featured \u2018Share your Vote\u2019\u2014It enables voters to directly share their poll votes and comments to Twitter and the Governance Forum. This shrinks the gap between the Governance Portal and the Forum, makes the lives of recognized delegates a bit easier and also aims to make voting a bit more interactive. The release also included other minor improvements to commenting, various smaller optimisations, and UI improvements. On April 28th we launched another major update to the Governance Portal which features a redesign\u2014mainly focussed on providing a more relevant and useful landing page, which serves both as the first touchpoint for users that are new to MakerDAO governance, and serves as a dashboard for existing users. The release also included various smaller improvements.  Research & Development As explained in last month\u2019s CU update; DUX team has slowly shifted focus from isolated GovPortal work towards more research and cross-CU collaboration.  In April we\u2019ve made progress on an implementation for gasless poll voting and presented remaining design decisions to GovAlpha. We\u2019re currently iterating and are moving towards a final design, upon which we can start development.  We are continuing to look into ways to speed up the Governance Portal and improve stability by optimising data fetching. We are currently performing a root cause analysis related to some issues in the GovPortal stack which result in intermittent errors and flakey tests. For the longer-term we\u2019re considering a dedicated application/service that serves as a data aggregator, which would relieve this duty from the GovPortal application.   Team updates  Contributions to Devconnect event    Last month DUX team made a significant contribution to Devconnect\u2014a week-long conference in Amsterdam, organised by the Ethereum Foundation. We had our sights set on a sub-event called Global Governance Gathering, organised by the folks at The DAOist. The event was focussed on improving the state of DAO governance and attracted DAO thinkers and doers from all over the web3 space. We recognized the event as an opportunity to connect with fellow governance thinkers and bring some more exposure to our work at MakerDAO. @tiago and @0xdeniz designed and facilitated a full-day design sprint workshop and put in a $6.5k sponsorship (thanks to @Growth-Core-Unit ) The workshop was conducted with 11 carefully selected participants (leaders from organisations like yearn, Element and Radicle) and was hugely successful. More importantly; we forged a relationship with this group of people that will likely be valuable over time. We\u2019ve established a Telegram chat group and will hopefully be in touch over the months/years to come. More details about the workshop were shared on the Governance & Risk Meeting #187 [video segment available here, transcript available here]. On day 2 of the DAOist GGG22 event @0xdeniz went on-stage and gave a talk about the workshop purpose and output [video recording available here] and embedded below       Besides the above contribution, three out of six DUX CU members were in Amsterdam for the Devconnect conference and connected with other MakerDAO community members, but also made connections with other web3 folks. The conference week turned out great, with some valuable new connections forged and some decent exposure to our work generated    Do you have any feedback or feature requests for the Governance Portal, or ideas for improving Maker\u2019s governance UX in general?

Read along to learn about our priorities and DAO-facing work from last month.  June Priorities  GovComms Redesign As I\u2019ve mentioned in prior monthly updates, MakerDAO is changing and our team is adapting to shifting assumptions and needs. We\u2019ve continued developing the vision and practical understanding of the team redesign by engaging with several CUs, delegates, and community members to gather feedback to refine our plans. We intend to have a mandate refresh published within the next month or two. At a high level, we are considering moving towards a DAO Operations Support & Delegate Comms characterization, though we are still validating whether this direction makes sense.  1600\u00d7554 227 KB  Additionally, we explored what a merge would look like between GovAlpha and our team and came to the conclusion that it wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in cost savings. Planning and executing such an action requires a significant amount of time and energy, which we don\u2019t believe is worth the uncertain benefits.  Collaborating Towards Better Calls As MakerDAO has grown, existing calls have not kept up with the organization\u2019s needs and so we partnered with @dux-core-unit to bring together a working group of CU members and Delegates to explore the problem and come towards short and long term improvement proposals.  1291\u00d7805 231 KB  Read a synopsis of our findings here. The next steps are to propose and implement some immediate changes while working towards a more holistic framework for decentralized operations at MakerDAO in partnership with SES, GOV, and DUX.  Communications Audit  1319\u00d7545 43.5 KB  The second iteration of the Core Unit Communications Audit has been in progress during the month of June. The audit evaluates the procedures and methods each Core Unit is utilizing to deliver their messages. This is a change in focus from the previous audit, performed last year, where we covered all of the existing Core Units communication outputs and made recommendations for improving the outputs. The objectives of this audit are to determine whether the community is able to obtain Core Unit team updates, budget information, and strategic goals, and to examine all Core Unit written communication goals and determine if they are being fulfilled.  Continued Progress on Objectives Admin - @Davidutro In a step towards standardizing Core Unit financial reporting at MakerDAO, we\u2019ve updated our financials to fit the new CapEx table provided by @strat-fin-core-unit. This should also be compatible with the upcoming SES Budget Tool. Content - @Artem_Gordon Weekly Relay - Modified the \u201cCurrent Events\u201d and \u201cThis Week in Governance\u201d sections to include a little more information and activity related to governance and recognized delegates. Created and pinned a continuous thread to improve accessibility and reduce forum noise. Forum at a Glance - Created and pinned a continuous thread to improve accessibility and reduce forum noise.  745\u00d7355 20.2 KB  State of Dai - Now shared on MakerDAO Twitter in collaboration with Growth. Monthly Core Unit Updates - Updated the Core Unit Updates Tracker Sheet to reflect new Core Units and Teams. Call Summaries - Minor formatting improvements to the transcription of votes, MIPs, and Forum sections for G&R calls. Engagement - @thomas.flitter Supported new calls - These included the Wednesday and Thursday Decentralized Voter Committee calls, the Governance from First Principles call, and Delegate Office Hours starting in July. Tracked participation - We continue to experiment with participation tracking as a form of call support. Delegate attendance is tracked for the Voter Committee Calls. While stakeholder attendance is tracked for stakeholder alignment calls to help identify the number of contributors taking an active role in these important strategic initiatives. Progress on the Stakeholder database - We\u2019ve working with TechGDPR to review our draft policies that need to be in place before we can implement the next steps. Other Programs - @Davidutro Emergency Communications Support - Made progress on a pre-recorded video presentation about MakerDAO\u2019s emergency response process and roles, to be released in July. MIP 62 Compliance User Notices - Made minor changes to MIP62, and also carried out communication notices for a round of vault offboardings.

Last month we released the third iteration of the dashboard, featuring:  DAO-level activity feed; Improved privacy control and cookie policy; Improved commenting functionality for expense reports; Update reflecting the off-boarded Core Unit status; Preparation for user authentication.  This month, we\u2019ve been focusing on technical features, while continuing to improve data correctness and completeness.  Introducing Dashboard user accounts; Developer Experience improvements; Continued support for Core Unit onboarding and reporting.  Try it out  Visit our dashboard at https://expenses.makerdao.network/  The GraphQL API can be accessed using the API Explorer  Download the latest budget tool here.    MetaDAO and Endgame offsite This month, the SES team have been involved in the 3-day Endgame Plan offsite that took place just before ETHGathering in Barcelona.  Offsite participants discussed the Endgame Plan in-depth, and cleared out some specifics for the various stages of preparation and implementation. We have a better understanding of how SES can support this transition. This includes the evolution of the Ecosystem Performance Dashboard towards a broader coordination tool for MakerDAO operations.   Watch a recap of the offsite here \u00bb   Dashboard Version 0.4 Release Version 0.4 of the dashboard is now available at https://expenses.makerdao.network/. Introducing Dashboard User Accounts Technical feature enabling user authentication, authorization, and account management. The new functionality introduces the basis for future collaboration features in the dashboard:  register an account, authenticate, get authorized to perform certain actions, and manage user profiles.   Introducing dashboard user accounts r41920\u00d71080 54.6 KB  Log-in screen for Site Admins and Core Unit Administrators This feature is a critical prerequisite for Core Unit Administrators and Auditors to collaborate effectively on the dashboard. Note that it is available only for a restricted set of users while we prepare the end-user facing features for coming releases. Improving Developer Experience For developers and data analysts to use the API and the code base more conveniently. Our API and code base are intended as open tools for creating third-party data analysis and UIs, all published under open-source licenses. The improvements in this release help more technical users to better understand API usage, the provided data, and the related code bases. This enables them to contribute to our projects, or create their own projects based on our data and software.   The API Sandbox now has improved documentation about its usage and capabilities; All code repositories can now be found under the SES Github organization  API backend Dashboard UI Budget tool     Improved developer experience r41920\u00d71080 119 KB  Access all code repositories and the API Sandbox via the dashboard footer Onboarding support for the remaining Core Units Since last release, the following Core Units have been onboarded:  Oracles Risk Starknet DECO  This leaves us with only 2 CUs to finish the on-boardings:  Data Insights Collateral Engineering Services  We\u2019ve also continued support to the recently offboarded Core Units in order to include their last months\u2019 expense reports in the Dashboard.   What\u2019s next For the next releases, we aim to put the final pieces in place for correctness and completeness. We will be further working on:  Introducing Auditor Functionality that will offer better insights into Core Units\u2019 expense reporting state, including status, changes, and other relevant information;   Auditor functionality preview for CU Admin view (CU with Auditor)1780\u00d71598 91.2 KB   Improved Developer Experience including more thorough documentation & getting started guides; preparations for dashboard support of the Endgame plan, including Project Based Budgeting and MetaDAOs.

And yet, participants still struggle with the same barriers we set out to remove. That visible struggle indicates that although our goal is essential, we are not producing enough impact. There are several reasons why I believe we have been underperforming. Here are my top 3. Firstly, we are trying to do too much with our small team\u2013everyone\u2019s focus is too split, resulting in slower progress and a lack of quality. Secondly, we haven\u2019t been approaching the information complexity problem correctly. Lastly, we are trying to simultaneously serve too many audiences(MKR holders, Core Units, Delegates, and others), resulting in suboptimal impact. A redesign of GovComms is needed. This month I worked with the team to come to some answers around; What 20% of the programs have 80% of the impact? What isn\u2019t working and probably won\u2019t? What programs will become obsolete? What value does each of our programs provide? What are our strengths, weaknesses, and points of leverage? Who should our primary target audience be?  1600\u00d71108 360 KB  These essential questions are the foundation for understanding how we need to change to produce meaningful impact. My thoughts below are not final; they are being shared as a work-in-progress: Low Impact Programs   Public Relations Support; The simplest of the bunch\u2013we will be cutting this program. Noone in the current team is a PR expert, and we could not get approval for such a hire. We believe it\u2019s best to let Growth and their incubating Brand team take the lead here.  Issue Discussion Call Series; We do not believe this is the best format for helping the community engage with issues. We have paused this program and are considering cutting or improving it. Improvement ideas include calls-by-request, shorter formats, narrower topics, unrecorded sessions, and better-prepared issue research. TBD!  Call Summaries; 75% of our contributor budget is spent on call summaries, so we are keen to tune this program. We need to reassess calls and what level of coverage is appropriate for each.  Communication Platform Stewardship; GovAlpha and our team currently do this. Unfortunately, our team has been overwhelmed, leaving this program at the bottom of our priorities. We continue to provide basic service, but I believe we can do more if we design ourselves some extra bandwidth.  Medium Impact Programs   Stakeholder Content; Information complexity is the primary challenge this program addresses, and it\u2019s barely made a dent. To improve effectiveness, we are trimming existing publications and upgrading our contributor workforce to include a designer(hiring!) and an additional writer. We are also considering a proposal that would position us as the content manager for blog.makerdao.com, though the incubating Brand team might be better for it. TBD!  Communications Audit; We believe SES\u2019s upcoming Ecosystem Dashboard automates a good portion of this audit. We will wait and see whether this program makes sense in the near future.  Stakeholder Database; We believe SES\u2019s upcoming Ecosystem Dashboard is well-positioned to integrate the stakeholder database for more streamlined management. Our team is continuing to pursue the GDPR compliance objective and is considering whether a hand-off in the near future is the wisest move.  Governance & Risk Call Support; Calls themselves are evolving at Maker, so this program is too narrowly defined. We believe a more general \u201cCall Support\u201d program makes sense. This way, we can be flexible and offer the same set of possible services for any call. Call Summaries would be placed within this broader call support program.  High Impact Programs   Initiative Tracking; To foster alignment, we believe creating shared visibility into initiatives will benefit both Delegates and Core Units. It will help Core Units like ours, Growth, and Brand(TBD) to maintain consistency. It will also enable better internal coordination by providing details about initiative leadership, coordination, and progress.  Stakeholder Alignment Framework; We\u2019ve been taking part in this framework as a support team, offering call support in various ways, including acting as call facilitators/initiative coordinators. In our experience, we realized that the most effective initiative coordinators are individuals with subject matter expertise. Therefore it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to facilitate these calls. We believe our role in this framework is to support it with initiative tracking itself, general call support, and focusing more narrowly on reporting initiatives\u2019 status and progress.  Emergency Communications Support; This is a crucial initiative that we believe needs better-dedicated support, but we are not sure what that looks like. Support involves documentation of the emergency response process(98% done), documentation upkeep, education efforts within the DAO, and acting as a communications manager during an emergency or incident. Depending on how drastically we pivot, it might make the most sense for GovAlpha to manage the documentation and education efforts in partnership with the Immunifi Security CU. At the same time, a team with a Public Relations specialization should handle the communications manager role.  Expect to see a mandate refresh coming from us soon. In the meantime, we are continuing to service our active programs while remaining flexible so we can cut/change things as we optimize for impact.  Continued Progress Team members focused on high-priority work items, making progress on Q2 objectives.  920\u00d71600 145 KB  Admin - @Davidutro  Led several internal workshops focused on rethinking GovComms Finalized agreements on new admin costs for accountable & papaya(they took effect starting in May.)  Emergency Comms Support - @Davidutro  Made progress (80% complete) on a slide deck and presentation on the Emergency Response Process & Roles.  Initiatives Tracker & Stakeholder Alignment- @Davidutro  Iterated on a proposal for how Maker should describe and group its initiatives.  Content - @Artem_Gordon  Identified redundancies and least value items within the stakeholder content program. Drafted a MIP60 subproposal for the management of blog.makerdao.com. Dropped the Monthly Governance Review. Conducted design research for stakeholder publications & documented design needs. Began Twitter collaboration with Growth CU  Engagement - @thomas.flitter  Made improvements to the Issue Discussion Call\u2019s procedural documentation, pre-call resources, method of topic selection, and post-call follow-up process. Tried out hosting CMON stakeholder alignment calls. Started introducing select G&R discussion topics. Progress on several policy documents required for Stakeholder Database GDPR compliance.

We will be doing a monthly update rather than a biweekly one with a lighter and higher-level format. Our upcoming quarterly reports will include a more in-depth review. These updates aim to inform DAO stakeholders what our priorities were for the prior month, along with a brief report about our DAO-facing work.   For those who are not yet familiar with the Governance Communications Core Unit, please head out to our transparency dashboard.   April Priorities  Reframing GovComms After a challenging April governance cycle, one of our two budget proposals was approved. We reached out to several stakeholders and delegates to help explain our resource needs and the strategic case for a public relations lead. We realized that many of our key stakeholders have different views and expectations of Govcomms. This lack of clarity around our mandate and its value is something we are focused on fixing. Govcomms faces a few challenges here:  The DAO (ourselves included) is starved for a powerful brand, messaging, and marketing team. We are a communications team, but we do not lead messaging, brand, or marketing. As a field of focus, Organizational Communications is not commonly set up as a stand-alone department, making it hard to understand at a glance. We are closer to an operations team than a marketing team. Organizational comms is an area that involves multiple teams at different levels and so it is challenging to convince people that a dedicated team makes sense (it does.) We are a supporting services team that does not directly drive any revenue. Our programs provide value in hard-to-measure ways that are challenging to craft into a $ saved figure.   Core Unit Overview Presentation (2)960\u00d7540 105 KB  And so, we started work in April to refine the way we articulate our strategy and the way we prove the value of our programs. We\u2019re tackling this on a few fronts:  Weekly Figjam sessions with the team to clarify several aspects of our work.    Challenges we solve Guiding Policies Coherent Actions Strengths Limitations Value of the programs    Revision of our Core Unit Overview Deck. Revision of our Quarterly Update format.   Continued Progress on Objectives April was a month like any other. Team members focused on high priority work items, making progress on Q2 objectives set for each of our programs. Admin - @Davidutro  Lobbied for one of our budgets to get passed. Negotiated better rates for our payroll and accounting service providers, saving the DAO ~10k per year on the payroll side, and more savings to come with a pending proposal from Accountable that offers us a lower monthly rate. Refinement of team vision, strategy, and value proposition. Research and plan for Core Unit restructuring to create less dependency on Accountable.  Content - @Artem_Gordon  Complete and post a Q1 stakeholder content update.  Train and delegate more tasks to our contributors. Continue experimentation with publication format design. Update and improve on publication objectives and challenges. Continue to reduce cost per publication for Weekly Relay and Forum at a Glance.  Engagement - @thomas.flitter  Improvements to the Issue Discussion Call\u2019s procedural documentation, pre-call resources, method of topic selection, and post-call follow-up process. It\u2019s not enough to discuss an issue; we want to drive impact by encouraging the next steps to be carried out when we can. Start to host CMON stakeholder alignment calls. Start to participate in the G&R discussion segment by introducing topics. Progress on completing several policy documents for the Stakeholder Database GDPR compliance. Preparation for and refinement of the upcoming Core Unit Communications Audit.   Emergency Communications Support - @Davidutro  Develop an Emergency Preparedness Workshop which we will run at the end of June. Progress on getting all MakerDAO service owners on a shared pager duty instance. Minor progress on the Emergency Playbook itself.

                    "content": "Authors: @williamr (RWF-001), @eumenes (RWF-001), @teej (RWF-001), @christiancdpetersen (inc. LTS-001) Reviewers: @luca_pro (inc. LOVE-001)   Team The RWF CU is composed of 4x core head counts plus grantees that work on assigned-based projects for their expertise. It partners with other DAO CUs to ensure the end-to-end fullfillment of the collateral onboarding process e.g. CES, Growth. It also works and supports other CUs going through incubation, consistent with the facilitator vision for a decentralised ecosystem for RWAs. Team members:  Will Remor: @williamr  Eric Rapp: @Eumenes  Hugh Ragsdale: @teej  Christian Petersen: @christiancdpetersen  Grantee: Project Finance assignment  Collaborating CU partners and incubatees:  Robert & CES: @monkey.irish  Nadia & Growth team: @nadia  Luca Prosperi (Love): @luca_pro  Christian Petersen (LTS): @christiancdpetersen    Overview During the last months, RWF-001 (or RWF) has worked closely with several potential counterparties that have approached the DAO in order borrow from MakerDAO, or in other words, providers of off-chain collateral to be onboarded. Consistent with the approved MIP67, the relevant stakeholder CU teams are committing to do their best to facilitate the review of each proposal based on the process outlined in the MIP. In doing so, consistent with the collateral onboarding process, the teams involved will necessarily have to prioritise the proposals that Maker has received. In each phase of the collateral onboarding process, the prioritisation will depend on a combination of factors that include, among others:  Current status along the collateral onboarding process Potential financial impact for the protocol Perceived financial and execution risk Level of completion and available details Perceived quality of the counterparty Perceived strategic value in the transaction  It is clear that this prioritisation effort comes necessarily with some level of discretion that all teams involved will endevour to qualify quantitatively and qualitatively in their recommendations. A working group has been formed to evolve the prioritisation framework and reporting to the DAO. As a reminder, according to MIP0, \u201cMIPs are standardised documents subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behaviour of the Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol.\u201d Given the finality of the terms \u201cregulate\u201d and \u201cdefine\u201d, RWF, as well as incubating LTS and LOVE, want to offer the Community a snapshot of what the group intends to be working on.  TL;DR A summary of key activities:   Existing Vault Performance: All vaults continue to perform as obligated. RWF expects, over the next several months, requests for debt ceiling increases from a set of existing vault holders.  A constructive analysis of 6S\u2019 legal stucture was posted on the forum. RWF expects 6S to strengthen its structure such that MakerDAO can responsibly enable 6S to scale with Tesla and other counterparties. New Silver continues to be the largest RWA exposure, with a DC of 20MM and oustanding debt of 14.2MM.    Existing Vault Maintenance: Real World Asset Company (RWAC) and RWF continue to improve reporting for 6S. The community can expect a more intuitive monitoring report shortly. RWF, during the first week of May, has conducted site visits/spot checks for loans in both the 6s and New Silver portfolios. Finally, as a testament to RWF\u2019s and LTS\u2019 insistence on strong infrastructure, Centrifuge have put forth a revised legal structure.  New Proposals: Unless the facts change within May, RWF will prioritize SocGen and Huntingdon Valley Bank this month. LTS will continue to support Centrifuge\u2019s enhancement of its agreements.  New Proposals Guidance: For all new MIPs currently in RFC, RWF will provide a high-level recommendation (to greenlight or not) by five days prior to the greenlight poll end date.   Existing Vaults A summmary of existing vault statuses:     Vault Debt Ceiling Current Exposure Comments     6S 15MM DAI 14,209,499.06  @christianpetersen legal review has been published to the forums. The community should expect good-faith efforts from 6s to improve the structure. RWF visited Tesla location.   Centrifuge New Silver 20MM DAI 16,491,698.44 Performing. RWF expects DC increase request. See AMA w/ Kirill + Alex here.   Centrifuge Consol Freight 2MM DAI 0 Remains undrawn, potential $600K draw for UK COVID tests forthcoming. Also an upcoming high-profile transaction is expected to be announced shortly.   Centrifuge Harbor Trade Credit 7MM DAI 1,069,346.09 Performing. HTC is amidst fundraising and has identified a sizeable TIN investor. Upon this satisfaction of Maker\u2019s first-loss covenant, RWF expects HTC to begin tapping its DAI vault.   Centrifuge FortunaFi 15MM DAI 2,948,604.57 Performing. $500K loan to Dovetail Software paid off, small loss to TIN.     Ongoing Actions for Each Existing Vault 6s (RWA001)  RWF and RWAC, the party responsible for reporting on 6S to the DAO, established a monthly monitoring standard. A monthly project-level and portfolio-level report will be expected within the first 7 working days each month. RWAC published the first of these reports in early April. The next report will include clearer reporting and better user experience. RWAC and RWF have developed a confidentiality-friendly mechanism by which RWF can spot-check progress. This includes secure document sharing as well as site visits. RWF and RWAC continue to improve the reporting pipes and appreciate community feedback. LTS executed a comprehensive legal assessment of the existing 6S structure and posted its concerns. Community feedback is appreciated. Due to the attractiveness of scaling with Tesla and the concomitant DC increase request, we highly recommend that token holders require an improved structure prior to considering any request for additional indebtedness. The objectives will be to increase transparency, implement a \u201ctrust but verify\u201d approach, and ensure Maker\u2019s interests are adequately represented. 6S has MIP72 in RFC that is not in the May cycle.  New Silver (RWA002)  Monitored monthly, NS continues to perform as obligated to. See the March report here. RWF will visit a variety of properties that NS has loaned against in the tri-state area. This will act as a \u201cspot check\u201d for the benefit of token holders. New Silver has recently closed on a $20MM term sheet for mezzanine debt. RWF expects New Silver to request a subsequent expansion of its existing debt ceiling in the future. For insight into how New Silver is navigating changing market conditions and changes it has made to undewriting, see the recent AMA. RWF asked that Kirill + Alex focus specifically on how rising interest rates and higher input pricing (wages, materials) affect the value-add mortgage market.  Consol Freight (RWA003)  ConsolFreight and Centrifuge approached RWF for covenant analysis and approval of a $600K draw. The draw would enable the transport of COVID tests, by ConsolFreight, from China to the UK. The credit is de facto backed by the UK government. As of this publishing, the draw has not yet occurred. If the deal does go through, the community should expect a forum update from Ernesto Vila, co-founder of CF. ConsolFreight has started a pilot partnership with a high-profile global financial services company and a fintech specialised in the agricultural sector. More details of the upcoming transaction will be published by the CF team shortly (@AleG and @EAV).  Harbor Trade Credit (RWA004)  Harbor is actively fundraising on two fronts. The equity capital will be allocated towards technology development with a particular focus on enhancements to the integrated risk management system and trade finance product modules. In parallel, capital is being raised from institutional players to support the growth of the portfolio which will be allocated towards the TIN tranche. Upon satisfaction of Maker\u2019s first loss covenant, the community can expect HTC to begin tapping its DAI vault. Centrifuge will be working with HTC to provide a more in depth update in the coming weeks.  FortunaFi (RWA005)  An obligor prepaid a $500k loan in full. Related Maker DROP was fully repaid as well, with all accrued interest. The loan\u2019s IRR of ~11% was below the 15% target, resulting in a small amount of accrued interest to the NFT being written-off.  Impact is absorbed by the TIN as the 11% return more than covers DROP\u2019s returns (5%).   New Proposals Below, we share a high-level summary of the existing proposals going through the collateral onboading process (MIP6) and MIPs processes. Proposals are listed in priority order, with what the group intends to deliver to the community ahead of the deadline for the next monthly voting cycle. Below example of what we have posted recently For purposes of clarity, the core units will not fully engage external counsel to support on any of these transactions until such time as the MIP or MIP6 (as applicable) is approved. Incubating LTS has identified potential counsel for the HVB transaction (if approved). External counsel for the other transactions will be identified later, as needed.     Priority Name Motivation Status     High SocGen Institutional counterparty, long in the works Implementation   High Huntingdon Valley Bank Rigorous MIP-6 application, regulated US Bank Assessment post greenlight   High Anonymous US Credit Fund Institutional counterparty, 14-year track record MIP6 draft pre-greenlight   Moderate MIP65 Bond Strategy Bond strategy in FS Formal submission   Moderate MIP68 Monetalis SME Green Lending in FS Formal submission   Moderate MIP72 6S Arranger proposal in RFC RFC   Moderate Pando Climate Assets Mid-level MIP-6 application, below market risk pricing MIP6 draft pre-greenlight   Moderate ATDC Egyptian Power Plant Underbaked MIP-6 application, esoteric asset, below market pricing Greenlight polls   Moderate India Power Green Bonds Underbaked MIP-6 application, below market pricing Greenlight polls   Moderate Robinland Mid-level MIP-6 application, start-up manager MIP6 draft pre-greenlight   Low Untangled Start-up manager. Withdrew application. Withdrawn   Low MD Irradiance Withdrew application. Withdrawn     Other applications: RWF CU closely monitors and collaborates with CES in maintaining the collateral status index for off-chain collateral. A number of MIP6 applications were engaged to express their intention to align their submission with the requirements under the MIP67 Methodology. Once we hear from these applicants we will reflect their status in the priority list above. D3M expressions of interest for Maple Finance have also been supported by this group with guidance at the legal and credit level. Further updates on actions taken for these integrations will come in the next monthly update.  Actions for Prioritised Proposals Below, we identify the key actions the teams intend to complete ahead of the next monthly update. 1. MIP6: SocGen  Risk assessment is in motion. Working through technical and legal mechanics in the agreements. See an update fresh off the press here.  2. MIP6: Huntingdon Valley Bank  Greenlight poll was unanimously passed this week. RWF to conduct risk assessment and finalize the term sheet in the coming weeks.  @teej has toured a portfolio of Pennsylvania-based assets to understand how HVB thinks about geographic concentration, portfolio construction, and underwriting transitional vs. stabilized RE assets LTS has enlisted external counsel to review legal agreements such as master purchase agreement and participation agreements LTS is developing enhancements to the Delaware Statutory Trust Agreeement used in 6S for application in HVB RWF has identified a slate of institutional service providers to serve the verification agent and trustee functions. In-person read-through of documents scheduled among RWF, RWAC, and HVB for late May Deal schedule with milestones, deliverables, and timing drafted  3. Anonymous US Credit Fund  Working out indicative terms for a large credit facility, asset and cash-flow backed. Potential deal will be facilitated/arranged by a party similar in function to RWAC (arranger for HVB). RWF has received a counter-offer to its proposed terms from key decision makers. RWF is awaiting data room access in order to run the senstivity analyses necessary to structure covenants. Assuming a meeting of the minds occurs, Maker token holders can expect a signal request from the arranger which will seek to measure community sentiment. The proposed DC quantum is nine figures. MIP6 is expected to follow, now in draft  4. Oasis Pro Markets: ATDC Egyptian Power Plant  Green-light poll initiated on May 2nd. LTS has provided high-level comments to application RWF has provided a high-level recommendation prior to greenlight end.  The OPM onboarding call contains meaningful dialogue between RWF and OPM regarding the defensibility of the application as-is.  5. Oasis Pro Markets: India Green Power Bonds  Green-light poll initiated on May 2. LTS has provided high-level comments to application RWF has provided a high-level recommendation prior to greenlight end.  The OPM onboarding call contains meaningful dialogue between RWF and OPM regarding the defensibility of the application as-is.  6. Robinland  Green-light passed. RWF in talks with Robinland to restructure and professionalize MIP-6 as per MIP67. First draft of updated MIP6 by Robinland in review.  7. Untangled  Commercial risk evaluation completed as of November 2021 RWF, LTS, and CES provided recommendation regarding vault proceedings Untangled withdrew its application   What Else Consistent with its mandate and with the process proposed through the approved MIP67, the group continues to support counterparties that have an off-chain vault active, as well as those counterparties that have been greenlit and that are requesting counselling in order to prepare the best possible MIP to be presented to the community. In addition, the group remains available to be consulted by any other counterparty that intends to understand more about Maker\u2019s stance with regards to real-world assets, as well as the onboarding process as a whole. Although what described above doesn\u2019t intend to be exhaustive of what the teams have been working on, we hope we have provided the community a good sense of what to expect in the upcoming month. We remain available for discussion, on forums, discord and during RWF\u2019s weekly office hours.

                    "content": " Thanks for reading the monthly update of the DUX (Development & UX) Core Unit! These updates serve as a vehicle for transparency with regards to our work and focus. We aim to stick to the format suggested by @Artem_Gordon of @gov-comms-core-unit. In addition to these lower-timeframe updates we do quarterly roadmap updates on the Forum. Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr Last month we have made steady progress on some of our larger roadmap items (eg. gasless poll voting), contributed/explored cross-core unit initiatives (eg. cross-CU design alignment) and made some time investments in work that will bear fruit further down the road (eg. budget refresh MIP).   Product updates We deployed one major update to the Governance Portal last month. In parallel we\u2019ve been working on future updates on separate branches\u2014see the Research & Development section below.  Governance Portal updates On August 22nd we released an update which enabled a new governance primitive; Approval Voting polls. This feature was requested by GovAlpha and leveraged our previous work on a composable system for governance metadata. In addition the release contained optimisations to caching, an improvement to documentation (useful when trying to fork the Governance Portal) and smaller improvements and fixes.  Research & Development  We are currently working on a development branch that upgrades some key libraries, which also enabled us to implement native support for (Gnosis) Safe multisigs. We are still testing this branch but are aiming to release it sometime in the 1st half of September.  In the 2nd half of August our team started focussing solely on the release of gasless poll voting. The remaining integration work is now clear and broken down, the design is being actively iterated on, and TechOps is involved in setting up tests & monitoring for the components. We are comfortable committing to a release by the very end of September.   To clarify, users won\u2019t be forced to adopt the new gasless poll voting system\u2014voting on Ethereum mainnet will remain a possibility. Gasless poll voting will be opt-out, the code will be open-source, the system will be documented, and there will be features for users to verify whether their votes have been recorded correctly.    Team updates  Submitting a CU budget renewal MIP Our Core Unit\u2019s budget is expiring by the end of January 2023 and therefore we have prepared a budget MIP to renew our budget by an additional 12 months. The proposal is written in recognition of today\u2019s bearish market context and the DAO\u2019s intent to cut costs. In this proposal we provide two distinct budget options that both represent a significant (>10%) bottom-line budget reduction for our Core Unit without impairing execution of our mandate. We collectively decided to not include any raises or bonuses in this budget proposal.  Decentralized Operations working group Over the past few months the facilitators of DUX, SES, GovComms and GovAlpha have been exploring a more intense mode of collaboration, which resulted in the Decentralized Operations initiative between these four operational Core Units. In August we have coordinated async and conducted two workshops as a means to find alignment on the initiative\u2019s purpose and scope, as well as mapping out the organization. Once ready we will publicly announce the initiative.  Design Alignment workshops Together with @Lenkla and @wouter from SES CU we have been working on an initiative that aims to bring together UX/UI designers within MakerDAO and facilitate cross-CU collaboration as a means to create a more harmonized design throughout Maker\u2019s frontends and brand assets. After some weeks of preparation and initial outreach we finally got to facilitate two workshops in August in which we explored the various visual styles, design patterns and frontends out there, as well as discussed an initial scope for the initiative. The working group will share a public update later on\u2014for now we\u2019ll continue working under-the-radar.  SES budget tool onboarding In August our Core Unit got onboarded to the Expenses Dashboard, built by SES CU. This dashboard will be part of a larger Transparency Dashboard and can be used by anyone to find information about Core Units and their monthly financial forecasts & expenses. We\u2019re excited to be one of the first teams to be onboarded, and we\u2019re bullish on the further usage of software and frontends to solve the information cost problem at MakerDAO.  Workshop: Governance Learning Forum 2022 In August our @0xdeniz participated in an online event called Governance Learning Forum 2022 , organized by Orca Protocol (recently rebranded to Metropolis ) and Other Internet. The two-day event had over 100 DAO governance thinkers & doers participating, and was centered around relevant lectures and ensuing discussions within smaller working groups. MakerDAO ended up being a focus in various working groups. Read more in this dedicated forum post.  Team holidays Just a repeated notice that some DUX team members are taking 2-3 weeks of holidays in the months of July/August/September. In our holiday planning we\u2019ve made sure there are always enough people available to continue work on our roadmap and respond to emergencies.

Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr Despite July being a bit of a holiday month (with nearly half of the dev team taking some time off), it\u2019s been an effective month for DUX. Last month we focussed on facilitating the delegate contract migration through delivering an update to the Governance Portal and coordinating with GovAlpha CU, GovComms CU, Growth CU, and individual recognized delegates. In parallel we\u2019ve been making steady progress on the gasless poll voting system. We have also started a maintenance sprint to make further optimisations to the Governance Portal to make it more efficient and stable in light of the recent uptick in governance activity. In addition; Deniz continued work on the \u2018Improving Collaboration Infrastructure\u2019 initiative(LINK), which holds three sub-initiatives.  Lastly, we ran a team retrospective to define some improvement areas and create a safe space for sharing feedback.   Product updates We deployed one major update to the Governance Portal last month. In parallel we\u2019ve been working on future updates on separate branches\u2014see the Research & Development section below.  Governance Portal updates On July 14th we released an update which was focussed on the delegate migration. It featured a new flow for recognized delegates, enabling them to securely migrate to a new delegate contract in case of expiry. It also enabled delegators to easily find and delegate any MKR delegated to expiring/expired delegate contracts. The full release notes for this update can be found here.   Although we\u2019ve worked hard to optimise the UX on the app layer, migrating still requires multiple on-chain transactions\u2014click here to learn why this is still necessary.   Research & Development  In July we\u2019ve started a maintenance sprint to continue our work on making the Governance Portal more efficient and stable in light of the recent uptick in governance activity. A few weeks ago we started researching ways to increase efficiency by reducing the load on external data sources such as our rpc endpoint provider. After successfully implementing some of these ideas we were able to significantly increase efficiency, which makes for a more stable application but also lower software expenses for our team. We still have a lot of maintenance work in progress of which the fruits will be shared in future updates, likely in the 2nd half of August.  Although most of the team has been focussed on the work related to facilitating the delegate migration, our engineers Tyler and Philip have been working on progressing the gasless poll voting system that is slated for release by the end of this quarter. We\u2019ve forked spock and gov-polling-db onto a separate VM for ease of iterating, and implemented changes to enable fetching and storing vote events from Arbitrum. In addition, we\u2019ve done work in light of the Arbitrum migration from Rinkeby to G\u00f6rli (which broke some components, such as the OpenZeppelin Relayer). Lastly, we\u2019ve progressed on designing the UX design for gasless poll voting.   To clarify, users won\u2019t be forced to adopt the new gasless poll voting system\u2014voting on Ethereum mainnet will remain a possibility. Gasless poll voting will be opt-out, the code will be open-source, the system will be documented, and there will be additional features for users to verify whether their votes have been recorded correctly.    Team updates  Submitting a workshop for devcon VI in Colombia We submitted a proposal to the Devcon team for organizing a workshop at their Devcon conference in Colombia  later this year. After a successful contribution to Devconnect (a week-long conference in Amsterdam, organised by the Ethereum Foundation) we\u2019re happy to share that our proposal was approved! We\u2019ll start preparing for the workshop later this quarter and share more info soon. All six DUX team members will be in Colombia for our second and last team offsite of the year. We absolutely cannot wait to meet again in person\u2014it\u2019s long overdue\u2026   Coordinate with stakeholders for delegate migration In addition to deploying the Governance Portal update including the delegate migration update, we also closely collaborated with delegates, GovAlpha, GovComms and Growth CU to orchestrate the migration of expired delegate contracts. We\u2019ve provided personal assistance to delegates during their migration, worked on MakerDAO-wide comms (thanks to @Davidutro for the help), wrote an entry for the Operational Manual, reached out to notable delegators (shoutout to @GovAlpha-Core-Unit for the help), and coordinated with crypto custodians to make sure their institutional delegators were informed of the need for migration and supplied with the relevant information.  \u2018Improving collaboration infrastructure\u2019 initiative progress update In addition to working towards the DUX mandate, @0xdeniz has been progressing on his \u2018improving collaboration infrastructure\u2019 initiative, which covers three sub-initiatives. 1. Organizing a debating course for delegates The small course was concluded and saw an average participation from ~15 individuals in total (recognized delegates and core unit members who have been engaged in governance discussions lately). A document was made to summarize a debating format that could work well for MakerDAO, and Deniz is coordinating with some participants on how to best follow-up. 2. Organizing a creative facilitation course for CU facilitators The course started in July and will take four weeks in total. 18 individuals (spread out over 11 Core Units and one delegate) are participating and collectively co-funded the initiative which required an investment of ~10k USD. Course outcome will be reported on once completed. 3. Organizing an initiative to explore ways to make MakerDAO calls more effective Deniz and @Davidutro conducted two workshops with 9 participants (CU members and recognized delegates) to define the most important challenges and needs related to calls, and defined ideas for improvements. The output was consolidated in a document and is currently being iterated on before being brought to the wider community.  Negotiating better software rates In light of the ongoing efforts to reduce the DAOs operational spend, we\u2019ve been working towards making our application more efficient but also revise our software spending and vendor contracts. Our main software expense has been Alchemy\u2014an RPC endpoint provider. Over the course of weeks we\u2019ve successfully negotiated better rates and more flexibility through a revised vendor contract. This will result in lower and more predictable software expenses from August onwards, and a reaffirmed collaboration with the Alchemy team. They\u2019ve been great.  Team holidays Just a repeated notice that some DUX team members are taking 2-3 weeks of holidays in the months of July/August/September. In our holiday planning we\u2019ve made sure there are always enough people available to continue work on our roadmap and respond to emergencies.

We aim to stick to the format suggested by @Artem_Gordon of @gov-comms-core-unit. In addition to these lower-timeframe updates we do quarterly roadmap updates on the Forum. Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr In November we shipped our biggest update yet (Gasless Poll Voting), shifted focus onto a new development project as part of the Endgame implementation efforts, contributed to an offsite and conference. Lastly, our budget renewal got approved.   Product updates  Governance Portal In November we launched a Gasless Poll Voting system, built on top of the existing voting infrastructure of MakerDAO. This was a major update which required lots of QA work and manual testing. After launching on November 10th we haven\u2019t seen any major issues with the deployment and we\u2019ve seen steady usage by the community (), which makes us proud. As our confidence in the system grew we incrementally took down redundant infrastructure that we set up earlier as fallback option.  image969\u00d71124 122 KB    Try out the gasless poll voting system on the Governance Portal! More info about the system and its design can be found in its MakerDAO Operational Manual entry.   New project: MetaDAO app Over the past few months the DUX team has been exploring ways to contribute to the implementation of the Endgame plan, and got involved in the work related to interfaces/frontends. We proactively decided to take on the MetaDAO app/frontend project which is one of the Pregame products. In October we spent time on defining and understanding the requirements for this application, upon which we started technical research and exploring UI/UX design. We are currently working towards milestone sessions with MetaDAO stakeholders later this month, focussed on fundamental design decisions related to technical architecture and UI/UX design.  The future of the Governance Portal Although our focus is shifting towards the MetaDAO app project, we will continue to monitor & maintain the Governance Portal as it\u2019s still crucial infrastructure of MakerDAO. Last month we took time to define improvements & optimisations to the Governance Portal that it requires in order to reach \u2018maintenance mode\u2019\u2014a stable state which requires little effort to keep running, even when facing an ever-increasing number of delegates, polls and executives. We are currently planning execution of this work.   Team updates  Budget renewal approved Last month our Core Unit\u2019s budget renewal got approved. This is not something we take for granted given the ongoing changes to the DAO and the bearish market conditions. We are thankful for the opportunity and proud of the vote of confidence we\u2019ve received from delegates & MKR holders. We will do our best over the next 12 months to make our contributions to the Endgame execution a success, and we will strive to remain useful and relevant in the Maker ecosystem as it evolves over time.  MetaRetreat participation Last month @0xdeniz participated in an offsite focussed on MetaDAOs, attended by a handful of stakeholders who will be crucial in the launch of the first MetaDAOs and their related processes. The focus was to create a common understanding of the most important mechanisms of Endgame, and figure out the first steps towards execution.  Contribution to ETHGathering Last month @0xdeniz attended the ETHGathering conference in Barcelona, organized by @tadeo. As part of the conference @0xdeniz co-organized a MakerDAO-only session focussed on \u2018unfuzzing\u2019 the endgame plan and its short-term execution steps. Although the session turned out different from its original design, it ended up being attended by many contributors to MakerDAO and useful to most. @flipflopflapdelegate recorded some key plenary moments\u2014the resulting recording will be useful to those trying to understand the Endgame proposal and its execution. On request and following the lead of other attending faciliators, DUX team decided to put in a 2000 DAI sponsorshop to ETHGathering.  December holidays The DUX team will be on leave between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, spending time with family & friends. Similar to last year, we will take measures to make sure the Governance Portal and related infra are being monitored, with developers on stand-by to respond to any emergencies.

Further reducing the costs of voting diminishes the friction placed on prospective delegates, especially in the Ethereum ecosystem. We hope this can be a model for other DAOs & reduces the barrier to entry for voters. I am glad to see your team\u2019s commitment to taking a break and refreshing. Enjoy it - I will be too. Upon visiting the Governance Portal - it takes a bit to populate delegate amounts  and register settings (Dark Mode) Is this a local problem, or a result of more load on the site (new delegates, new features)?

Appreciate you taking the effort to write us here  With regards to loading times of certain elements in the Governance Portal; we are aware of this. Calculating datapoints related to delegation (for example) put quite a strain on resources due to how Maker\u2019s on-chain governance system works\u2014these datapoints cannot be fetched from the blockchain directly but require indexing. Earlier this year we implemented a granular/modular caching layer in order to decouple resource usage from website traffic & MakerDAO governance complexity, but when visiting the Governance Portal for the first time some datapoints and lists will take some time to load.

Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr In September we were fully focussed on finishing the work on gasless poll voting\u2014we finished implementation but decided to defer launch until after our offsite, until the third week of October. This update includes a video preview for those who can\u2019t wait  We also released one update to the Governance Portal, have been exploring the future of MakerDAO and ways we can contribute, and we have been preparing our second offsite of the year which will be centered around the devcon conference.   Product updates We deployed one major update to the Governance Portal last month. In parallel we\u2019ve been finishing up the gasless poll voting feature.  Governance Portal update On September 12th we released an update which makes for a decent UX improvement with regards to wallet connections. Connecting your wallet to the Governance Portal should now be easier and more reliable, as well as switching wallets. We also added native support for (Gnosis) Safe multisigs!  Research & Development  In September our team finished implementing the long-awaited gasless poll voting feature. We decided to postpone the actual launch until after our team offsite, which starts this week and lasts for two weeks. The reason is that we want to be available in case any unforeseen accidents occur during or after launch, which would require intervention or a rollback. We\u2019ve been collaborating with the TechOps team to coordinate thorough testing, drafting a rollback plan and preparing for launch. We expect to launch the feature in the third week of October. For those who can\u2019t wait; here\u2019s a recording of the gasless poll voting system in action!      To clarify, users won\u2019t be forced to adopt the new gasless poll voting system\u2014voting on Ethereum mainnet will remain a possibility. Gasless poll voting is opt-out, the code will be open-source, the system will be documented, and there will be features for users to verify whether their votes have been recorded correctly.    Team updates  Submitting a CU budget renewal MIP We recently submitted a core unit budget MIP as our current budget is expiring early next year. The proposal is written in recognition of today\u2019s bearish market context and the DAO\u2019s intent to cut costs. In this proposal we provide two distinct budget options that both represent a significant (>10%) bottom-line budget reduction for our Core Unit without impairing execution of our mandate. We collectively decided to not include any raises or bonuses in this budget proposal. Find the MIP here and feel free to reach out in case of questions or feedback.  Workshop: DAO Governance Design Jam @ devcon VI Our submission was accepted by the Ethereum Foundation team, therefore we will be organizing a short (<2h) workshop focussed on pressing governance challenges in the DAO space. We\u2019ve invited DAO governance thinkers & doers from the wider web3 space, and selected a few challenge owners upfront so groups can jam on solutions. Readers are very welcome to join the workshop!   When? October 11th, 3:30pm local time  Where? Devcon Bogota , \u2018Workshop 3\u2019 room  How? Make sure you have a devcon ticket, and just show up in time!   Preparing for the future Over the past weeks we\u2019ve been exploring future scenarios for MakerDAO based on the ongoing governance discussions (including but not limited to Rune\u2019s Endgame vision). We would love to talk to community members (eg. delegates, workforce members) to discuss the future of the DUX team! Feel free to reach out to @0xdeniz in case you want to chat.  Team offsite This week we\u2019re starting our 2nd team offsite of the year. That\u2019s right, the DUX team haven\u2019t been together since March! We\u2019re travelling to Colombia for the devcon conference and we can\u2019t wait to hang around together and meet fellow MakerDAO community members. Reach out if you want to meet!

November Priorities Advocate for our Budget Proposal & Plotting for Endgame Copyright License Implementations and Ownership Current Events Research Papers Publication Improvements Call Support  Advocating for our Budget Proposal & Plotting for Endgame We advocated for our proposed six-month budget by engaging with voters and writing a statement of intention regarding our future as it relates to EndGame. Our proposal was rejected, with several voters recommending we regroup as an independent Ecosystem Actor or by merging with GovAlpha. At this early stage of Endgame, work supporting coordination and information accessibility is crucial. This formative season will see new stakeholder groups, processes, and needs emerging as the rules of engagement get formalized. We are sad at the outcome of the vote and are interested to see what the support of EndGame\u2019s initial process and logistics will look like. We are grateful for the opportunity we\u2019ve been given this last year and a half.  Copyright License Implementations and Ownership We worked with the Dai Foundation to help safeguard the intangible assets we produce, making them common goods for the MakerDAO ecosystem. We put licenses in place where they needed to be and initiated the transfer of their ownership to the Dai Foundation. This work will be finalized in December.

                    "content": " Expenses Dashboard monthly update: September 2022 Thanks for reading the monthly update of the MakerDAO Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard by the SES Core Unit! Following our first soft release, these monthly updates will provide you with the progress of our continuous work, including new features, bug fixes, and other relevant information per each new iteration. We\u2019re happy to answer your questions here, on our SES Discord server, or SES CU channel in the MakerDAO Discord.   Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard Release #2 (October 4th)   Tl;dr  Visit our dashboard at https://expenses.makerdao.network/.  Download the latest budget tool here.  Last month we launched the first version of the dashboard. In our previous release, the product featured:  a comprehensive overview of all the MakerDAO Core Units; functionality for all Core Unit Administrators to easily submit their monthly budget reports; and the ability for MakerDAO stakeholders to review monthly budget reports in a single place.  This month, we are pleased to announce the following improvements:  a change tracking feature to quickly distinguish the latest CU budget updates; functionality to provide additional comments to budget line items; Core Unit GitHub links for quick access to technical CU work; navigation and UX improvements; sorting and filtering for mobile view; and an update on the onboarding of remaining CUs.    Introducing Change Tracking: easily identify the latest CU budget updates Displaying the current data in the UI alone has limited effect without providing a broader context. This is where the new feature, Change Tracking comes in - enhancing the experience for auditors and other MakerDAO stakeholders with an ability to track what has changed since their last visit. The following elements help users understand the changes to the dashboard data:  Core Unit Activity Feed page (new): get an overview of specific Core Unit activity feed in a single place together with an indication in the activity feed so that you can see what changed since your last visit. Last modified column in the CU overview table: see when was the CU data last changed in this global view (or sort by the latest CU updates). Budget statement last update indicator in the CU Finances page: understand when the Core Unit budget statement was last updated.   Change tracking feature for Core Units https://imgur.com/d7eOHFY1920\u00d71080 88 KB   Introducing Comments: understand budget statements at a deeper level Incorporating the user feedback from Core Unit Administrators, we wanted to provide them with the ability to offer additional context to the specific expense items in their reports. Commenting feature enables them to add notes to individual line items in their Budget Statement Actuals to explain what the expense is for or why it differs from the forecast when deemed useful.  comments release 0.21920\u00d71080 77.5 KB   New GitHub links for technical Core Units: for quick access to their work While the dashboard already displayed various social media links for the Core Units, GitHub was still missing. We have now added the GitHub links for 9 technical Core Units.  Navigation improvements: access alternative data whenever possible Integrating our dashboard with other Ecosystem websites is another way to provide the most relevant information to the user without reimplementing existing functionality. In this iteration, we added links to the makerburn.com page for each Core Unit, with their on-chain transactions.  An example of improved navigation https://imgur.com/FnJR54E1920\u00d71080 70.7 KB   UX improvements: making data and rich text readability more delightful Another improvement to the dashboard has been enhancing the readability of the information by tweaks in the typography and spacing for desktop and responsive views alike. We\u2019d also like to mention another mobile UX enhancement - the ability to both sort and filter the Core Units.  better mobile ux release 0.21920\u00d71080 91 KB   Onboarding remaining Core Units While we laid out the infrastructure for Core Unit Administrators in the first release, we engaged only a handful of early users. This iteration was focused on onboarding the rest - making sure that all CUs are familiar with the process and can make their budget data available on a monthly basis. From the original 6 CUs, we are in contact with the remaining 14 Core Units and are in various stages of supporting them towards pushing their first reports. Data is already available in the dashboard for:   Strategic Finance,  Real-World Finance,  Strategic Happiness,  Protocol Engineering,  Growth,  Sidestream, and GovAlpha Core Units.  And more is to come in the following days.  What\u2019s next For the coming releases, we will continue to focus on improving data correctness and completeness, as well as adding new features and improvements. A few changes that are already in the pipeline:  Global activity feed page to complement the Core Unit activity feeds; Further improved commenting functionality for expense reports; Wrapping up remaining CU onboarding.    Additional insights from the API As mentioned before, the data insights do not have to be limited to the views of the dashboard frontend.

Following our first soft release, these monthly updates will provide you with the progress of our continuous work, including new features, bug fixes, and other relevant information per each new iteration. We\u2019re happy to answer your questions here, on our SES Discord server, or SES CU channel in the MakerDAO Discord.   Ecosystem Performance API & Dashboard Release #3 (November 3rd)  Tl;dr  Next to our team offsite and participation at Devcon Bogota, the team prepared a new release of the Ecosystem API and Dashboard, as well as the Core Unit Budget Tool.  Visit our dashboard at https://expenses.makerdao.network/  The GraphQL API can be accessed using the API explorer  Download the latest budget tool here   Last month we released the second iteration of the dashboard, featuring:  a change tracking feature to quickly distinguish the latest CU budget updates; functionality to provide additional comments to budget line items; Core Unit GitHub links for quick access to technical CU work; navigation and UX improvements, sorting and filtering for mobile view, and an update on the onboarding of remaining CUs.  This month, we are pleased to announce the following improvements:  DAO-level activity feed; improved privacy control and cookie policy; improved commenting functionality for expense reports; update reflecting the off-boarded Core Unit status; preparation for user authentication.    SES in Bogota: team offsite and Devcon VI attendance The SES team met in Bogota for another strategic offsite, where we discussed and planned the most important topics and challenges that we\u2019ve set to tackle in the coming months. We have covered the Endgame and MetaDAO plans, business model canvas for Decentralized Operations, retrospective and planning for the future Dashboard product iterations, and much more. With several other Core Units present, we have managed to collaborate on some of these bigger plans and sync up IRL on other DAO matters. Our team could not miss out on the most important community event, Devcon. Besides great conversations, our experts on sustainable DAO scaling have contributed as speakers. Catch up on the SES Devcon talks:   @Lenkla and her People Ops Guild held a workshop Buidl the buidlers. This is were a lot of insights gained from the X-Ray research could be applied by the orgs in the broader ecosystem - building the next web3 builders.   @wouter gave a talk The history and future of decentralized operations at MakerDAO, where he outlined our history, evolution of decentralized operations and governance. He shared insights into some of the most prominent scaling challenges at Maker and the solutions that SES is contributing to:  Stakeholder alignment & political deadlock \u2192 Decentralized Voter Committees Broken transparency & breakdown of trust \u2192 Decentralized Operations Platform Coordination failure between Core Units \u2192 Project Based Budgeting Talent Acquisition, Onboarding and Compensation \u2192 Maker Academy as a replacement of our Incubation Program.           @juan moderated the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling panel to explore different ways to drive community growth within a decentralized organization.   @layerzero joined the DAOist event to talk about Decentralizing Legal Operations.     Dashboard Version 0.3 Release Version 0.3 of the dashboard is now available at https://expenses.makerdao.network/.  DAO-level Activity Feed A global activity feed with everything that\u2019s happening on the platform, with the possibility to filter by the Core Units of interest. Previously we introduced activity feeds for individual Core Units. Building on this functionality for auditors and other MakerDAO stakeholders, we are now offering an aggregated DAO-wide overview of the changes that occurred with all Core Unit activity in one place. The global activity feed allows you to:  See all dashboard activity that happened across the DAO; See what changed since your last visit; Filter by Core Unit to see only the information that is relevant to you.   DAO level activity feed1920\u00d71080 83.9 KB  Many more activity types reflecting future functionality will be added in later releases. Think of this as the MakerDAO firehose, similar to Twitter, where users will be able to subscribe to the types of activities that are of interest to them.  Improved Privacy Control Cookie settings and policy page Allow the user to choose if cookies can be used for remembering the dark mode toggle, last visit indicators, and basic feature usage tracking. Publication of the cookie policy that lays out these purposes.  Improved Commenting for Expense Reports Get additional context for the monthly Core Unit expenses. After we introduced budget line item comments specific to the monthly wallet breakdowns, we wanted to provide Core Unit Administrators with a more general tool to better explain their expense reports. The general comments feature for the monthly expense report enables Core Unit Administrators to provide the necessary context for their expenses. This will be further extended in later releases with auditing and review functionality.  improved comments1920\u00d71080 79.8 KB   Offboarded Core Units Understand which Core Units were recently offboarded. With the recently voted in changes to offboard several MakerDAO Core Units, we have further specified these changes in the dashboard by introducing \u201cobsolete\u201d status for such Core Units. This small yet powerful refinement helps MakerDAO stakeholders to better understand the current state of the DAO.  offboarded core units1920\u00d71080 78.8 KB   Under the hood Preparing for user authentication. We are also working on the ability for users to authenticate on the dashboard. Authentication is a critical requirement for future collaboration features. Note that this functionality is not yet available on the live platform.  sneak peek user authentication1920\u00d71080 62.1 KB  The first iteration we are working on, is also a prerequisite for future web3 authentication.   What\u2019s next For the next release, we\u2019re putting the final pieces in place to improve data correctness, completeness, and availability:  Finishing user authentication for Core Unit Administrators and Auditors.

                    "content": " Thanks for reading the monthly update of the DUX (Development & UX) Core Unit! These updates serve as a vehicle for transparency with regards to our work and focus. We aim to stick to the format suggested by @Artem_Gordon of @gov-comms-core-unit. In addition to these lower-timeframe updates we do quarterly roadmap updates on the Forum. Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr Last month we had our second offsite of this year, centered around the devcon VI conference in Colombia!  The offsite was mostly dedicated to interpreting the Endgame MIPs and positioning ourselves to be able to contribute to its execution. In the short-term we are commited to taking on one of the Endgame pregame products; the MetaDAO frontend. We also ran into some unfortunate issues with Gasless Poll Voting QA/testing, which forced us to delay the launch. We are now finally gearing up for launch next week.   Product updates  Governance Portal We did not deploy any updates to the Governance Portal in October, although we have been working on  Gasless Poll Voting. Although the code has been ready since the end of September we spent more time debugging edge cases, writing tests and performing stress tests of the system. We are aiming for launch next week.   For those who missed last month\u2019s CU update; here\u2019s a recording of the gasless poll voting system in action!  In addition, we are preparing ourselves to switch focus away from the Governance Portal and towards Endgame projects. We have defined a shortlist of improvements that will contribute to the robustness of the Governance Portal, facing an ever-growing number of executives, polls, votes, and delegates. Lastly, we are exploring the necessary changes to the Governance Portal that Maker Core governance in Early Game will require. Besides these behind-the-scenes improvements we likely will not prioritise further development of new features for the Governance Portal, as a means to free up capacity to contribute to Endgame. We will however continue monitoring & maintaining the Governance Portal codebase, making sure this critical piece of infrastructure continues to run well and meets the demands of Maker Core governance.  MetaDAO frontend As mentioned before, the DUX team has committed to developing one of the Endgame pregame products; the MetaDAO frontend. This application is a prerequisite to launching the first set of MetaDAOs and reaching the Early Game phase of Endgame. Creating this application is a unique engineering & design challenge because of its unique requirements. The application needs to be highly resilient and therefore cannot be built on web2 infrastructure. @0xdeniz has been conducting workshops with @rune and @wouter  to explore and gather the requirements, and next week the whole DUX team will start focussing on this project. Expect more updates in the near future as we progress!  Proof-of-Concept for GovAlpha We have been collaborating with GovAlpha CU to develop a Proof-of-Concept and design wireframes for a new concept they have been working on and will be proposed to the community at a later point.   Team updates  Devcon VI conference attendance & workshop We attended the Devcon VI conference in Colombia, which served as our second offsite of the year. We had a great deal of fun, met up with lots of MakerDAO workforce people and also Maker delegates. We ended up spending a lot of time talking about Endgame implementation and workforce clustering, which helped us in our own sense-making and positioning process. In addition @tiago and @0xdeniz hosted a workshop as part of the Devcon conference. The DAO Governance Design Jam was a public workshop where four preselected DAO governance problems were in focus for ideation. We ended up with a full room (~120 people) and a high engagement. The group size made it messy, but it was fun and it got the challenge owners some fresh insights and/or ideas. The recording can be found on the Devcon archive website here.  Team offsite The week before Devcon in Bogota (Colombia) we spent 5 days together as a team. We hadn\u2019t been together since March this year, so an offsite was long overdue. We spent a lot of time workshopping on Endgame understanding & scenario mapping, and had lots of personal conversations that will inform the path we end up taking as MakerDAO evolves away from the Core Unit model. In addition we had fun together and reminded ourselves that we\u2019re indeed a team of real people   Core Unit budget renewal We formally submitted our core unit budget renewal MIP for the November governance cycle. Our current budget is expiring early next year and we intend to stick around a bit longer in order to help make Endgame early game happen  The proposal is written in recognition of today\u2019s bearish market context and the DAO\u2019s intent to cut costs. In this proposal we provide two distinct budget options that both represent a significant (>10%) bottom-line budget reduction for our Core Unit without impairing execution of our mandate. We collectively decided to not include any raises or bonuses in this budget proposal. Find the MIP here   Questions or comments based on this update?

The Governance Communications Core Unit is responsible for several programs that focus on stakeholder coordination and informational accessibility.  July Priorities  GovComms Redesign We took a step back from solidifying anything in the redesign in anticipation of the DAO Ops working group being formed between SES, DUX, GOV, and ourselves. Group workshops are being planned for August. Our current program design draft:  image1551\u00d7697 70.9 KB   Tuning Content for Noise Reduction & Delegate Needs As part of the narrowed focus on Delegates as our key audience, the following changes were made:   State of DAI has been discontinued because it does not provide delegates with valuable information or resources. Weekly activity on MKR, DAI, and Vault activity can be found on the Risk Dashboard.    Forum at a Glance now contains shorter post summaries, reducing noise and redundancy.  The Monthly Core Unit Updates publications are now posted as live threads. They go up on the first day of each month and will be regularly updated until the end of that month. All call summaries are now produced in editorial style. Semi-transcription summaries are only available through direct request.    @Recognized-Delegates, please fill out this <5 minute questionnaire to help us identify and improve on delegate needs.   Improving Design We\u2019ve hired a design contributor to help us improve the visual experience that govcomms outputs. Good design has many benefits; It reduces noise, utilizes visual imagery, and leads to better absorption of information. Our initial work involves creating a design language that complements the Maker brand. To start, we are creating several slide deck templates the DAO can use. We are also beginning to build a design asset library.  Communications Audit July was spent completing the audit and initial written report. Looking ahead to August, the next step is to share findings and collect feedback with each Core Unit Facilitator. If facilitators agree with the findings, then the next step will be to finalize the audit and set a timetable for completing each recommendation. @thomas.flitter will be putting together a video overview to complement the incoming report.  Call Support & Improvements Governance and Risk Support: Agenda coordination, weekly forum thread, Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, calendar support, and slide deck. Changes: Changed discussion topic types to be rooted in RFC or Formally Submitted proposals. Experimented with a later call time for DAO participants in the eastern world (we are not doing it again, it doesn\u2019t make much sense.) CMON, CMOFF, & SEC Stakeholder Alignment Calls Support: Facilitation, agenda coordination, Zoom hosting, recording, attendance tracking, calendar support, and async work around initiative management. Changes: Changed the cadence of these calls to once per month with space for breakout sessions. Took back responsibility for CMOFF call facilitation from SES. CSI Update Call Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, attendance tracking. Changes: None. Rune\u2019s DVC / Endgame Calls Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, attendance tracking, and calendar support. Changes: None. Delegate Office Hours Support: Provide weekly forum thread with topic-discussion poll, Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, and calendar support. Changes: None. Mandated Actors Support: Minimal, we are part of the discussion regarding the purpose of the call. Changes: Removed GnR coordination to be async.  Other Admin - @Davidutro Worked with SF & AccountAble to explore our payroll service provider\u2019s deposit requirement. It effectively ties up capital that was earmarked for other things. Thankfully our contingency buffer prevents this from affecting our operations. THANKS MAKERDAO! Engagement - @thomas.flitter Going back and forth with TechGDPR to finalize the privacy policy for the GDPR compliance requirement of the Stakeholder Database. Other Programs - @Davidutro Emergency Communications Support program work has been on the backlog, not much progress has been made in July. This will be a high priority in August.

                    "content": " Thanks for reading the monthly update of the DUX (Development & UX) Core Unit! These updates serve as a vehicle for transparency with regards to our work and focus. We aim to stick to the format suggested by @Artem_Gordon of @gov-comms-core-unit. In addition to these lower-timeframe updates we do quarterly roadmap updates on the Forum. Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr Last month we finally got to launch the refactored codebase of the Governance Portal, which contained months of effort. In addition to one more feature-focussed release after that, we\u2019ve made some serious progress on a few R&D projects we have been working on. Also, we have been increasingly collaborating with other Core Units such as GovAlpha, TechOps, and Immunefi Security. Lastly we have been spending a lot of time defining our roadmap focus for Q2 2022 through internal conversation but also cross-CU coordination. Let\u2019s dive in!   Product updates We launched two updates to the Governance Portal this past month. In addition we have been progressing on R&D projects that involve more complex features that also require cross-Core Unit collaboration.  Governance Portal updates First and foremost, we shipped the biggest ever update to the Governance Portal codebase. The update involved a code refactor focussed on replacing key dependencies on deprecated libraries, refactoring a lot of data fetching & handling mechanisms, and introducing a new testing suite. More details on this refactor can be found here. In a few days we\u2019ll ship another update which is more feature-focussed. It includes the long-awaited \u2018On-Chain Effects\u2019 feature for easily digging into the impact of executive spells on the Maker Protocol. The update also includes \u2018Share your Vote\u2019, which aims to decrease the gap between the Governance Portal and the Governance Forum, and make the lives of recognized delegates a bit easier by simplifying the UX of sharing comments/reasoning behind their poll votes. Expect the release this Tuesday and check the release notes to see what\u2019s new! Lastly; be on the lookout for a redesigned landing page for the Governance Portal later this month   Research & Development These past months DUX team has slowly shifted focus from isolated GovPortal work towards more research and cross-CU collaboration. We realised that the key to making an impact as a Core Unit is not solely in incremental improvements to the Governance Portal, but in identifying what\u2019s relevant to MakerDAO and other Core Units, in order to initiate/participate in larger initiatives that ultimately lead to improving the governance UX of Maker. This work is more complex and requires more long-term thinking and planning, as well as investing time and effort into research. By structuring this work in parallel to our main design & development sprints we\u2019re getting more comfortable with this renewed focus. Here\u2019s what we have been working on this past month:  Further iterating on two potential implementations for gasless poll voting, which will soon be presented to GovAlpha. We hope to bring this to development in Q2 '22.  Looking into a data caching solution to decrease loading times throughout the Governance Portal. Improving our Q&A practices and setup.  Exploring means to incentivise delegation, mainly inspired by this excellent discussion sparked by @GFXlabs  In collaboration with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit\u2014a tagging system for governance polls, which would enable richer categorisation and labelling of the ever-growing number of polls.   Team updates  Partnership with TechOps We formalised our collaboration with the @techops-core-unit. Their team has been a backbone of our work for a long time through managing and monitoring critical infrastructure, as well as providing support in case of incidents. In addition to proving support when necessary, we will collaborate with TechOps to 1) further improve our Q&A setup, 2) expand and improve our monitoring system, and 3) further consolidate & optimise deployments. We\u2019re very excited about this collaboration and we\u2019re looking forward to learn from them.  Defining Q2 Roadmap These past weeks we have also been slowly putting together the roadmap for Q2 2022. Our aim has been to sync our roadmap with what\u2019s relevant at MakerDAO and what other Core Units are working on. A lot of the work will be in collaboration with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit for example, or will be related to the upcoming launch of multi-chain spells as part of the Maker Wormhole project. Be on the lookout for our quarterly roadmap spotlight update later this week!  Organising a workshop during Devconnect   Devconnect is just around the corner\u2014a week-long conference in Amsterdam, organised by the Ethereum Foundation. We have our sights set on a sub-event called Global Governance Gathering, organised by the folks at The DAOist. They delivered an amazing event in Lisbon last year and have garnished a rich community of DAO governance thinkers and builders. We are proud to announce that Maker DUX team is organising & facilitating a full-day design sprint workshop as part of Global Governance Gathering. We are also putting in a $6.5k sponsorship for the event, thanks to @Growth-Core-Unit  More info about the workshop will be shared soon.

Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr June has been a productive and focussed month for DUX, with most of our time and energy being focussed on two features; Delegate Migration and Gasless Poll Voting. We\u2019ve also continued work on making our stack more efficient and resilient, which became more urgent due to the recent uptick in website traffic and # of Maker Governance delegate contracts. DUX won\u2019t be doing any travelling and/or events over the summer to continue focus on the aforementioned work and prepare for Q3.   Product updates This past month the DUX team focussed on further developing the \u2018Delegate Migration\u2019 and \u2018Gasless Poll Voting\u2019 features. We\u2019ve also collaborated with @GovAlpha-Core-Unit on the 2nd part of the new Governance Metadata system. Lastly; we\u2019ve spent time developing a short-term mitigation to a rate-limiting issue which has been causing problems lately. The latter started becoming a more urgent problem ever since we\u2019ve seen sharp increases in traffic to the Governance Portal, combined with a sharp increase in # of delegates on Maker Governance.  Governance Portal updates We\u2019ve deployed two updates to the Governance Portal in the month of June 2022.  On June 1st we launched version v0.5.0 which was focussed on dealing with complexity as Maker governance becomes more complex (ie. more delegates and an ever-growing number of polls). On June 27th we deployed version v0.6.0 which contained the aforementioned rate-limiting mitigation and more optimisations.   Research & Development  We\u2019ve finalised the research and architecture design phase for the Gasless Poll Voting feature, which is now in active development. As mentioned in last month\u2019s CU update; The gasless poll voting system will be based on L2 voting, but a subsidised model where the GovPortal stack uses a relayer service to post L2 transactions on behalf of the user. The system we\u2019re developing will be fully compatible with Maker\u2019s current voting system (ie. does not break integrations with custodians, still allows users to vote on L1 if they prefer), will be free for the user, and will be available to all MKR holders and delegates. The feature is set to release in Q3.  In June we\u2019ve ironed out the last design decisions related to the \u2018Delegate Migration\u2019 feature, which is now in development and slated for release in ~2 weeks. The feature is aimed at facilitating the migration process for expiring delegate contracts, both for recognized delegates and delegators.  We\u2019ve continued working on the performance issues we mentioned in last month\u2019s CU update. Besides our work related to a rate-limiting issue (ie. optimising data fetching and developing middleware), we\u2019ve started exploring optimisations to make the Governance Portal more efficient and reliable when it comes to requesting and handling blockchain data.   Team updates  Team efficiency Besides the aforementioned optimisations to the Governance Portal to make it handle blockchain data more efficient, we\u2019re renegotiating our annual contract with Alchemy (the RPC endpoint provider of our team) in an effort to try and bring down the associated spending. We\u2019ve also made cuts to our SaaS usage (ie. Canny, Calendly) and are working on a more efficient process for managing CU spend through team creditcards.  TechOps collaboration We\u2019ve been onboarded to a new process set up by @techops-core-unit to handle our requests, which has already proven useful. In addition we\u2019ve started briefing them on our requests related to the Gasless Poll Voting feature release. TechOps will be an important partner in providing the required infrastructure and QA systems.  Preparing for team offsite We\u2019ve also started preparing for our 2nd and last team offsite of 2022, which will be centered around the devcon conference in Colombia. As part of the preparation we wrote an application for organizing a workshop as part of the conference, similar to what we\u2019ve delivered at devconnect Amsterdam. We\u2019re very much looking forward to the offsite as it has been four months already since our team got together irl and we (already) feel like it\u2019s long overdue. Counting down till October!  Improving collaboration infrastructure As part of the aforementioned initiative, @0xdeniz has been progressing the three sub-initiatives which are 1) a debating course for delegates, 2) cross-CU work on making MakerDAO community calls more effective & efficient, and lastly 3) preparing a creative facilitation/leadership training for CU facilitators.

The Governance Communications Core Unit is responsible for several programs focusing on stakeholder coordination and informational accessibility.  August Priorities August was slower than usual, with team members taking some needed time off. Overall, it was still quite productive as we kept momentum on all our active projects while keeping an eye out on the shifting landscape with EndGame maturing, regulatory risk heating up, and the overall conversations going on around the future of MakerDAO.  Publications This month we started on an objective to automate work related to stakeholder publications. Our team began developing a forum scraper that provides a faster and more efficient method of searching for Core Unit updates. Otherwise, August was business as usual, with our team continuing to improve publication quality. Monthly Core Unit Updates were published as pinned threads and were live updated as teams posted their updates for both July and August. Weekly Relay publications prioritized accurately presenting the most prominent issues at hand, such as the Real-World Finance split and offboarding [1, 2] as well as community concerns regarding TORNADO sanctions and Maker\u2019s USDC dominance.  Improving Design We\u2019ve hired a design contributor to help us improve the visual experience we put forward. Good design has many benefits; It reduces noise, utilizes visual imagery, and leads to better absorption of information. We completed an initial style guide and two slide deck templates (1), (2). We\u2019ve also begun compiling a Design Library that\u2019s open for anyone to use.  Click  to check out a gif of the style guide! https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9sZ4Fv-86WNQK51HUy6aMC9x_dhGNHV82w5HPdcbmWGCWkXgiXz6-Lqth81xdCxHHcU_9k-_xew06UMrM5CC49je2PiIPaKxqgkxlmVxAwUPowC91XE_gY5SVMIzVKyAMF5D0MJdJ5rNw_o3vQGQ69WQU_aWWthYabj8bzpd4_O7W5V5PdHqze4f(image larger than 4 MB)   Completing the Communications Audit We aimed to complete the written audit report and overview video by the end of August but could not hit the self-imposed deadline. The completion of this work is spilling over into September; expect some awesome stuff here soon! If you don\u2019t want to wait, check out the data.   Stakeholder Database Progress Work was done this month to bring our Privacy Policy & Personal Data Protection Policy up to proper quality with the help of TechGDPR. The documents are still private. However, we will accept view requests from delegates or core unit members. We\u2019re one step closer to setting up a GDPR-compliant stakeholder database that could be a tool for the entire DAO.  Call Support & Improvements Governance and Risk Support: Agenda coordination, weekly forum thread, Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, calendar support, and slide deck. Changes: Changed discussion topic types to be rooted in RFC or Formally Submitted proposals. CMON, CMOFF, & SEC Stakeholder Alignment Calls Support: Facilitation, agenda coordination, Zoom hosting, recording, attendance tracking, calendar support, and async work around initiative management. Changes: No changes. CSI Update Call Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, and attendance tracking. Changes: No changes. Rune\u2019s DVC / Endgame Calls Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, attendance tracking, and calendar support. Changes: None. Delegate Office Hours Support: Provide a weekly forum thread with a topic-discussion poll, Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, and calendar support. Changes: None. Mandated Actors Support: Minimal; we are part of the discussion regarding the purpose of the call. Changes: No changes.  Emergency Comms Support The Emergency Playbook and Emergency Preparedness Video were set as a high priority in August but were not completed according to our estimated timeline. The timeline kept being pushed up for a couple of reasons; lack of contributors to help on emergency documentation for incident types and @Davidutro\u2019s lack of bandwidth (teammate work quality assurance, administrative duties, and a week off.) For September, we are partnering with TechOps to onboard all service owners to Pager Duty. The emergency preparedness video & playbook may be pushed to October as September is a heavy month for the facilitator due to the need for a couple of major administrative MIP proposals that need to be up by October for RFC.  Upskilling the team with Mischief Makers @Davidutro and @thomas.flitter participated in several group training sessions to improve our call facilitation skills.   Mischief Makers    Mischief Makers Website: Homepage Welcome to the homepage of Mischief Makers, a Facilitation Agency bringing energy and enjoyment to working and learning. Here, you'll be sure to find out about what we do, who we are and what we offer - and much more.       Decentralized Operations Workshop David began participating in the Decentralized Ops Scoping Workshops in partnership with DUX, GOV, and SES in an effort to rethink all the operational touchpoints of the DAO and how they can be optimized. We are excited to continue these into September and possibly October.

The quality of things increases greatly when you have a few rounds of feedback from a pair of critical fresh eyes! In August, more of my time was required than I had anticipated. It mostly involved our work on the Stakeholder Database GDPR stuff, the Communications Audit, and our several working sessions with the new design contributor.

                    "content": " Thanks for reading the monthly update of the DUX (Development & UX) Core Unit! These updates serve as a vehicle for transparency with regards to our work and focus. We aim to stick to the format suggested by @Artem_Gordon of @gov-comms-core-unit. In addition to these lower-timeframe updates we do quarterly roadmap updates on the Forum. Lastly, we\u2019re always available for inquiries on the MakerDAO Discord or on our DUX Discord server.     tl;dr The month of May has been a productive one for the DUX team. No offsites or events\u2014just heads-down researching and building. We have made good progress on our roadmap items such as gasless poll voting, a new governance metadata system, and more!. We\u2019ve spent most of our time on technical research & design, but we also launched one major update to the Governance Portal. In addition we\u2019ve contributed to the design of the MakerDAO Transparency Dashboard that\u2019s in development by SES Core Unit. Lastly @0xdeniz has been spearheading some initiatives related to improving collaboration infrastructure at MakerDAO, which are mostly aimed at CU facilitators and recognized delegates.   Product updates  Governance Portal updates Earlier this week we launched an update to the Governance Portal which was focussed on dealing with complexity as Maker governance becomes more complex (ie. more delegates and an ever-growing number of polls). The update introduced new features such as a new system for managing governance metadata, search functionality and improvements to filtering. Besides making it easier for users to find what they\u2019re looking for, the aforementioned metadata system also increases the design space we have for the Governance Portal and (for example) allows for easier addition of new poll types. Refer to the release notes to learn about the other new features and improvements.  Research & Development  Last month we\u2019ve devoted a lot of time on technical research, primarily focussed on a root-cause analysis of performance issues we have been observing. These issues made for intermittent errors and unacceptable loading times for data fetching. Through the analysis we were able to uproot various causes, do a ton of refactoring work on how we do data fetching in the GovPortal, and define some larger initiatives that intend to work on at a later time. This document provides a good overview of the research outcome.  We have started working on the implementation of gasless poll voting. Currently we are wrapping up technical research to iron out the last unknowns, getting the polling contract ready on Arbitrum and creating wireframes for the UX. The gasless poll voting system will be based on L2 voting, but a subsidised model where the GovPortal stack uses a relayer service to post L2 transactions on behalf of the user. The system we\u2019re developing will be fully compatible with Maker\u2019s current voting system (ie. does not break integrations with custodians, still allows users to vote on L1 if they prefer), will be free for the user, and will be available to all MKR holders and delegates.   Implementing a gasless poll voting system is our #1 priority and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time designing a system that makes sense in the long run. We believe that our design is a good tradeoff between lowering user friction & cost, security, and neutrality. Most importantly; it\u2019s fully bespoke to Maker governance and therefore does not introduce fragmentation or reliance on third-party infrastructure.   We are anticipating the upcoming expiry of delegate contracts which will require action from both delegates and delegators. We have coordinated with members of GovAlpha CU and Protocol Engineering CU to decide on how to approach the situation and we\u2019ve decided to build a migration flow for the Governance Portal, guiding both delegates and delegators through the process. For the longer-term, DUX, PE and GovAlpha agreed that improvements to the vote delegation smart contracts is desirable to mitigate the need for annual migration, in addition to other improvements. Work on this improved smart contract will start over the next weeks but is of low priority for now.   Team updates  Holiday planning With the summer months coming up we have been planning individual holidays/time off. Our designer Tiago went offline for a few weeks last month to enjoy a well-earned holiday, and over the next four months we have more DUX team members taking a break. We succeeded in planning the holidays/off-time such that 2/3rd of the team will always be available and productive. This allows us to continue progress on our work and be available in case of emergencies.   Do you have any feedback or feature requests for the Governance Portal, or ideas for improving Maker\u2019s governance UX in general?

                    "content": " 1600\u00d7368 73.6 KB  The Governance Communications Core Unit is responsible for programs that focus on stakeholder coordination and informational accessibility. Below is information about our priorities and DAO-facing work from last month.  September Priorities   Budget MIP drafted according to new rules. Call support as usual. Communications audit completion. Decentralized Ops Workshop-associated work. Merge of CMOFF/CMON stakeholder alignment calls. Onboard service owners to pager duty.  Privacy and Personal Data Protection policy finalization. Stakeholder content program process automation via release of the V1 forum scraper tool used to automate CU Updates.  Improvement of GnR.   Team Restructuring A decision was made to let go of Thomas Flitter. We will not be replacing him with another full-time contributor. Instead, we are on the hunt for part-time contributors to fill the gap. Our next budget proposal decreases funds for full-time salaried positions while increasing funds for part-time contributors. We expect this change to result in more efficient fulfillment of our mandate, with the next budget instance set to experience a bottom-line reduction of ~23% if passed.  Publications This month we started on an objective to automate work related to stakeholder publications. Our team began developing a forum scraper that provides a faster and more efficient method of searching for Core Unit updates. Otherwise, August was business as usual, with our team continuing to improve publication quality. Monthly Core Unit Updates were published as pinned threads and were live updated as teams posted their updates for both August and September. Weekly Relay publications prioritized accurately presenting the most prominent issues at hand, such as the Real-World Finance split and offboarding [1, 2] as well as community concerns regarding TORNADO sanctions and Maker\u2019s USDC dominance.  Completing the Communications Audit We aimed to complete the written audit report and overview video by the end of August but could not hit the self-imposed deadline due to performance issues within the team. We finalized the audit on September 30th, but the report is delayed. Check out the data for all the information. A written report & recorded overview of the round, as well as commentary on the program as a whole, will be published soon. We intend to pause this program in its current form. If requested by a set of Recognized Delegates or MKR holders, we are happy to perform another round as early as Q2 2023. We expect more complexity to emerge as clusters and metaDAOs begin to form due to EndGame.  Stakeholder Database Milestone Complete Work was done this month to finalize our Privacy & Personal Data Protection policies. The documents are now public & available on Discourse and Discord. This important step creates explicit and clear transparency about how GovComms handles this particular data and how we protect it with GDPR principles and guidelines.  Call Support & Improvements Governance and Risk Support: Agenda coordination, weekly forum thread, Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, calendar support, and slide deck. Changes: Skipped polling on weeks with a set plan led by Prose! CMON, CMOFF, & SEC Stakeholder Alignment Calls Support: Facilitation, agenda coordination, Zoom hosting, recording, attendance tracking, calendar support, and async work around initiative management. Changes: CMON & CMOFF were merged into one monthly call. CSI Update Call Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, and attendance tracking. Changes: No changes. Rune\u2019s DVC / Endgame Calls Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, attendance tracking, and calendar support. Changes: Call now only happens once a week, on Wednesdays. Delegate Office Hours Support: Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, calendar support, and forum support. Changes: No more topic polls and a facilitator change; David hosts these now. Mandated Actors Support: Minimal; we are part of the discussion regarding the purpose of the call. Changes: No changes.  Emergency Comms Support We partnered with TechOps to onboard all service owners to Pager Duty. The emergency preparedness video should be ready in October/November. After consulting with other Core Units (GOV, IS, and TECHOPS), we decided the Emergency Playbook should remain a restricted document, only shared with Service Owners, Core Unit members, and some Recognized Delegates. Additionally, we set a milestone to get recognized delegates on a pager duty instance in the coming month or two.  Decentralized Operations Workshop Two workshops were completed, with the second one done on September 1st. Since then, there has been a break in pace. The groups involved plan to revisit the initiative after GovComms completes some work & everyone\u2019s season of offsites and conference travel comes to a close. GovComms conducted several stakeholder interviews in preparation for Workshop 3, which saught to validate, correct, and expand on the drafted touchpoints between various stakeholder groups at MakerDAO. The next workshop is still being planned and does not yet have a set date.  816\u00d7773 105 KB   DAO-Facing Work   Check out our Shared Resources & Trackers folder   September Publications Thread: Weekly Relay  August 30 - September 2, 2022 September 7 - 14, 2022 September 14 - 21, 2022 September 21 - 29, 2022  Thread: Forum at a Glance  September 1 - 7, 2022 September 7 - 14, 2022 September 14 - 21, 2022 September 21 - 28, 2022  Monthly Core Unit Updates  August 2022 September 2022   Call Summaries Governance & Risk:  September 1, 2022 | #206 September 8, 2022 | #207 September 15, 2022 | #208 September 22, 2022 | #209 September 29, 2022 | #210  Others:  Meet Your Delegate #19 | Onestone w/ @TRUEMAKER Coinbase MIP81: CFO Community Questions Collateral Onboarding Call #48 | Gamma Strategies Know Your MIP KYM #13 | MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set Focus On #13 | Centrifuge Q3 Updates   Transparency Govcomms.MakerDAO.Network Notion Page Finances Public Google Drive ",

                    "content": "  Introduction Hey everyone! A quick monthly update from the DUX team before the holidays. Before we dive into what we\u2019ve been up to last month, I want to mention that from January onwards we\u2019ll be exploring a different format for sharing progress & activity updates. Due to Endgame the nature of our work shifted from traditional product development towards one complex R&D project, which also requires a more fitting format for updates. Know that we\u2019re committed to transparency and accountability as being part of the DAO, so we\u2019ll make sure the updates provide good insight into our activity. Most importantly; you\u2019re always welcome to reach out with questions and feedback. Now, back to the December update! In short; we\u2019ve progressed nicely on technical research and design exploration for the \u2018subDAO frontend\u2019 project. Most notably, we\u2019ve prepared and hosted a technical milestone session with key stakeholders of this project. We presented initial research findings & ideas, and were able to gather valuable feedback early on. We\u2019ll organize a similar session focussed on design sometime in January. We\u2019re also gearing up for some team-related changes starting January. Lastly, the whole DUX team is taking a break over the December holidays.   Product updates  Governance Portal No notable updates to the Governance Portal in December. We\u2019ve shifted focus to the SubDAO frontend project, although we do have a refined list of relevant development work ready that will be worked on starting Q1 next year. The defined work will bring the Governance Portal into a more robust and stable state, facing an ever-growing amount of governance metadata and delegates. We will also make sure the adapt the Governance Portal where necessary to account for changes in Maker governance as part of the Endgame transition (one example would be DVC strategies).  SubDAO frontend These past few weeks we\u2019ve progressed nicely with technical research, architecture design and planning for the SubDAO frontend project. The most notable update to share here is that we\u2019ve hosted a technical session with key stakeholders of the project, where we shared initial research results, ideas and recommendations. We were able to get some good feedback and new insights that we\u2019re currently working on. Below I\u2019m sharing a diagram that was used during the session, just to provide a teaser. Note that research is ongoing and the content is subject to change.  Naamloos-2022-12-15-1531.excalidraw1920\u00d7648 83 KB    We plan on hosting a similar session focussed on design patterns & ideas in January. Stay tuned!    Team updates  Recruiting a new fullstack developer DUX is looking for a fullstack developer to join the team starting February 2023. Our ideal candidate looks like this:  Mid to senior experience level Wide range of experience with web2<>web3, web/mobile, and automated testing Comfortable and experienced working with react, Typescript, CSS (nice-to-haves: The Graph, SQL, GraphQL, Solidity) Ample experience with automated testing Has an eye for design Passionate about crypto and DeFi, with a good amount of relevant knowledge Self-starter and able to work fully remote and async In EU or USA timezones  Do you know of potential candidates that would love to contribute to MakerDAO? Hit me up! We\u2019d be very grateful for introductions.   Parental leave Starting in January we\u2019ll have one of our beloved developers go on leave because he\u2019s expecting a newborn baby. We\u2019ve agreed on terms and took measures to make sure the rest of the team does not get blocked.  Temporarily hiring Hernando After discussing with GovAlpha we got the opportunity to temporarily hire their talented developer @hernandoagf! Starting in January, Hernando will help us progress on the Governance Portal while the rest of the DUX team focusses on our new R&D project. We\u2019re very happy to have Hernando around, especially with one developer being on parental leave. We expect great things from Hernando and will make sure to contribute to his skills and career as self-taught developer.  December holidays The DUX team will be on leave between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, spending time with family & friends. Similar to last year, we will take measures to make sure the Governance Portal and related infra are being monitored, with developers on stand-by to respond to any emergencies.  \u2014HAPPY HOLIDAYS!\u2014     Questions or comments based on this update?

                    "content": " TL;DR Last month we released the fourth iteration of the dashboard, featuring:  Dashboard user accounts; Developer experience improvements; Continued support for Core Unit onboarding and reporting  This month, we release Expense Report Auditing as a major new feature to improve reporting accuracy:   Core Unit Auditors are now explicitly listed for each core unit. This also indicates which Core Units are not working with an auditor.   Expense report status tracking makes it easy to see which expense reports are Final, and which reports are still Drafts or under Review by their auditor.   Final reports can no longer be altered by the Core Unit Administrator unless they are explicitly reopened. Auditors can Escalate problematic reports to the community.    Expense report audit trails are now clearly documented in the report\u2019s commenting section. This includes the complete history of when a report was updated, when its status changed, and what comments were left by the Auditor and Core Unit Administrator.   We will finish core unit on-boarding with the final core unit, Data Insights (DIN), by the end of the month. Try it out  Visit our dashboard at https://expenses.makerdao.network/  The GraphQL API can be accessed using the API Explorer  Download the latest Budget Reporting Tool here   NOTICE - the official repository for the Budget Reporting Tool releases was moved to Releases \u00b7 makerdao-ses/ecosystem-reporting-tool-v1 \u00b7 GitHub.   Dashboard Version 0.5 Release  1. Core Unit Auditors See how Core Units are evaluated.  2410\u00d71266 201 KB  The Maker Governance community, and other stakeholders, can now easily see who a Core Unit\u2019s auditor are with Auditor Roles. Auditors can update the status of the budget report on the dashboard, providing data consumers with a quick update on the progress of the budget statement in the reporting process. View the Auditor Role  On the Core Unit About Page of a specific Core Unit, giving quick access to this information at a glance. Within the Comments tab of the Expense Reports Page of specific Core Units, allowing users to understand who different roles within the conversation and changes taking place within an Expense Report.    2. Expense Report Status Tracking Easily see how final an expense report is  2410\u00d71260 212 KB    No more need to guess what the status of an Expense Report is. The status is now clearly visible on the Expense Reports page of each Core Unit.   Four status codes are available: Draft, Review, Final, and Escalated. The data of final and escalated reports can no longer be changed unless they are explicitly reopened.   The only people that can influence these status changes are Core Unit Administrators and Core Unit Auditor roles.   Note that currently, most Expense Reports are still marked as Draft. We will work with the Core Unit Administrators to review past reports and get them up-to-date by the end of next month.   How does it work? To better explain how and when status transitions can happen, we have provided a diagram below.  2410\u00d71260 166 KB   3. Expense Report Audit Trails Get the full Expense Report picture with a complete timeline of events in the comments tab  2410\u00d71282 182 KB    Core Unit Auditors can now provide further context on the Budget Report in the form of comments. Making any changes that need to be made clearer for Core Unit administrators.   Further, any events changing the status of the budget statement can also be viewed in the Comments tab alongside the comments. Allowing users to view how the report has evolved since its original form.   For a more intuitive user experience, we combined all the change tracking events related to the expense report in its comments tab.   Giving the comments section, including status transitions, a timeline feel so that Core Unit Administrators and Auditors can have the full context of what changes happened over time.     What\u2019s next? We are finishing 2022 with all the pieces in place to have accurate expense reporting for all Core Units. In the first months of 2023 we plan to build on top of this functionality, expanding it in multiple directions:   Next to Core Unit budgets, we plan to provide similar budget details for all of the Maker Protocol\u2019s operational expenses   Existing expense structures such as Special Purpose Funds, Delegates\u2019 compensation, and various contingency buffers.   With the Endgame Plan taking shape we expect to soon add budgets for new operational structures too. This includes Scopes, Projects, SubDAOs, and potentially Ecosystem Actors.     With detailed financial reports in place, we can start adding aggregated views to the dashboard as well. Financial summaries will allow stakeholders to view total expenses over time, with the ability to filter for specific budget categories and parameters.   The features we are offering so far will be leveraged to role out Project Based Budgeting, which will include KPIs, milestones, and deliverables next to the financial data.     Holiday Break Before all this, however, @SES-Core-Unit will take our New Year\u2019s break. The team will be out in the coming two weeks, from December 24th until January 9th.   We wish everyone some well-deserved time off and a Happy New Year!    Feedback? We\u2019re happy to answer your questions here, on our SES Discord server, or SES CU channel in the MakerDAO Discord.

Below is information about our priorities and DAO-facing work from last month.  October Priorities Improve publications Support calls Create a generalized Call Support Tracker Close out the Forum Scraper side project Create Offboarding Checklist Offboarding actions for 3x CUs Attend Devcon Bogota Improve transparency dashboard Hunt for research contributors  Improve Publications Several improvements were made to our publications.  To reduce redundancy, the Weekly Relay no longer contains a vote and polls section. This information is readily available through the Governance Voting Portal, and weekly MIPs update. The Weekly Relay is now posted each Monday morning, covering all the events taking place the previous week. The Forum Recap is now pre-recorded and posted on YouTube as well as the Forum at a Glance publications thread.  We created a publications tracker an an effort to improve contributor workflow, measure relevant information, and archive a record of our publications and who worked on them.   Call Support & Improvements Governance and Risk Support: Agenda coordination, weekly forum thread, Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, calendar support, and slide deck. Changes: Topic Poll launched before the weekend, giving more lead time for preparation. CM & SEC Stakeholder Alignment Calls Support: Facilitation, agenda coordination, Zoom hosting, recording, calendar support, and async work related to the initiatives. Changes: No changes. CSI Update Call Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, and support. Changes: No changes. Rune\u2019s DVC / Endgame Calls Support: Provide Zoom hosting, recording, YouTube upload, attendance tracking, and calendar support. Changes: No changes. Delegate Office Hours Support: Zoom hosting, call moderation, recording, YouTube upload, and calendar support. Changes: More unrecorded sessions. Mandated Actors Support: Minimal, we are part of the discussion regarding the purpose of the call. Changes: No changes.  Call Support Tracker Since Call Support has become a general program our team is responsible for, we\u2019ve set up an internally used, but publicly viewable, tracker to help us keep things organized and accounted for.  Forum Scraper The forum scraping tool was completed. The final step is to move it to a GitHub repository under an MIT open-source software license. Moving forward, we will use this tool to publish the Monthly Core Unit Updates more efficiently.  Offboarding Checklist & Actions With the votes to offboard three Core Units, we decided to create a useful DAO resource that would help ensure a higher standard of operational security\u2013an Offboarding Checklist. We worked together with TechOps and GovAlpha to properly and fully offboard the Events, Strategic Happiness, and Real World Finance Core Units.  DevCon Bogota @Davidutro traveled to Colombia to support MakerDAO stakeholders, hunt for new contributors, and participate in the latest talks on governance, culture, and communications with other industry leaders. GovComms  Attended GitCoin\u2019s Schelling Point Unconference. Attended Devcon Bogota & participated in MakerDAO-related workshops. Hosted a stakeholder dinner for ~60 people.
