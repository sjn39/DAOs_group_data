Today we are having a RWA collateral call. One of the projects that joined us very briefly last year is going to present again so we can go more in detail into the project, how it works and how the interaction with MakerDAO would work. This company is Peoples Company (website). Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

Hi, Alexis. @amyjung is maintaining a Google Calendar (not sure if this duty can be shared in the future). I added to my own calendar and cannot remember how to do it (or get the link). I\u2019ve screamed a couple times at the UI/UX to no avail. I try to keep this table updated with the upcoming (and past) calls, although I understand that it\u2019s less ideal. I also pin the topic to the forum (first locally and globally on the same day). Maybe there\u2019s an easy way of converting one of these into an ics file. I\u2019ll try to research something. TL;DR: maintaining this over different channels is not ideal. ",
