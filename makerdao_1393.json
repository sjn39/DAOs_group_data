I am involved at a minimum level, which includes managing the team and a final review before posting the transcription on the Forum. Most of this managing is done through a tracker sheet and schedule.     juan:  2.- Does this include the cost of onboarding new scribes?   There is a small cost for onboarding new scribes. I have a document containing prerecorded onboarding videos and quizzes as a mandatory requirement to be onboarded. It\u2019s about 3-4 hours long, and new hires get paid 100 Dai to complete it. However, there has only been one new hire during Q2.     juan:  Do they need to be stored in the Maker Forum?   That\u2019s a good question. I would like to reduce the number of clicks a person would have to go through to reach a transcription, which is why they are posted directly under the respective \u2018public-call\u2019 thread. But one alternative is to upload the transcription as a web PDF and then link that to the YouTube video description.     juan:  Not sure how accessible they are (in terms of search, topics, groups, tags, etc.).   I agree. The advanced search filter option is helpful but does not always bring up the most relevant thread (from my own experience). I have thought about whether this happens to others if trying to look up something mentioned in a public call. Overall, the forum may not be the ideal place for transcriptions, but the question we bring forward is whether transcriptions are being used at all. ",

First while I have not used the transcriptions or editorials I can say for a fact that if you don\u2019t have them it is impossible to search for anything.   Transcriptions make it possible to search for keywords and to isolate discussions - REALLY, really important if you think what Maker discussed in the past is important for discussions on same topic now.   Personally I think the DAO is caring less about what was discussed a year ago on any topic since many new posters frequently try to engage on the same topics that have been discussed in the past without doing a search.  I can also say that using the search doesn\u2019t often yield what I know I am looking for but I have not spent a lot of time on finding out why. There also is no sense of gathering DAO discussions on topics in transcriptions to create a discussion topic library (I mean we don\u2019t have money and time I am sure). Lastly.  This subject is a perfect job for someone visually disabled like my wife as she used to do book conversions to braille paid for by the page at not so great a rate btw (she maybe earned $8-10/hr a decade ago).  Not sure she would do it but visually disabled people desperately need incomes - why not post a job with reasonable hourly or pay/page specifically for someone who is visually disabled to work on.? I look at monthly cost as listed at 2.5-3K, not sure this would be a full or 1/2 time job for someone of if the DAO is just looking to cut costs but the DAO literally could post a part time job for transcription/editing for 30-36K/yr and I can have my wife run it by the disabled community to see if there are any takers.   Now if you want to do it on contract (i.e. by transcription) you can try that as well.  idk Just a few things to think about. I talked with my wife and one thing she was talking about was how Maker websites didn\u2019t conform to accessibility standards (like they were not accessible), which is quite common btw. ",

Honestly seems like all the \u2018discussions\u2019 just fall through cracks and are left in the subjective memory of people.   I have never done a search but every time I see information presented in video I am like - well where in the hell was that little gem in the 1-2hr video recording. So I agree with your comment in terms of whether users have a need.  I don\u2019t think so.  If a recording is transparency well we could just archive a shit ton of videos and have some little gems well buried after the 5000th hour of recordings that would come up instantly in searches.

Transcribe when requested (any participant can request ahead of call). Keep a forum post open for transcription requests. Iterate towards a threshold when actual transcription happens. My two cents.
