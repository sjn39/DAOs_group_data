Our know-how: 1-click any-to-any native assets swaps (like CAKE BEP20 to JOE AVAX), both EVM and non-EVM networks supported. Some media links: Decrypt, CoinDesk, Binance, Cointelegraph. Important: Through Symbiosis, liquidity from different networks will be able to flow seamlessly into the Optimism ecosystem. Why do you believe what you are building is going to succeed?:   The DeFi market is in great need of simplification. For newcomers, dealing with a multitude of networks and protocols can be quite challenging. Moreover, the process of interacting with them is often unclear. Therefore, if we aspire to attract more users to the crypto industry, simplification is the only way to achieve this goal. Symbiosis has successfully achieved this objective by providing easy any-to-any swaps, as well as cross-chain zaps, which enable users to interact with DeFi protocols quickly and effortlessly.   Symbiosis solutions are truly one-of-a-kind. Unlike a mere bridge, Symbiosis functions as a cross-chain AMM DEX, with all liquidity residing on the L2 network. It serves as an interchain communication protocol and enables users to swap their assets and transfer liquidity between chains with a single click, all in one transaction.   In terms of current market products, we are steadily surviving on the Bear Market   A significant number of partners are already using our solution (OpenOcean, Rango, 1inch, XDAO, IME, ChainSpot and others) and many others require a high-quality solution.   How many users does your project have currently? Please include how you arrived at this estimate: Users: 17,5\u043a+ SIS token Holders: 4,690 Explorer v1: https://explorer-v1.symbiosis.finance/transactions Explorer v2: https://explorer.symbiosis.finance/transactions  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximizing the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: \u2022 By offering rewards in liquidity pools, Symbiosis can attract liquidity more effectively. \u2022 Symbiosis can utilize OP tokens for airdrop to active Symbiosis users on Optimism. \u2022 The reliability of the project will improve with a grant from Optimism, leading to a more positive perception of Symbiosis within the Optimism community. Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: Our aim is to provide crypto enthusiasts with the ability to perform cross-chain swaps from any network to Optimism, as well as leverage products developed on Optimism. By doing so, we are contributing to the adoption of the Optimism network and boosting the total value locked. How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: For the entire duration of the project   Symbiosis users can see one click to exchange tokens from one network (for example, from Ethereum) for any token on the Optimism network.   Supplying liquidity with cross-chain Zaps to Optimism lending and farming protocols (such as Velodrome, Curve, Beefy and others) and liquidity pools owned by Symbiosis.   A user who has any asset on any blockchain can transfer it in one click (within a single transaction) to the lending or farming protocol for Optimism or to the liquidity pools belonging to Symbiosis with cross-chain Zaps.

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Total metrics TVL (Total Value Locked): $1 332 864 Transactions: 41\u041a+ Addresses: 17,5\u043a+ Amounts: $68mln+ The V1 protocol was launched in March 2022. During the 9 months of operation of the v1 protocol , the following indicators were achieved: Transactions: 28k+ Amounts: $49mln+ The V2 protocol was launched at the end of December 2022 and has the following indicators: Transactions: 12,5\u043a+ Amounts: $17mln+ Metrics Defilama https://defillama.com/protocol/symbiosis-finance Dune (Not full analytics): https://dune.com/vvv300/symbiosis Who are your competitors, and are they on Optimism?:   Celler   Multichain   Stargate   Please link to code audits (if any): Docs: Security Audits of Symbiosis - Symbiosis Documentation Team Who are your founders?: Will K - https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-87535b94/ Nick Avramov - https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickavramov Alexey Lushnikov - https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexey-lushnikov/ What makes your team well-suited to carry out the project described in this proposal? The core team has been in the crypto industry from 2017 and inDeFi from the beginning of 2019. We were testing our own products, consulted and developed for different projects, audited DeFi smart contracts and have always been at the cutting edge of this industry. So the product originated from the team\u2019s deep understanding of technology and the current needs. The people who have joined the project now are extremely motivated by the problems that they are solving and the potential scale of Symbiosis. More about team: https://daomaker.com/company/symbiosis-finance#team-and-partners Is this your first Web3 project?: Yes Grant Request What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 35\u043a OP How do you justify the size of the grant?:   90% of tokens as a reward for LP providers for Optimism USDC pool on Symbiosis in 6 month period: April 25% May 20% June 15% July 15% August 15% September 10%   10% distribution of tokens among users who have made a cross-chain swap to the Optimism network (the 150 most active users will be able to receive rewards for cross-chain swaps). Rewards will be distributed in OP tokens.   Roadmap and Distribution Plan Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: Critical milestones:  Deploy Optimism pool for cross-chain swaps Launch Farming for Optimism pool Integrate Optimism project into cross-chain zaps  Milestones:  Research and analytics Add Optimism to relayers network Deploy USDC pool on Optimism for cross-chain swaps Add 1inch/OpenOcean SDK for on-chain routing Launch Farming for Optimism pool Start marketing promotion Enable cross-chain swaps via cross-chain aggregators which use Symbiosis under the hood. Among them: OpenOcean, Rango, Rubic, Via and more Integrate Optimism project into cross-chain zaps Start promotion cross-chain zaps with Optimism dapps Distribute tokens for active Optimism users  How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. See the no sale rule here 3): 90% in the OP will be distributed among our LP providers in six months Also, In six months, we will distribute 10% of OP tokens to our active users Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?: 6 months Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:   Integrate Optimism for cross-chain swaps;   Integrate 2 protocols on Optimism for cross-chain zaps;   Implement Liquidity pool for Optimism and add 150k of initial liquidity;   Launch farming for Optimism pool.   Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone:   connecting L2 Optimism to the relayers network;   deployment of contracts for the Optimism pool;   deployment of initial liquidity;   connection to on-chain routing of transactions using on-chain DEX Optimism.   If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Because we also have rewards in native SIS tokens, which we will start distributing once OP liquidity runs out, and also users can receive liquidity provider fee. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): ERC20 https://etherscan.io/token/0xd38BB40815d2B0c2d2c866e0c72c5728ffC76dd9  BEP20 https://bscscan.com/address/0xf98b660adf2ed7d9d9d9daacc2fb0cace4f21835  Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/token/0x9e758b8a98a42d612b3d38b66a22074dc03d7370 BridgeV2 https://etherscan.io/address/0x5523985926Aa12BA58DC5Ad00DDca99678D7227E Portal https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8f275fBf7A959F4BCE59999A2EF122A099e81A8 Metarouter https://etherscan.io/address/0xE75C7E85FE6ADd07077467064aD15847E6ba9877 MetaRouterGateway https://etherscan.io/address/0x25bEE8C21D1d0ec2852302fd7E674196EA298eC6 Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?:   Symbiosis provides an easy and convenient way to enter the Optimism ecosystem from any evm/non-evm network (Polygon, BNB chain, Avalanche, Ethereum, Milkomeda, Aurora, Telos. Soon Ton, Tron, Aptos, SUI).   Symbiosis provides a convenient way to get any token on the Optimism side by the user, whether it is a stable, gas token or a project token.   Symbiosis increases utilization of Optimism defi services due to cross-chain zaps, which allows users not just to get a project token, but to get a profitable position in any yield protocol. What does this mean? That any user can purchase a position from any chain in AAVE, Beefy, Reaper Form and others in any token by paying only the gas price.   Symbiosis increases the use of the already existing DEX ecosystem and aggregators (1inch, OpenOcean), because we use on-chain routing. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?:   Symbiosis will provide a convenient way to enter the optimism ecosystem from connected chains (Polygon, BNB chain, Avalanche, Ethereum, Milkomeda, Aurora, Telos. Soon Ton, Tron, Aptos, SUI).   Symbiosis is integrated with such major players as OpenOcean, Ime App, Rubic, Via exchange, Rango, XDAO and others. All these users will instantly have access to the Optimism ecosystem.   Existing defi on Optimism can attract new users themselves through cross-chain zaps.   Is your project Optimism Native?: We\u2019re a cross-chain project, that said, cross-chain native. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

                    "content": " Basic Details  Project name: Alluo  Author name and forum name (please provide a reliable point of contact for the project): Alastair Preacher / Preacherman  L2 recipient address: 0xc7061dD515B602F86733Fa0a0dBb6d6E6B34aED4  Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11  I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders 3 and Growth Experiments 4 Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Yes  Project Details  What are you building?: Alluo is a DAO. It is a DeFi project that is democratising access to financial services. The protocol utilises web3 and DeFi to achieve this goal and aims to find a sweet spot between traditional fintech and DeFi. Alluo gives all customers access to personal finance tools, great rates, and non-custodial access to their funds while taking away all the complexity of DeFi and delivering a seamless user experience. The Alluo Protocol that powers the mobile app and dApp is a cross-chain Yield Optimization and Liquidity Direction Protocol and Exchange to facilitate the decentralised and autonomous execution of the governance process. It can exchange tokens and execute cross-chain funds deployment in a variety of DeFi yield farming strategies in a fully trustless and automated manner. At its simplest, anyone with an internet connection can get an account that generates stable DeFi yield on the money they deposit on the Alluo Mobile or Web App (including crypto assets on the dAPP). Anyone can send money to their family and friends globally. Anyone can withdraw anytime for free - no lockups. Anyone can enjoy the benefit of no minimum deposits. Anyone can have an account. That\u2019s what makes Alluo, for everyone. Mobile app users can easily deposit fiat and earn DeFi yields or stream interest bearing $USD globally in an instant with zero crypto knowledge. Alluo Pro users can also deposit a variety of crypto assets to access more complex boosted DeFi strategies that are typically out of reach for even proficient DeFi users given the cost and time taken to run such strategies. The Alluo \u2018Pro\u2019 dApp also offers additional enhanced features such as earning yield whilst Dollar Cost Averaging into ETH and BTC. The mobile and web apps allow both experienced DeFi enthusiasts and less experienced retail users to access the DeFi features they want, with a Fintech-like user experience, in a decentralised and non-custodial manner. Users can interact with the protocol at the smart contract level, via the web interface or the non-custodial mobile app wallet deployed. Alluo is DeFi on autopilot, for everyone. Our dAPP is currently live on Polygon and Ethereum mainnet. Our non-custodial mobile app is on Polygon. However, we want to bring our unique DeFi on autopilot, Fintech-like user experience and mobile-app user base to Optimism, to bring more liquidity to Optimism from Polygon & Ethereum, but also critically, completely new-to-chain as well. We propose to:  Redeploy the Alluo decentralised web app (dApp) on Optimism Migrate the Alluo non-custodial mobile app to Optimism Deploy the yield generation part of the Alluo Liquidity Direction Protocol and Exchange on Optimism Create a white-label payment API enabling fast on/off ramp for stablecoins to Optimism  We have applied for a separate builder grant specifically for this element here    Integrate the payment API into the non-custodial Alluo mobile app Integrate the payment API into Alluo dAPP  All of the above will be self-funded, with the exception of the white-label payment API which we have submitted a separate builder grant for. In building the above we will be able to bring off-chain liquidity from both our mobile app and dAPP users and deploy in existing yield farms on Optimism from the likes of Beefy, Velodrome and Synthetix. In addition, we will be able to direct existing liquidity already captured on Polygon and Mainnet to Optimism to farm within the same strategies. Initially, we will offer on and off-ramping of USDC as USDC constitutes more than half of the stablecoins on the OP chain today. However, later we will enable other currencies such as agEUR or sEUR for Euro to increase appeal. Finally, given the flexible nature of the on-ramp, once live we will also build the ability for customers to enter into any of the farms directly from their bank account, without having to exchange any tokens or create the LPs themselves. As far as we know this will be unique to Optimism, creating a sleek DeFi user experience significantly ahead of its peers.  Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: With over $1bn of TVL and >40% MoM change in the last month (Defillama) Optimism is clearly attracting users and liquidity to the chain. By far the vast majority of those users are bridging funds to Optimism using Centralised exchanges. Centralised exchanges have their place, but add unnecessary customer friction and significantly limit the potential for funds to be attracted to Optimism, especially from less technical and first-time users. From having to register for a relevant CEX, waiting for funds to be authorised, and bridging to OP, this whole process can take over a day or more. For new users, sending funds from a CEX to their wallet on chain can be a nerve-wracking experience between the risk of sending funds to the wrong chain or making a mistake when copying their wallet address (it is not rare for people to send funds directly to an ERC20 token address like USDC by mistake). This is all before they even have to start to work out how to interact with LPs and yield farms which presents yet another significant hurdle for the new customer. We believe that providing retail customers with a simple, easy route to earn great DeFI yields on OP direct from mobile and dApp, with a Fintech-like UX, will step-change the volume of customers and liquidity interacting with dApps on OP. Furthermore, enabling end-users to onramp directly on the dApps themselves (like Alluo, Velodrome, Synthetix etc.) with a market-leading user experience will lead to a significant increase in the number of users experiencing Optimisim as their first blockchain in a way that is in line with their prior web2 experiences. Doing this without the need to go through a CEX is also something that is aligned with our and the foundation\u2019s ambition to improve decentralisation. Adding OP tokens as an incentive will give people the motivation to try this new route and we are confident once they experience the step-change in experience it will become the norm going forward.  How many users does your project have currently? (Please include how you arrived at this estimate:) We have more than 1k users with TVL of $2.6m across polygon and ethereum mainnet and 30k+ transactions. Our yield bearing USD (29k transactions): Interest Bearing Alluo USD (IbAlluoUSD) Token Tracker | PolygonScan And the streamed version (13.7k transactions): Streaming IbAlluo USD (StIbAlluoUSD) Token Tracker | PolygonScan    DeBank    DeBank | The Web3 Messenger & Best Web3 Portfolio Tracker The real Web3-native messenger and the best web3 portfolio tracker that covers all your tokens, DeFi protocols, NFTs across all EVM chains.         DeBank    DeBank | The Web3 Messenger & Best Web3 Portfolio Tracker The real Web3-native messenger and the best web3 portfolio tracker that covers all your tokens, DeFi protocols, NFTs across all EVM chains.      Regarding the on/off ramp itself, we have only recently started the build, initially on the Celo chain, so we do not have any metrics to share yet. However, we will create a dune dashboard that will let people follow our on/off ramp flows to Optimism and see how these are tracking against the benchmark metrics laid out below.  How will receiving a grant enable you to further the mission of maximising the number of users interacting with Optimism? Please include a step-by-step flow of how you imagine this grant can lead to a greater number of user interactions with Optimism: Our grant proposal outlines a four-pronged approach to incentivise initial and repeat usage of Optimism, using incentivised fixed-rate farms and incentivised on-ramps. \u200b\u200bSpecifically, we will incentivise:  Optimism customer deposits on the Alluo mobile [30,000 OP] and web dApps [15,000 OP]   This means we will be able to both acquire deposits but also deploy that liquidity on various OP yield farms (using protocols such as Velodrome, Beefy and Synthetix to be begin with, depending on the rates being offered at the time) Our fixed rate farms guarantee a rate of return for 2 weeks (in line with our governance voting cycle) and provide real yield in the farm asset ($, \u20ac stablecoin, BTC and ETH) We will continue to provide the yield in the underlying farm asset but will also incentivise usage by also giving OP tokens to depositors   On-ramping to Optimism through the Alluo mobile app [60,000 OP]   This is our unique route to market for mobile-savvy retail customers Incentivising on-ramping will get them to try the app on the OP chain and access to the great rates and experience available to them on Optimism   On-ramping to Optimism through the Alluo web dApp [45,000 OP]   This will incentivise new liquidity to come and try out our App and Optimism, appealing to existing Alluo customers and new alike   On-ramping to Optimism through any other OP dApp that integrates with our white-label API onramp [100,000 OP]   This incentive will encourage other dApps to integrate with our payment API which will increase the ability for customers to onramp to Optimism Adding a completely new way to on and offramp to OP with a significantly improved UX across multiple dApps will set Optimism apart from its peers for user experience  Over 80% of incentives are proposed to go towards on-ramping to minimise the potential for Sybil attacks. These are made more difficult because we need the depositor\u2019s name, we\u2019ll get the incoming bank account or debit card used and we limit the maximum reward to $1000 for each depositor. So unless you are able to create lots of bank accounts easily, it will be hard for you to go around this. That said, we may choose to tweak the precise allocations once live depending upon customer appeal. This will be determined in conjunction with the grant counsel for any material changes. In combining this multi-faceted approach, we will target new on and off-chain customers, facilitate customer choice and give the greatest probability of success in growing user interaction with Optimism. In terms of flow of events: Firstly we will deploy our dApp, Liquidity Direction and fixed rate farms on Optimism and add incentives there. This will allow us to deploy existing capital sourced on Polygon and Ethereum and attract new deposits through the incentives. In parallel, we will enable incentivisation of the white-label API, so that once the payment API is built any dApp that integrates with it will be able to take advantage of the growth grant incentive. This includes Alluo; we will integrate the payment API and immediately incentivise on-ramping through the Alluo dApp, starting the flow of new off-chain customer deposits to OP. This enables a double incentive for those that have already put funds in the farm, to bring in more off-chain liquidity to earn additional OP rewards. Finally, we will deploy the mobile app on Optimism, incentivising both the on-ramp and the deposit. Most importantly, the mobile app channel will bring a completely different user-base to OP with the ability for us to actively market to them within the app (for example each week, customers get an alert showing what they earned during the last week and the app shows projected earnings, which provides additional incentives to deposit more). This opportunity is also why we have chosen to allocate more OP to this Alluo channel vs. the dApp. The reason this will be deployed and incentivised last is due to the complexity of the build (which we will entirely fund ourselves).  Tell us about the users you plan to target with this grant. Include any defining characteristics that will help you identify and target them.: We will be targeting users completely new to Crypto as well as Crypto natives. Through our mobile app, we have the ability to reach retail users looking for safe, sustainable rates on their fiat and those users looking for the convenience that a mobile app allows. Through our dApp and our white-label API onramp, we will target the crypto native looking for a better, more seamless Fintech-like UI. We have a set of four customer personas that we use to define customer characteristics. We will create, and fund, a supporting marketing campaign across various social media platforms, to raise awareness of the opportunities and incentives and to educate customers step-by-step on how to onramp and deposit into the various farms. We will also use the mobile app push messaging feature to re-target existing customers to increase their deposits in the new Optimism farms. As well as continuing to use the more passive weekly balance and projected earnings features of the app to provide additional incentives to deposit more.  How would these users interact with Optimism? For how long?: Optimism has proven it is a world-class chain with growth rates to back it up. However, if it is to bring millions more users to DeFi it needs access points and dApps that materially change the customer experience so users continue to choose Optimism time and time again. On ramps are the only access points to OP for customers and their liquidity and yet today the vast majority use centralised solutions with all the challenges they bring. As well as being centralised, they add unnecessary friction and stress to even well-experienced users. At Alluo, we create products that provide that change in customer experience, necessary to attract and maintain a high volume of users. We will enable customers to onramp to Optimism via the Alluo mobile and web dApp. We will enable customers to onramp to Optimism via any OP dApp that integrates with our white-labelled API ramp. We will deploy our \u2018DeFi on autopilot\u2019 fixed rate farms on OP enabling customers to go from fiat to farm in under 30 seconds - helping make OP the chain to bring DeFi to the masses. We will therefore step-change the first impression customers have on OP. We will increase the routes to accessing OP (and DeFi on OP) by introducing a mobile access point. We will improve the user experience of farming on OP and introduce opportunities to re-target users through our mobile app to increase repeat activity. The combination of the above will ensure customers remain for as long as customers can continue to access Defi in a fast and secure way on Optimism.

Regarding the on/off ramp itself, we have only recently started the build, initially on the Celo chain so it is too early for us to share metrics. However, we will create a dune dashboard that will let people follow our on/off ramp flows to Optimism.  Who are your competitors, are they on Optimism?: From an on/off-ramp point of view, there are a few widget providers like ramp.network, transak, moonpay, etc. but they don\u2019t focus on stablecoins and do not provide a white-label API to their services. Instead they constrain developers in using their widget and function much more like a centralised exchange in an iframe rather than a genuine on/off ramp white-label payment API. In terms of places to earn yield, Beefy, Velodrome and Synthetix are among some of the existing options on Optimism. However, they typically target more experienced users and we very much see a path to coexistence. For example, our plans include integrating our payment API into these protocols and putting strategies to our governance vote that deploy liquidity to their pools to help further grow users on OP overall.  What differentiates you from your competitors?:  End-user experience Fees Software developer experience  At Alluo we want to give end-users an experience that is on par with the best experience within the web2 space. When using the mobile or web dApps we want people to immediately feel at home and understand what to do even if this is the first time interacting with DeFi.  1600\u00d71035 257 KB  Users of the mobile app can sign up and create their own non-custodial wallet and deposit funds to start earning DeFi yields in under two minutes. Transactions are gasless for the end user and feel just like putting money in Fintech apps like Revolut, Venmo or Cash app. \u2018Alluo Pro\u2019 web-app users have a similar friction-free UX and can access more complex strategies otherwise out of reach to even experienced DeFi users, plus the option to have Alluo pay for gas if they wish. When going from Fiat to Crypto using the API payment gateway, we want an experience where people don\u2019t even realise that they are interacting with a different vendor, just like people ordering online will often interact with Stripe without ever realising that this is the case. We also enable smoother fiat to on-chain experiences, enabling someone to go from money in their bank account to providing liquidity in a pool earning rewards with just a few clicks. Similarly, we want the best user experience when it comes to ramp fees. Our objective is to have some of the lowest fees in the market from smaller (<100 Euro) to larger amounts (10k Euro+) where current providers only focus on one hand of the spectrum to the detriment of the other (e.g. MtPellerin is very competitive for <500 Euro transactions but quickly rises to 1.3% for larger transactions). Beyond card transactions, we will also offer direct bank-to-bank transactions with a twist in that each customer will have a separate account (vIBAN in Europe) which means that users will effectively be sending money to an account in their own name rather than in Alluo\u2019s or the Dapp\u2019s name - this is helpful because some banks in Europe have started to block transactions to crypto exchanges. In this case, those transactions will appear just like if the customer was sending money to themselves. Our focus on stablecoins rather than on a broader set of assets like most of the providers in the space should allow us economies of scale ensuring that we can consistently offer the lowest fees to our users. Finally, on the software developer side, for our payment API our ambition is to give developers an experience that is similar to Stripe, enabling builders to go from landing on our site to getting API keys and testing their first transactions within 5 minutes.  Please link to any code Audits (if any): N/A We have an ongoing bounty programme Bug Bounty Program - CRITICAL TIER \u00b7 Issue #16 \u00b7 GetAlluo/liquidity-direction-protocol \u00b7 GitHub with the following tiers:   Critical tier: $25k High: $5k Medium: $500 Low: $250  The bug bounty program has been live since day one and has been honored 3 times.  Team  Who are your founders?: Didier Baclin https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbaclin/ Remi Tuyaerts https://www.linkedin.com/in/remituyaerts/  - prior experience in Fintech (SME lending) - exited his previous startup before Alluo  What makes your team well-positioned to accomplish your goals described in this proposal?: Ten members of the Alluo team have previously worked together, with proven ability to build businesses from scratch. There is a significant breadth and depth of relevant experience across blockchain, banking, fintech, consumer retail and consulting - both in startups and FTSE 100 companies alike. Didier Baclin: Prior experience as CEO/CPO in Fintech/Banking (SME and Consumer lending) scaling lending to $100m+ and getting a UK bank licence. This experience is highly relevant given the need to work effectively with payment partners in a highly regulated environment which is something he has done for years. Remi Tuyaerts: Prior experience in Fintech founded and scaled an SME lender (to $50m+). This experience is highly relevant given the need for him and the tech team to build the right technology infrastructure which is compliant but also delivers best in class experience for users. Bivu Das https://www.linkedin.com/in/bivu-das-17b4395/ Prior COO and CEO Fintech experience. Computer Science and Business Management education and extensive consulting and operational experience in Financial Services. Very experienced operating within a highly regulated environment in operations and management functions. Julia Shaer https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliashaer/ 15+ years in design and user experience for major brands, agencies and startups alike, with 10+ years in Fintech. World-class design is key to our proposition and Julia leads this for Alluo. She is passionate about fixing Web3 design and constantly raises the bar for customer experience in everything she touches. Alastair Preacher https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairpreacher/ Alastair has 20+ years of expertise in product across Fintech, Banking and Consumer Retail. His experience in creating products that customers love by solving complex problems and providing great customer experience through the use of tech is exactly the right mix to help us land our ambitious plans.  Is this your first Web3 project?: Alluo is our first web3 project as a team, but we have successfully built and scaled a Fintech lender together to over 50m+ of lending.  If not, what else have you built? (Share links, Github repository, or any other useful information.): Several of the team have worked together for over 5 years and the core team has founded and scaled an SME lender to $50m+.  Grant Request  What is the size of the grant request? (250k OP max): 250,000 OP  How do you justify the size of the grant? We are proposing to undertake a large build program that includes work across our own mobile and web dApps and also requires others to integrate the white-label payments API into their own web dApp. We will also fund a marketing campaign to promote and educate users to use the ramps and farms. We are forecasting $50m of TVL for 250,000 OP rewards. This represents a return of $200 for every OP given out. We believe that the grant we requested is proportional to the effort we will extend in building the solutions and the potential they will bring. The combined effect of these solutions will be greater than the sum of their parts and will enable us to fully capitalise on the build to maximise their impact on the Optimism ecosystem.  Roadmap and distribution plan  Describe in discrete steps how you will successfully implement your grant plan: Generally, we work in an agile way where we start from the outcome we are trying to drive and go backwards on what we need to accomplish to deliver the goal. In this case, our ambition will be to on/off ramp at least $50m within the next 12 months and accrue at least $25m in our farms. Whilst this may seem relatively low in comparison to the growth of some of the protocols, it is worth remembering that the primary source of most of this money is currently sitting in people\u2019s bank accounts so it means we will be bringing new users and money on chain rather than merely channelling funds from one chain to another. With this in mind, our plan to accomplish this project is in 3 parts:  Build  We have already started the white-label payment API given our recent Celo grant  with this in mind, the API structure of our on/off ramp is already well underway and will continue   As a sign of our positive intent towards Optimism, we have already started the necessary work to deploy our dApp on Optimism  The IbAlluo infrastructure is almost ready for us to start accepting crypto deposits The webapp design work has also been started and is about 60% complete However, the work to build the liquidity direction protocol and exchange remains unstarted We also will need to integrate the payment API into the dApp once ready   We have not yet done any work to migrate the Alluo mobile app to Optimism   Distribution  Payment API  As outlined in the builder grant we have also started conversations which will hopefully enable us to integrate with leading protocols on Optimism such as Velodrome, Synthetix, etc We hope to further strengthen tconversations through the builder grant and this growth grant As outlined in the builder grant, in some cases, we may offer to write the front-end code for these protocols ourselves to accelerate the integration timelines and ensure the best user-experience possible     Promotion  Building and incentivising alone will not allow us to achieve our ambitious goals We propose to create a coordinated marketing and education campaign to raise awareness and drive customers to our mobile and web dApp This will be across social media and run for the duration of our incentive    Please see the milestone section for a timeline of this.

Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving. Distribution should not include the sale of any tokens by the grantee or the use of tokens for compensation, protocol expenses, etc. :  Optimism customer deposits on the Alluo mobile and web dApps [45,000 OP (18% of request)] On-ramping to Optimism through the Alluo mobile app [60,000 OP (24% of request)] On-ramping to Optimism through the Alluo web dApp [45,000 OP (18% of request)] On-ramping to Optimism through any other OP dApp that integrates with our white-label API onramp [100,000 OP (40% of request)]  We will  Incentivise Alluo fixed-rate farm deposits from both mobile & web app with OP tokens [20% of request]   We will issue 50,000 OP tokens over a 16 week emissions schedule whereby we deploy 13.5% in week 1, ranging down to 2.7% in week 16 The full schedule is as follows:      Week OP Tokens     1 6,763   2 5,748   3 4,886   4 4,153   5 3,779   6 3,439   7 3,130   8 2,848   9 2,592   10 2,358   11 2,146   12 1,953   13 1,777   14 1,617   15 1,472   16 1,339     This incentivisation will allow us to offer market leading rates on the farms across the campaign We will deploy liquidity on blue-chip and Velodrome, Synthetic or Beefy pools encouraging new user participation and introducing fresh liquidity.   Incentivise on-ramping directly through the Alluo apps [60% of request]   We will provide 5% of the value of customer deposits to those that on-ramp to OP from fiat in both the Alluo mobile app or dAPP This will be capped at 100k OP for the mobile app and at $1000 per depositor This will be capped at 50k OP for the dAPP and $1000 per depositor This will incentivise new liquidity to come and try out our App and Optimism, appealing to existing Alluo customers and new alike   Incentivise on-ramping using the white-label API for ANY OP dAPP that integrates the white-label API on-ramp [20% of request   We will provide 5% of the value of customer deposits to those that on-ramp to OP from fiat via the white-label API integrations on other dApps This will be capped at 50k OP in total and $1000 per depositor and issued on a first-come-first-served basis This incentive will encourage other dApps to integrate with our payment API which will increase the ability for customers to on-ramp to Optimism Adding a completely new way to on and off-ramp to OP with a significantly improved UX across multiple dApps will set Optimism apart from its peers for user experience  Over 80% of incentives are proposed to go towards on-ramping to minimise the potential for Sybil attacks. These are made more difficult because:  We need the depositor\u2019s name We\u2019ll get the incoming bank account or debit card used We limit the maximum reward to $1000 for each depositor  So unless you are easily able to create lots of bank accounts (not usually true) it will be hard for you to circumnavigate this.  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative?:  Fixed rate farm deposits - 16 weeks On ramping to the dApp and mobile app - 12 weeks On ramping using the white-label payments API - 12 weeks   Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project throughout your work on the project. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: As with all predictions, it is always difficult to be 100% accurate but we have skewed the emissions so as to front end loaded, to ensure early awareness. Integration with the likes of Velodrome or Synthetix could increase volumes significantly in a very short timeframe. By End March (pre-grant)  Deploy liquidity capture on OP to show willingness, speed of delivery and appetite Start initial payment gateway build on Optimism Start Liquidity Direction for fixed rate farms on Optimism  Funds sourced on Optimism, polygon & mainnet can be routed to strategies on OP (e.g. Velodrome/synthetix or Beefy)   Start awareness campaign  By end April  Deploy Liquidity Direction on OP  By end June  Alluo mobile app migration to OP Integrate on and off ramp on dApp Integrate on and off ramp on mobile app API enabling the on/off ramping of USDC on Optimism for UK and EU based-customers is live in Beta and available through a few protocols deployed on optimism  End July  Payment API deployed on 3+ tier 1 Optimism dApps Geographical expansion to either one country in LATAM or Africa - note that every integration with a new payment partner requires us to do some additional development given that each local providers have their own custom interfaces (for instance SEPA in Europe and PIX in Brazil are not the same and require different payment partners) Beyond geographical expansion, we would also like to provide unique features for an on/off ramp such as the ability to call a set of smart contracts after the funds have been brought on chain, enabling the ability to go from money in a user\u2019s bank account to funds deployed in a liquidity pool in just 1 transaction (leveraging meta transaction and batched transactions to optimise user experience)  August to October  Continued awareness campaign fo new users Ongoing re-targeting of mobile app customers within app Further geographical expansion to either one country in LATAM or Africa - in general, our ambition will be guided by the customer needs as they arise in the optimism ecosystem and the ability for us to strike new partnerships with local payment partners      Month Monthly volume Cumulative     1 $6,000,000 $6,000,000   2 $10,000,000 $16,000,000   3 $4,000,000 $20,000,000   4 $2,000,000 $22,000,000   5 $1,500,000 $23,500,000   6 $1,500,000 $25,000,000     1600\u00d7845 142 KB  For a high resolution view please follow this link (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974996461987201024/1082297026320015411/OP_Growth_Grant_timeline.jpg)  Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards. Do not use distribution of the grant itself as a milestone: Critical milestone 1: Having our dApp live on Optimism to capture liquidity Critical milestone 2: Having our Liquidity Direction Protocol live on Optimism to direct liquidity captured on OP, Polygon and Ethereum mainnet to OP farms Critical milestone 3: Mobile app migrated to OP to capture customer deposits through the mobile app Critical milestone 4: API live and enabling the on/off ramping of USDC on optimism with best-in-class speed (ie <60 seconds from when funds are received), fees (<1% for bank transactions of any size) and ability for protocols to tailor the experience and look and feel the way they want to. Critical milestone 5: Having our API integrated in production with at least 5 different protocols on Optimism - this will demonstrate our ability to build partnerships with protocols and showcase the superior experience we aim to create for both end-users and developers.  If the OP tokens are for direct distribution to users, why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: Our customer-centric product makes it easy and friction-free to access great Optimism DeFi yields from boh our mobile and dApp. When combined with the new payment API the user experience will be second to none. Customers will be able to onramp directly from their bank account to yield farms and over time we will introduce the ability to link existing debit cards to their farm position so that it immediately withdraws money when funds dip between a minimum threshold. Our integration on Optimism will deliver real-world improvements in money management to tens of thousands of users and this will persist way beyond the initial incentivised trial period. Moreover, our target customer base for the mobile app are those that want DeFi on auto-pilot. A key USP of the proposition is the set-and-forget nature and so are very much planning for longer-term time horizons than the usual degen yield farmer. This makes the liquidity on our platform sticky here for the long run.  Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organisational wallet addresses, etc.): Optimisim Safe: Safe  Optimism Relationship  Does your project solve a problem for the Optimism ecosystem? If so how?: Providing retail customers with a simple, easy route to earning great DeFI yields on Optimism direct from mobile and dApp, with a Fintech-like UX, will step-change the volume of customers and liquidity interacting with dApps on the chain. Furthermore, by providing a white-label payment API is a core feature to lower the bar for everyday people to transact on Optimism. This, in turn, could enable a broader range of use cases to be developed on Optimism, particularly real-world applications where interfaces with more traditional payment methods are necessary. We believe that it is still difficult for new users to get funds on optimism today - particularly if they are not familiar with Centralised exchanges and bridges. We believe that a \u201cnative\u201d experience that feels like web2 but gets funds on chain and deployed into protocols on Optimism (including Alluo) is one of the key ways to grow the ecosystem. Similarly, the ability for people to easily get funds back off-chain should also limit any fear that people might have going on-chain in the first place. Often, people will want to make sure they can get their money out before committing larger sums on chain.  Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: We believe bringing new users and money to the Optimism ecosystem is fundamental to its long term sustainability - we would love for Optimism to be the first chain that tens of thousands of new to chain people interact with for the first time.  Is your project Optimism Native?: No  Confirmations  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes  I understand that I will be expected to follow the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",
