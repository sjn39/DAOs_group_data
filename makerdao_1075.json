Paragraph Summary The Lending Oversight Core Unit supports the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES-001) MKR Budget structure discussed here. This is a 3-year vesting plan with 1-year cliff vest. Overall, this proposal would commit a maximum of 1,292.28 MKR to LOVE-001 contributors, covering MKR compensation for the Core Unit from its inception. This is approximately 63.47 MKR/ FTE/ year. Contributors do not forfeit their vesting upon leaving LOVE, providing that their departure is a smooth transition and there have been no serious ethical breaches. The LOVE Core Unit Facilitator has been working under the incubation program of SES since January 1 of 2022. The Facilitator of this Core Unit will take that as the start date for their vesting schedule. One Core Unit contributor is expected to be hired during the formal submission, and voting phase of this MIP. They will use the start of the Feedback Period of this MIP (May 8, 2022) as the start date for their vesting schedule.  Parameters     Property Value     MKR/USD Lock-in Price (1-Jan-22)MKR/USD Lock-in Price (8-May-22) $2,832$2,192   MKR Price Floor (1-Jan-22)MKR Price Floor (8-May-2022) -30%($1,982)-30% ($1,534)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 1 year   Vesting Schedule After cliff has expired, biannual MKR vesting   Vesting Interval 6 months   Manual Repricing yes   Auto-Renewal yes   MKR Expenditure Cap (Annual) 430.76 MKR   MKR Expenditure Cap (Total 3-Year) 1,292.28 MKR    The MKR Expenditure Cap included in the table above covers the total vesting schedule of 3 years for the projected 4.0 FTEs, including raises and repricing.  Current Estimated MKR Expenditure The Estimated MKR Expenditure is our best guess of how much MKR will be used with the current team configuration with 2.0 FTEs - with the highest seniority. This would result in the vesting schedule below:     Vesting Date MKR Amount     H1 2023 221.95   H2 2023 110.97   H1 2024 110.97   H2 2024 110.97   H1 2025 110.97   Total 665.84     On average, this would yield 110.97 MKR per FTE per year; this level is skewed by the elevated seniority of the current members - with the CU at full-capacity, average MKRs per head would amount to 63.47 Any changes to these amounts will be reported in our Monthly Budget Statements and reviewed by the budget auditors.  Reasons why the Actual MKR Expenditure could rise closer to the MKR Expenditure Cap:  New hires A compensation raise for a member of the team Repricing (and resetting) the program, in the case of bear market Price floor: -30%. If any Contributor chose to reprice their program, they could do it at a maximum of -30% from the set MKR price.   Budget Implementation This payment implementation is based on the SES MKR budget proposal.  Payment of the MKR tokens will follow the same flow as described in the original LOVE MIP40c3-SP71 DAI budget.   1330\u00d7164 6.8 KB   As defined above and in MIP40c3-SP71, the Monthly Budget Statement will contain the MKR vesting schedule. This schedule specifies when in the future MKR is vesting, and how much. To keep the risk acceptable for Maker governance as well as for the team, the MKR is moved from the protocol to the contributors in stages:  Following the MKR vesting schedule, any MKR that is vesting in 6 months or less, will be included in the top-up transaction which is added to the executive vote. This will move the MKR from the protocol to the LOVE-001 Auditors Wallet, which then acts as an escrow wallet. Following the MKR vesting schedule, after review and approval by the auditors, any MKR that is vesting in 3 months or less, will be included in the monthly top-up transaction that moves funds from the LOVE-001 Auditors Wallet to the LOVE-001 Operational Wallet. When the MKR has vested, it is paid out to the contributor, either directly or through an intermediate payment processor.   Any excess MKR in the LOVE-001 Auditors Wallet or the LOVE-001 Operational Wallet will be returned to the protocol, following the monthly payment transactions.  This payment implementation makes no assumptions about the origin of the MKR. It can either be moved from the protocol\u2019s treasury, newly minted, or obtained from another source. The MKR that\u2019s held by the LOVE-001 Auditors Wallet and the LOVE-001 Operational Wallet will not be used for voting, signaling, or any other type of governance participation. It will remain in the wallets untouched until it moves to the next step in the process. LOVE-001 may consider alternative payment flows compliant with DssVest if the standardized flow is compatible with the vesting schedule and that the risk is deemed acceptable by the team.

To put it in perspective, this is about the same as 1 FTE in Risk + 1 FTE in Oracles. In fact, I think this is more than 150% the MKR any non-engineering core unit gets. At the very least, I feel that asking for more than proven, established core units like Risk and Oracles and Growth and GovAlpha and DUX and SES should come with some milestones to be met. Any chance of lowering the total amount or adding some significant deliverables to get it? ",

It is expected that the professionals joining the CU will get a pay cut of 50%+ vs their market value, at current valuation, and it is my belief as a potential facilitator that this gap should be bridged not by immediate DAI compensation but rather by future economic growth, subject to long term vesting schedules. In any case, I\u2019ll work with SES and Strategic Finance on benchmarking this MKR allocation vs the other core units as suggested. Thanks a lot for your input, Luca ",

The number represents the CU\u2019s annualised cost base after having reached maximum capacity, including all customary contingency buffers.  Paragraph Summary LOVE-001 intends to support the DAO in its evolution, by facilitating the sustainable onboarding of tens (or hundreds) of billions of more complex use cases. LOVE-001 will do this by developing state-of-the-art frameworks for internal checks and balances, acting as an additional line of defense within the DAO, and helping to educate the community.  Specification  Motivation To support the ongoing operations of LOVE-001 and sustain its contributors as outlined in MIP39c2-SP33, the Lending Oversight Core Unit proposes the following budget cap.  Core Unit ID LOVE-001  Budget Implementation  1319\u00d7680 67.6 KB  The budget implementation will follow standard best practices as recommended by the SES Core Unit and will involve a setup with an Auditor wallet and an Operational Wallet which will be topped up on a monthly basis with a 3-month runway. The budget cap will be streamed from the protocol to the Auditor Wallet to reduce as much as possible the overhead for Maker governance. The LOVE-001 budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the Core Unit. Provide the protocol control over funds held in the Auditor Wallet. Reduce governance overhead to a minimum. Provide full transparency and be kept in check by a group of trusted auditors.  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  Streaming the annual budget for LOVE using DssVest for 1 year. A continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism    Multi-sig Wallets The following multi-sigs are involved:   The Auditor Wallet \u2014 A nested, 2-out-of-2 Auditor multi-sig, composed of 1-out-of-2 role based multi-sigs as signers. The Auditor Wallet will have 2 roles defined for its signers: Auditors and Accountants. The Accountant Role Multi-sig will have 2 signers \u2014 both SES permanent team contributors. The Auditor Role Multi-sig will also have 2 signers, also both SES permanent team contributors. SES will conduct the monthly auditing process as described in the Monthly Top-up Cycle, increasing transparency of the auditing process for the community. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will be listed as a beneficiary on the Auditor Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the Auditor Multi-sig wallet, ensuring control over these funds and acting as a backup. This multi-sig will hold funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap in DAI and receive the DssVest stream. All funds pass through this wallet before any are sent to the Operational Wallet.   The Operational Wallet \u2014 One wallet for LOVE-001 operational expenses. This is a 2-out-of-2 multi-sig. Signers include the LOVE-001 Facilitator and a trusted community member, @AES - Strategic Finance Core Unit Facilitator. The Maker Protocol (MCD_PAUSE_PROXY, 0xBE8E3e3618f7474F8cB1d074A26afFef007E98FB) will also be listed as a beneficiary on the LOVE-001 Operational Wallet. This allows the protocol to withdraw up to 1B DAI from the LOVE Operational Multi-sig wallet, acting as backup access to these funds.    Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, LOVE will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditor Wallet with the following sections:   Previous Month Actuals \u2014 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended.  Budget Forecast \u2014 A forecast of the Dai amount required to maintain a 3-month operational runway for the team based on the latest available information.  MKR Vesting Overview \u2014 A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transactions  The required DAI amount sent from the Auditor Wallet to the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway as indicated in the Budget Forecast section. Any excess DAI amount above the 3-month forecast in the Operational Wallet that will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    The Monthly Budget Statements can be found in this GitHub repository.  Monthly Top-up Cycle   Monthly Budget Statement Submission \u2014 Within the first 5 days of the month, LOVE-001 submits the Monthly Budget Statement to the Auditor Wallet signers. This report is also available for the rest of the community to review.   Transaction Requests Submission \u2014 In parallel, LOVE-001 submits the necessary transaction requests for the Auditor Wallet signers to sign:  DAI Top-up Transaction \u2014 One DAI transaction for the Operational Wallet that adds enough funds to the Operational Wallet to replenish the forecast 3-month runway. Only applies if the Operational Wallet balance is below this forecast.    Returning Excess Funds \u2014 LOVE-001 creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2014 One DAI transaction for Operational Wallet that has a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    DssVest Pull \u2014 The Auditor Wallet signers will pull available funds from the LOVE-001 DssVest contract, replenishing the available funds in the Auditor Wallet.   Auditors\u2019 Review \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers review the Monthly Budget Statement. First, Accountant Role signers will review the initial report submitted by LOVE-001 to ensure data accuracy and report completeness. A consistent audit checklist will be followed. The Auditor Role will then receive the Accountant\u2019s report generated from the checklist, and verify the Accountant\u2019s findings. A summary of each audit cycle\u2019s report will be made available to the Maker Community at the conclusion of the audit cycle on the LOVE-001\u2019s transparency reporting repository on Github.   Transaction Approvals \u2014 Upon acceptance of the Monthly Budget Statement audit, an Accountant Role signer and an Auditor Role signer will sign the requested transactions, sending the DAI top-up amounts to the LOVE-001 Operational Wallet.   Auditor Wallet Returns \u2014 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here, will return the excess DAI directly to the Surplus Buffer. As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.

Configure required confirmations as 2-out-of-2.   Transactions   Initial Seed Transfer 410,000 DAI will be transferred to 0xd07dF2054DFa094351dBe1aACfe59A8760750eD9 on 2022-07-06. This seeds the Operational Wallet to 3x the Month Budget Cap. This also initially funds the Auditor Wallet to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The initial transfer funds the Operational Wallet, enabling the Core unit to begin operations. This also then positions DssVest to begin streaming funds up to the Quarterly Budget Cap each month in the Auditor Wallet.   DssVest Stream A total of 984,000 DAI will be streamed to 0xd07dF2054DFa094351dBe1aACfe59A8760750eD9 starting 2022-07-01 and ending 2023-6-30. (984,000 DAI is calculated as Quarterly Budget Cap x 4 = $ 246,000 x 4).    Budget Breakdown The yearly budget cap request for the Lending Oversight Core Unit is 984,000 DAI. This equates to a monthly budget cap of c. 82,000 DAI to support the Core Unit\u2019s mandate. This amount is intended to support the CU when at its maximum capacity of 4-5 FTEs (the number will depend on their effective seniority), cover potential additional expenses for external legal and audit consultancy (of both the CU itself and of the monitored activity), as well as provide limited allowances for travel and administrative costs. The amount includes customary contingency buffers. The ramp up of the core unit will be managed with the maximum prudence, and therefore it is expected that Lending Oversight Core Unit could ultimately spend less than what anticipated. Should the Lending Oversight Core Unit be discontinued, all unused funds will be returned to the Maker Protocol.  1340\u00d7514 91.9 KB   Budget Details  Headcount Costs Headcount-related costs constitute c. 80% of the unit\u2019s total costs. Lending Oversight will be constituted only by finance professionals with a proven track record in the areas of structured lending, investment banking, commercial banking, and risk management. With time, the core unit intends to attract some of the brightest, and best educated, professionals across the globe. In order to do so, the core unit intends to maintain itself competitive in offering cash salaries that are, although not necessarily at market, attractive when also considering the incredible upside that working for a protocol like Maker can have, as well as the significant uncertainty that a professional would expose herself to. Lending Oversight wants to be skewed towards seniority, with a Facilitator with at least 10-15 years of experience at the highest levels of finance and banking. The other members of the team will be of diverse seniority, but with at least 3-5 years of experience following high-level superior education. An allowance to cover employment and insurance costs, as well as travelling, has been considered.  Admin Expenses Admin expenses represent c. 5% of the total cost base, and are constituted by allowances to cover gas and transaction fees, hardware and software costs, as well as professional services. The Professional Services budget covers potential consultancy and auditing costs. Although these will be kept to a minimum, a need for these may arise as the Lending Oversight CU is expected to oversee other units in their duties, with a particular focus on any activity that generates an exposure to off-chain legal and credit risk. The remaining 13% of the total cost base is constituted by a non-specified customary contingency buffer, that is expected to be returned to the protocol at the end of each month if it is not utilized according to the budget implementation above.

                    "content": "A while back, @SES-Core-Unit has posted an update on our changed direction for the Incubation Program, given the current budget constraints for MakerDAO. In this context we mentioned a budget-neutral approach to prevent MakerDAO budget increases when new core units are ratified throughout periods of falling revenues:    What Core Units does the DAO need next?   We are also working on budget transfers that would reduce the financial impact on the DAO even further if needed. This includes a budget-neutral approach, which would stay within the already approved limits of the SES budget, resulting in a net-zero increase for the protocol upon graduation of the new core units. As such we can continue to protect MakerDAO\u2019s moats and increase its competitive advantage.   Now, we want to apply this to the LOVE core unit ratification.  Net Zero Budget Increase for MakerDAO The goal is to take the monthly budget cap for the new core unit out of the already approved SES Incubation Program budget, rather than allocate an additional budget. As such, ratification of the core unit will result in a net-zero budget increase for MakerDAO. These are the numbers for the LOVE-001 proposal:   The monthly budget cap for the SES Incubation Program is currently 250,000 DAI.   The requested LOVE-001 monthly budget cap is 82,000 DAI.   If the LOVE core unit MIP40 passes, SES will reduce its Incubation Program budget cap to 250,000 DAI - 82,000 DAI = 168,000 DAI / month.   We hope this will allow voters to focus on the added value of the presented core unit and evaluate it for what it is, rather than having their hand forced by the current budget concerns. ",

I\u2019m imagining that we would still ask PE to set-up a DAI stream to the LOVE auditor wallet and we will then organise a budget return from the SES auditor wallet of the balance of payments? Effectively reducing the SES budget stream. Or would the idea be that we don\u2019t setup a stream for LOVE and instead transfer funds from the SES auditor wallet to the LOVE auditor wallet and distribute the DAI that way? And finally, will this be reflected in ongoing SES budget proposals or will it only apply to the current outstanding SES budget? ",

Patrick_J:  I\u2019m imagining that we would still ask PE to set-up a DAI stream to the LOVE auditor wallet and we will then organise a budget return from the SES auditor wallet of the balance of payments? Effectively reducing the SES budget stream.   Yes, indeed. SES will be returning the excess budget to the protocol as usual.

No.     Patrick_J:  And finally, will this be reflected in ongoing SES budget proposals or will it only apply to the current outstanding SES budget?   The commitment we\u2019re making will ultimately be reflected in the next MIP40 update. When it will be submitted is still unclear because it will require a complete rewrite with the new standard.

Appreciate that it can be tricky to find the right info on the forum sometimes, I think this is the thread you\u2019re looking for:     MIP39c2-SP33: Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) Formal Submission   MIP39c2-SP33: Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001)  Preamble MIP39c2-SP#: 33 Author(s): @luca_pro Contributors: @wouter, @Juan, @Retro Tags: core-unit, cu-love-001, mandate Status: Formal Submission Date Proposed: 2022-05-11 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Forum URL: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip39c2-sp33-adding-lending-oversight-core-unit-love-001/15098 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmWYajMq   Sentence Summary MIP39c2-SP33 adds the Lending Oversight (LOVE-001\u2026     In particular: \" Strategy Onboarding use cases that aren\u2019t yet (fully) part of the world of smart contracts, or complex use cases in general, comes with a new set of challenges that have sparked wider questions about Maker\u2019s role within the wider monetary and lending stack. In this context, LOVE-001 would be instrumental to make the Vision just described real. The initiatives that would be required to do so would constitute the Strategy of the CU:   Initiative 1: Develop, document, and maintain a high-level and accessible framework to approach new complex collateral sets.  Initiative 2: Set (or help setting) all control frameworks for the internal teams involved, as well as a suggested code of conduct.  Initiative 3: Act as a second line of defence within the DAO for the onboarding, monitoring, and management of those assets.  Initiative 4: Educate and communicate with other CUs and the broader community.\"  ",

We could definitely have a dedicated AMA if needed, but in the meanwhile I think the MIP39 you have pointed out is the best representation of LOVE\u2019s mission. Together with SES, we have designed and fine tuned LOVE\u2019s role and responsibilities over the last few months as part of the incubation program, and I guess both the proposed mandate and set of practical responsibilities shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to everyone who has collaborated with me personally over the last months.
