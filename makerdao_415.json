The bridge built in Phase I (GitHub repository) has been audited by ChainSecurity (see audit report). Risk and implementation details of the new phase proposed are explained further in this post: StarkNet wormhole implementation details.  Paragraph Summary The StarkNet Engineering Core Unit has produced the deliverables for Phase I as detailed in MIP39C2-SP19: the L1 and L2 contract (bridge code), the governance upgradeability mechanism, the DAI bridge limit, and proper documentation of the code. The deployment will happen in January when events are available on StarkNet, and when we have integrated StarkNet\u2019s bridge interface. StarkNet Engineering Core Unit is proposing a next phase for a requested budget of $487,292. The budget is split 50/50 between Maker and StarkWare, as was the case in MIP40c3-SP28: StarkWare will also fund $487,292. The total budget of Phase II is $974,583. The deliverables are fast withdrawals L2->L1 and L2<>L2 teleportation. The approach is detailed in this forum post. The scope of the next phase follows the Wormhole design developed by Protocol Engineering (PE-001): Introducing Maker Wormhole.  Specification  Motivation The Wormhole design will make DAI easy to move across domains that have an official Maker bridge, as well as MCD vat and other Wormhole-related contracts. The Wormhole design covers both L1->L2 fast withdrawals and L2<>L2 teleportation. Protocol Engineering (PE-001) and Oracle (ORA-001) have started working on fast withdrawals for EVM-compatible chains and expect to deliver L2->L1 fast withdrawals in Q1 2022, and L2<>L2 teleportation in Q2 2022. StarkNet Engineering (SNE-001) submits this subproposal to develop the necessary components for fast withdrawals and teleportation on StarkNet. Our delivery timeline will track as much as posssible that of PE-001 working on optimistic rollups (ORs). We expect to deliver one or two months after the development on ORs. Before fast withdrawals are deployed, Risk (RISK-001) will propose bridge limits and debt ceilings (see the Risk section of the associated post).  Core Unit ID SNE-001  List of Budget Implementations  Due to the predictability and regularity of costs, this budget implementation is a Simple Budget Implementation under MIP40c4.

Bug Bounties allow us to support whitehat involvement in the work we do. Payout amounts will be assessed and determined by the team. This amount is only covering a minimal bug bounty. A broader bug bounty with a larger budget will be organized with Protocol Engineering (PE-001) and Oracles (ORA-001) to cover the wormhole design as a whole. We might leverage Immunefi Security (IS-001) in case it is approved by governance  Gas cost: $12,500. Rough estimate, based on gas cost needed by other Core Units, taking into account the scope of phase I  Audit: $125,000. We will work with a firm familiar with Cairo (e.g., ChainSecurity, or Peckshield)  Travel: $5,000. It covers travel to conferences to meet and work in person with PE-001 and ORA-001  ",

                    "content": "Thank you @flipflopflapdelegate , see in-line answers to your questions: Q: Can you please provide color on how you have been providing tailored training and resources to the Community Devs (PE) on StarkNet secure smart contract development best practices? Like, have you provided workshops to outline and educate the unique aspects of the StarkNet security landscape? A: Some elements below that are beyond the fact that Starkware provided a month of training to our team (for free), and beyond the documentation of the code. During phase I, the main audience we have focused on transferring knowledge to is the Protocol Engineering Core Unit. We have had weekly checking with them where we discussed the security details of Starknet. We also have had multiple L2 deepdive calls and in-person meetings in Lisbon. In December we are planning on doing a detailed code walkthrough as well as a Risk review with PECU to go through the specificities of Starknet in the context of the wormhole design. During phase II, we will also include the Oracle CU and Data CU in our target audience. We will be working with them on the wormhole oracle implementation on Starknet and the wormhole Risk Dashboard. Q: Also, your bug bounty seems pretty light\u2013is this an internal bounty? A:  It is an external bounty. Keep in mind that the numbers you see are 50% of the total item cost (the other 50% is paid for by Starkware). However I hear that a related MIP will be posted about this before the deadline tomorrow. I will update once I have understood the scope of that MIP and how it relates to our bounty. Thanks for flagging. Q: And last but not least, will your team eventually format an incident and emergency response services, crisis communications and public relations support, compliance risk management, etc.? Trying to get an idea of what our expectations should be  A: Incident and emergency response in the context for the wormhole will not be Starknet specific, but the action taken might be. We discussed in the last cross-CU L2 call that Maker should have a wormhole risk dashboard that\u2019s monitoring all the domains. However, our team will be responsible for incident response should Starknet be fully or partly the source of an incident. We will think through during phase II how our CU will have to transition from being builders-only to being operators and builders. Regarding public relations support: Starkware PR team will support joint announcements. The first one will be end of January/early February for the bridge announcement. Regarding crisis communications: Good question. It is very hard to commit to actions ahead of something happening here. Though, the reason why we have a CU that is funded 50/50 and relatively independent from Starkware is to assure that those scenarios are handled in a way that\u2019s efficient and fair for both sides. Both sides would have a lot to lose should this not be handled properly and our CU would work with both sides to take action. Regarding Compliance risk management: Would you have something, or a scenario that is more precise in mind here? Nothing has been discussed to the extent of my knowledge. In case liabilities come our way in relation to the wormhole, I would make the same comment as for the crisis communication, both sides have a lot to lose, and our CU will work with both sides to come up with the best mutually beneficial approach. Q:  EDIT: The Audit expense also seems light\u2013is this an internal audit, or will you outsource to say, OpenZepelin, TrailBits, etc.? I ask because those folks range around $25-$45K per week. A: Note that the budget you see is 50% of the budget for each item. But I am collecting internal benchmark on a work of a similar scope from PECU. I might update this line item if it makes sense. Thanks for flagging. ",
