                    "content": "As part of GovAlpha\u2019s quarterly goals, we are investigating applying \u2018impact\u2019 estimations to active governance items (MIPs and Signal Requests). The goal of these estimations is to:  Provide delegates, core unit members and the wider community with an idea of how important it is that they pay attention to a given governance item given limited time. Provide a clear path of escalation for reviews within GovAlpha (i.e. if a newer member of the CU reviews something they think should have a \u2018high\u2019 impact score, it can be escalated to a member with more experience.)  Initially, impact estimations will have a single dimension, giving GovAlpha\u2019s estimate on the magnitude of the impact a given governance item will have on the Maker Protocol and MakerDAO. We will apply a simple \u2018low\u2019 \u2018medium\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 impact score to active governance items for the next few months, and see if this system is effective and well-received among the community.  What goes into an impact estimation? Impact estimates will be just that, an estimate which will depend on the person making it, and the specific situation surrounding a governance item. That said, we will be following these guidelines when we look to create these estimations. Likely High Impact  Anything that adds concretely identifiable risk to the Maker Protocol will likely be marked as high impact. Anything the DAO is doing for the first time is likely to be marked as high impact. Anything that removes a non-trivial amount of money from the surplus buffer will likely be marked as high impact. Core Unit onboarding and offboarding will likely be marked as high impact. Anything that permanently changes governance processes or structures within MakerDAO will likely be marked as high impact.  Likely Medium Impact  Items that may lead to later decisions that add risk or deplete the surplus buffer will likely be marked as medium impact. Anything that removes a trivial amount of money from the surplus buffer will likely be marked as medium impact.  Likely Low Impact  Minor wording changes and/or fixes to existing MIPs will likely be marked as low impact.  Finally, If there is any doubt about a given estimation, we will round up rather than rounding down. These guidelines are not meant to be exhaustive, but are meant to:  Give the community an idea of what they can expect when looking at an impact estimation. Give members of GovAlpha an idea of what we should be keeping in mind when making impact estimates on a given governance item.  We do expect that many governance items will be given a \u2018high impact\u2019 estimation. However, we feel that this is a worthwhile experiment, even if relatively few proposals are filtered out. We expect to expand these guidelines as we get a greater experience applying estimates.  Where will we see this?  774\u00d7152 15.1 KB  GovAlpha will initially be adding impact estimation tags to forum posts that represent RFC MIPs and Signal Requests and will also be including these tags within the governance tracker spreadsheet. In the future, and assuming these estimates are met positively, we will work with @dux-core-unit in an attempt to integrate these into the voting portal as well.  Disclaimer We\u2019re not infallible, use these estimates as a guide and not as a source of truth. If you have input on any specific estimate, feel free to bring it up in discord or in the relevant forum thread. In most cases (at least to start with) we will escalate impact estimates if requested by a member of the community. You remain responsible for any actions you take on the basis of these estimates.
