But I was thinking, wouldn\u2019t it be cool to experiment with both in parallel? When Liquidations 2.0 is deployed, instead of disconnecting liquidations 1.x, MakerDAO could deploy a contract that load balances between liquidations 2.0 and 1.x modules. Pros:  Diversity of price discovery mechanisms Experiment to see which one gets better collateral prices More options for auction participants Framework for additional liquidation modules in the future Can remove an under-performing liquidation module at any time  Cons:  Additional development and maintenance (load balancer and front-end) Additional governance overhead (2 sets of parameters to manage) Potential confusion of auction participants  What do you think?     Yes, experiment with both liquidation mechanisms in parallel Sounds interesting, but not sure if it\u2019s worth the complexity Not sure, need more information No, too complex No, too confusing Abstain     0 voters     This is just an informal poll, but I\u2019ll leave it open until at least Saturday, August 29th, 2020.
