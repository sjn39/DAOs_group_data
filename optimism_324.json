After following the carnage in today\u2019s market with the potential FTX meltdown and all the negativity that comes with it, it might be a great counter move to do a second airdrop now (in the very near future). OP has built some really nice momentum the last couple of weeks/months, with some great development and rapidly expanding its community/user base. To keep this going it would be a really smart move to reward the community with a little \u201cgift\u201d, especially at times like this. I am fully aware of the fact that I have no clue what is going on behind the scenes and know nothing about any plans of future airdrops. Thus this is only a suggestion from my side. Peace out. And don\u2019t keep your coins on exchanges. Always remember - Not your keys, not your coins. ",
