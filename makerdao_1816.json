While Filecoin launched its own independent blockchain, a competing provider, Swarm, is closely integrated with Ethereum. For example, Swarm\u2019s token BZZ is backed by DAI. The PSM is now available on the Swarm network. Tested an approval and exchange. Also, the Swarm-based video hosting site Etherna will host Devcon videos this year. ",

If Maker acted intelligently it would greatly reward integrations like this, for instance with a grant to run more decentralized front ends or collateral onboarding. The same goes for the relationship with Gnosis \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for us, are we there for them now that they\u2019ve applied for a Vault? Dai\u2019s integrations are the only reason it continues to have market share. We should ignore this at our own peril. ",

However, I am hopeful that IF the Endgame does get approved by MKR token owners\u2013such necessity will finally come into fruition, and some of these platforms/protocols will be Ecosystem Actors that will be bidding to build front-ends for MetaDAOs. This process of cross-building, buying & selling between organizational units already exists in the real-world. ",
