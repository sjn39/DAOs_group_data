This wallet has already received 510k DAI from the DAO as part of the April 2021 Governance Cycle executive vote. Per MIP40c1:  Multisig Address Protocol Engineering Core Unit Multisig: 0xe2c16c308b843eD02B09156388Cb240cEd58C01c  Multisig Purpose Holding funds to pay for Protocol Engineering Core Unit monthly expenses; including salaries, audits and other team expenses as approved and accounted for by the Core Unit Facilitator.  Governance Ownership Governance must be able to revoke funding and permissions from approved multi-sigs at any time - this can be verified by checking the spending limit section here while noting that the DSPauseProxy contract is allowed to withdraw all funds.  Multisig Signors This multisig has 6 signors and requires at least 2 to release funds. The required threshold may be increased once we introduce automation. These signors are and will remain anonymous.  Point of Contact As the Protocol Engineering Core Unit Facilitator, @Derek is the point of contact for this multisig.  Succession If the current facilitator is removed from his/her position at any point, either by Governance or the Core Unit, a new sucessor will be onboarded and will replace his/her access to the multisig.
