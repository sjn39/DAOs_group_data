So here\u2019s my question: If all Dai is backed by eth, then shouldn\u2019t there be an easy way to send me back my Dai, considering the Dai I sent to curve contract won\u2019t ever be retrievable considering is a non-upgradeable contract. I have spent time talking with owner of curve and there\u2019s nothing they can do. If someone has any suggestions on how I go about writing up a signal request for something like this, I\u2019m more than willing to do so. However, and no doubt I\u2019m not shirking my own obvious user error, but this should be something that is available to Dai users. If contract is a known contract where money cannot be retrieved, then Dai loses nothing by trying to help us remedy our mistakes. Thanks guys. ",

There is a theoretical technical solution for this however it is not an easy fix and will require a fair amount of engineering work (we need to account for how DAI is calculated in the End contract in the event of emergency shutdown, a mechanism for redemption, a UI etc). In the long run, there may be even greater Governance overhead for managing and coordinating the process for DAI redemption. (also note that discussion to-date has only considered the DAI contract itself, not external contracts - which opens up new security considerations). As an existing backlog item of PECU, my recommendation is to leave it with us, noting however that it is not a priority wrt ongoing work as dictated by Governance, and sometime in Q2/Q3 I will work with the team to document the technical solution, after which Governance can begin discussing how to manage the overhead of pursuing this to then inform a subsequent signal and community decision.
