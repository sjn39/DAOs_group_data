You can find some of the original discussions around ranked choice voting on the original forum post here. We have not yet decided to move forward with Ranked Choice voting on any of the weekly polls and specially not the monetary policy polls. I personally would love to see this happen, so I want to put out a bit of a poll in order to start the conversation / gauge interest in using ranked choice voting for the weekly monetary policy votes.  Stability Fee Vote / Base Rate + Risk Premium Vote     Yes (Ranked Choice on all SF votes going forward) No (Continue with first past the post voting for SF going forward) Abstain     0 voters      DSR Spread Vote     Yes (Ranked Choice on all DSR spread votes going forward) No (Continue with first past the post voting for DSR spread going forward) Abstain     0 voters     FYI: First signal request. Hope I didn\u2019t screw it up too bad. If anyone has some suggestions on how I might improve the format next time feel free to DM me. ",

IMO the best solution would be to have ranked-choice votes for both the base rate and risk premium. Presumably later would presumably be voted on less frequently and may ultimately be derived by some quantitative model or the other, but I would think we are a ways away from that eventuality so ranked-choice voting will likely still make sense in the short term. That said, I sort of went with a compromise and just said SF since that in essence captures the intent here, and doesn\u2019t use yet to be implemented ideas / terminology. I could be convinced to reword the poll if we think it is necessary, but given that it has already seen some engagement I wouldn\u2019t want that to invalidate any previously cast votes on the topic since the difference IMO is a bit pedantic. Maybe Heart, DM me, or otherwise respond to this comment if you feel it is necessary. Depending on engagement there I could either add a second poll concerning base_rate / risk_premium or reword the original. ",

To be clear, I\u2019m generally very happy you made the signal request and I don\u2019t anticipate any major problems.   Don\u2019t give polls a fixed end date, you can\u2019t change it later, which is sometimes annoying if you want to extend the poll for reasons of participation, or to build more consensus.  Do include a statement at the end of the signal request as to what the next steps are. This is where you would put a suggested end date and/or leave room for extension.  Do Make polls multiple choice unless you are very sure it doesn\u2019t require it. In this case it\u2019s single choice, and in this case, that is completely fine.  Do summarise the pros and cons around making the change you are proposing in the initial post.  Edit: For reference I made a new post: Practical Guide to the Signaling Process ",
