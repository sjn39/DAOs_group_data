I\u2019m excited about a percentage based dao:   Decentraland \u2013 7 Dec 21    [DAO: QmVDiPm] Percentage based VP by 0x07356b0edf9b934330f41952b09d076c3810c608 (Bet)   Currently the circulating MANA supply is 1.3b VP  The LAND supply is 90,000 * 2,000VP = 180m VP  (minus roads, districts and plazas)  NAME supply is 31,000 = 3.1m VP  Wearables = 0 VP  My proposal...  Reading time: 1 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 2 \u2764       TLDR; A dao could be formed of: 50% ETH\u2026 50% DAI\u2026 Then a vote can be performed to add another asset: 50% ETH\u2026 25% DAI\u2026 25% STETH\u2026 Why? One user with $10 in ETH, DAI and STETH. Would have more voting power than 10 guys with $1m in ETH  I was wondering if anyone has seen anything similar. DMs are always open for discussions  ",
