You can browse the grants at https://gitcoin.co/grants.  wtf is qf? Gitcoin Grants is built upon Quadratic Funding (QF). (well, a variant of it if you want to be technical about it) Quadratic Funding is a math formula that dictates that we match crowdfunding contributions based upon the number of unique contributors, NOT the amount they contributed. Its not as complicated as it sounds.   In plain english, QF IS powerful because it can mean that, for the most popular grants, a very small crowdfund contribution will be matched by a lot from the matching pool.  TLDR - its a more democratic way of running a matching crowdfund. Learn more about quadratic funding here.  who are the funders this round?
