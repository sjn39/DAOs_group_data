                    "content": "I wanted to share a dApp prototype that @austingriffith & two of the BuidlGuidl builders built (Viraz + 0xDarni). This is a dApp that allows a user to stake GTC on Gitcoin Grants based on the Grant quality using Conviction Voting.   From there, Gitcoin Grants 1.0 (or 2.0) could then adjust the sort algorithm of the grants based on what grants GTC holders think is most valuable. Problems this dApp solves:  Allow GTC Holders to have governance utility with their GTC. Provide fairer starting conditions to the Gitcoin Grants rounds, so it does not become a horse race (where ppl get more contributions => higher matching => repeat)  Check out the demo of this conviction voting dapp.  It allows people to trustlessly stake GTC on their favorite grants, signaling their conviction about which grants are quality.       Roadmap from here  Audit the smart contracts Deploy on Optimism L2 Simplify the UX (If governance decides to) Adopt this data as part of the sorting algorithm on Gitcoin Grants.   Links:  Play with the demo yourself: https://gtc.v37.io/  Checkout the Github  Demo video What is conviction voting?   This was built in 3 days!  What can we learn from this? What I think is incredible about this prototype is that Austin + crew conceived + built this in 3 days! They didnt hire any fancy consultants.  They aren\u2019t spending $200k-300k/mo on software development.  This was just someone who cares about Gitcoin who chose to work backwards from an outcome + ship the software (and will probably be rewarded retroactively from Build Gulid/Gitcoin if/once this ships).  It\u2019s really inspiring to me! What can we learn from this type of rapid prototyping?  Can we sprinkle some of this culture in the Moonshot Collective + Gitcoin Product Group so that we can ship Grants 2.0 well before the overton window closes? IMO its existential to solve our software dev velocity problems.  We cannot continue to plow hundreds of thousands of dollars into software development that is neither fast, cheap, nor good.  Questions about priorities are only existential when it takes us 2-6 months to ship any new module.  If we could quickly ship slim MVPs it would be less of a zero sum \u201cmy priority vs yours\u201d between leaders. I am a strong advocate of focusing on minimum shippable increments.  This GTC Conviction Voting dApp is a great emergent example of that.  Prompts  How can we get more rapid prototyping juju (build guild culture) into MSC/GPG?  Daniele showed here that a steel thread for a small dApp takes 2-3 days if you have the right builder on a project/focused on outcomes. Do we want to support this conviction voting app as part of grants 2.0 roadmap?  ",

Funny I read this after shilling GIVpower in another forum post:    Roadmap to GTC Utility \ufe0f \ud83e\udd16 Meta-Governance       Giveth is doing something really interesting called \u201cGIVpower\u201d where people who lock GIV tokens can use their voting power to increase a project\u2019s ranking on the platform\u2026 We will use several data streams to create a projects ranking and each project\u2019s ranking effects the benefits we offer on the platform starting with the default sort on the platform and GIVbacks (and eventually GIVmatching and other cool things that we have waiting in the wings)  This would create a little bit of demand and ut\u2026     The hardest part is parameterizing it and communicating the impact of staking for longer to the user\u2026 In summary tho, that\u2019s why we came up with the idea of GIVpower\u2026 if you stake 100 GIV for 2 weeks\u2026 you get 100 GIVpower,  if you stake for 8 weeks = 200 GIVpower, if you stake for 128 weeks = 800 GIVpower, 200 weeks = 1000 GIVpower (scaling quadratically of course) Also, mStable had a similar approach and then THEY CHANGED IT!!!  I interviewed them about why (1 day of research will save 6 months of testing in prod):     Anyway, we have a bunch of designs and thoughts about how to do this\u2026 @0xDarni any interest in a sync?

E.g. you can get max 50x after 6 months, so:   you stake 5 GTC on a grant - on day one your voting power is worth 0   over time your voting power grows, and after e.g. 15 days it is now worth the full 5 GTC   after 6 months it reaches 250 (50x) - and it stops growing   At that point if you leave your tokens in, your voting power stays at 250 for that grant. If you un-stake there\u2019s a decay function so it doesn\u2019t go to 0 immediately. The multiplier and the duration we should decide. I have another call with him next week. I\u2019m on a trip in NY at the moment - back on Monday - but in the meantime I handed over a couple of optimisations in the subgraph model to @Viraz. Voting power will be calculated off-chain, so we will deploy to Mainnet soon  ",

If you ask me, then I\u2019d say long term an L2. Short term we could do L2, it just requires some work on the UX. The reason we went for Mainnet is that @austingriffith tried bridging to Optimism and it cost him 41 USD to transfer 1 GTC:  1788\u00d7306 38.5 KB  Presumably you\u2019d have to transfer back to L1 if you want to use the tokens for something else. On top of that right now the UX is not great - this thread explains what Austin had to do:   twitter.com   Austin Griffith @austingriffith  @dmihal I did it homie! That was a lot of work \ud83d\ude05  Go to https://t.co/PPRrnCAHhU and approve the bridge contract to take 1 * 10^18 GTC.

We can do anything  I think the decision in the end should be coming from you / the DAO. I am not aware of what the long term plans are for the token and L2 adoption. ",

There\u2019s a lot that we cannot measure, for example I would love to know how often the new sorting was used on gitcoin.co while the round was going. That said, we think it worked great. Some numbers:  23232 GTC still staked on Mainnet 4760 GTC still staked on Optimism about about 60% of the total  as of now Highest amount staked was about 50K GTC on Mainnet - Optimism has been stable 54 unique stakers across the two networks  So let me turn the question back to you, @owocki, and to the DAO: what would have to be true for us to use conviction voting as the default sorting method for next round?
