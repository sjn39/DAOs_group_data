As part of the cleanup and classification in the makerdao github I have assigned repositories to the Core Units that seems to work on them/have them in their mandate - and also marked a load of repositories for being archived. Next step is now to review with relevant core units. I will ask @Core-Facilitators to assign somebody on your team to review and comment if needed on the assignment/classification and answer any direct questions in the lists in this spreadsheet:  docs.google.com    20220926 Review- Classification &amp; Cleanup MakerDAO repositories and code...

Please review as soon as possible and no later than October 18, 2022. If I don\u2019t hear anything by then I will assume the assumptions in the list are correct.
