                    "content": "Much discussion has occurred informally and occasionally formally about the various legitimate reach and impact of US-based financial regulation on the crypto economy. While it is unlikely to be exciting reading, I think it\u2019s important for members who are able to continue to build out the theoretical framework around the Maker protocol, since it is so distinctly different from other sources of stablecoins. A few months ago, I posted some discussion about a paper making the rounds in policy and media circles, \u201cTaming Wildcat Stablecoins\u201d by Gorton and Zhang. My main conclusion at the time was that policy is being directed at DAI\u2019s competitors and not DAI itself. One possible mechanism for regulating stablecoins under current US law is again being whispered about as a low-effort way for the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to recommend regulatory action. Let\u2019s run through this specific mechanism, and why it would probably be a positive for Maker. As we all know, the US financial laws are a legal thicket that are complex to navigate. This is a problem not just for market participants, but for regulators and lawmakers. So deciding that an existing legal framework already exists often elicits a sigh of relief from those looking to patrol the regulatory perimeter. Gaining favor in some circles is the notion that an unrepealed section of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act \u2013 a Great Depression-era banking law \u2013 provides fairly clear prohibition against the acceptance of deposits by non-bank institutions. The text of the relevant portion, Section 21(a)(2): \u201cFor any person, firm, corporation, association, business trust, or other similar organization to engage, to any extent whatever with others than his or its officers, agents or employees, in the business of receiving deposits subject to check or to repayment upon presentation of a pass book, certificate of deposit, or other evidence of debt, or upon request of the depositor, unless such person, firm, corporation, association, business trust, or other similar organization (A) shall be incorporated under, and authorized to engage in such business by, the laws of the United States or of any State, Territory, or District, and subjected, by the laws of the United States, or of the State, Territory, or District wherein located, to examination and regulation, or (B) shall be permitted by the United States, any State, territory, or district to engage in such business and shall be subjected by the laws of the United States, or such State, territory, or district to examination and regulations or, (C) shall submit to periodic examination by the banking authority of the State, Territory, or District where such business is carried on and shall make and publish periodic reports of its condition, exhibiting in detail its resources and liabilities, such examination and reports to be made and published at the same times and in the same manner and under the same conditions as required by the law of such State, Territory, or District in the case of incorporated banking institutions engaged in such business in the same locality.\u201d Note the unlawfulness of \"receiving deposits subject\u2026to repayment\u2026upon the request of the depositor.\" This, of course, can through the eyes of US regulators, appear to fit fairly nicely on top of Tether, USDC, BUSD, USDP, GUSD, et al. Violations of this provision result in: (b) \u201cWhoever shall willfully violate any of the provisions of this section shall upon conviction be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and any officer, director, employee, or agent of any person, firm, corporation, association, business trust, or other similar organization who knowingly participates in any such violation shall be punished by a like fine or imprisonment or both.\u201d It is important to note that there are three exemptions to the illegality of taking demand deposits, all of which can be summarized as being subject to federal, state, territory, or district laws and regulations regarding the product. Right now, there is considerable lack of clarity at any level about how digital assets should be considered, but it likely means organizational headaches for the likes of USDC and Tether. Other stablecoins may or may not suffer less disruption, depending upon their structure and if they are already under specific regulations at the federal or state/territory/district level. As far as DAI is concerned, there are no deposits held by Maker that are subject to redemption promises. A user of the Maker protocol\u2019s software retains custody of their own collateral and any DAI is user-generated. This is naturally quite different from how fiat-backed stablecoins operate, and represent an example of how Maker both deserves a different regulatory touch, and in some circumstances may be likely to receive that. That difference supports my own assertion that Maker is not a lending protocol (leaving aside RWA for the moment), but a loan-guarantee protocol. Any claim the Maker protocol has on a user\u2019s collateral is more akin to a lien than anything else, with liquidation triggered by collateralization falling to unacceptable levels, but otherwise not interacting with the user\u2019s collateral at all. If Section 21 of the 1933 Glass-Steagall legislation does indeed become the primary method of regulating stablecoins in US markets, Maker could be well positioned to benefit. This is only one possible road that US regulation of the stablecoin space may take, but is a reassuring example of how DAI might emerge with a lasting competitive advantage under some regulatory outcomes.

                    "content": "Glad to see you sharing the thinking coming from your meetings @PaperImperium I agree in many ways DAI is not a redemption on anything except as a lein on collateral for a borrower.   Where this breaks down is in Emergency Shutdown but even then this \u2018lein\u2019 is satisfied by collateral, at least at the locked collateral price.  This could become an issue if backing collateral value changes - but there is no issue of the locked collateral not being available for redemption only that the value of it can change up or down relative to the expected value of the DAI.   This is a very different mechanic than any other product btw. A lot of other protocols are going to have issues here and the idea we could lose the DSR as a DAI sop up mechanism is interesting in the face of Impossible Trinity but not the end of the world for Maker.   Single Collateral DAI did fine without the DSR though SF did move from 0 to 20% in like 12-16 months\u2026 As to fixed rates.   We do not need any other protocol changes for governance to make an agreement for fixed rate vaults. Maker can take on \u2018reasonably termed\u2019 fixed rate risk (12months pretty easily I think).  Anything beyond 3 years I think is hazardous to the protocol.   All this does is reduce potential income\u2026 Because of the multiple issues here I am really turning to a no vote on anything related to fixed rate protocol changes.  Warming up my no vote on Deco btw.   We don\u2019t need to do one single thing here except for governance to commit to terms on these IV vaults and basically stick with them.  Which is why the details and time frame as (term) are so important. ",

MadShills:  This all seems rather speculative and maybe not the right venue or time for these discussions. In the past (2018 onward) Maker offered the DSR.   Unfortunately, this is not speculation at all. In fact,  if you listen to Chairman Gensler\u2019s speeches the past months about the need to regulate \u201cborrowing and lending platforms,\u201d the SEC\u2019s sweep of DeFi protocols and the agency\u2019s position on Coinbase\u2019s proposed yield product,  Earn,  it\u2019s clear that a fixed rate offering to all Maker users will flash red lights with US regulators. Now I understand the points about \u201cwell, if this is an issue, what about [Sagittarius Engine or whatever else people are coming up with]?\u201d but I\u2019ll just say that as far as fixed income products where Maker Governance is expected to operate the issuance of clear securities (Vamsi\u2019s posts about Deco expressly says this), we should avoid engagements that lead us to regulated waters.
