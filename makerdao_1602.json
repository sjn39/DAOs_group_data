                    "content": " [DIRECT-COMPOUNDV2-DAI] Direct Deposit Module Technical Assessment The goal of this post is to provide a technical assessment for the new Compound D3M module. A similar assessment was done in the past for the AAVE D3M module before its launch. Note that the Collateral Engineering Services team has already posted an analysis of Compound and the CDAI token as standalone collateral.  General Information For the relevant addresses on Compound please refer to the CES post. Note that as planned, the CDAI delegate contract was upgraded to the version in 0x3363bae2fc44da742df13cd3ee94b6bb868ea376.  Technical Information The D3M module has been re-architected to support multiple D3M integrations in a modularized manner. The new system will contain the following contracts:  D3MHub - shared management and administration logic. D3MPool - per integration adapter responsible for depositing or withdrawing DAI from the target protocol. D3MPlan - per integration target DAI supply calculation logic.  Consequently, along with the D3MHub development, a D3MPool and a D3MPlan were developed for each integration (AAVE V2 and Compound V2). For more information see the documentation on the v2 branch on github.  Contract Risk Summary This is a high risk contract. A notable risk stems from the upgradeability of the Compound contracts. This is mitigated by a fail-safe mechanism for unwinding the module without governance delay in case of an upgrade of the relevant Compound contracts. There is also a general risk due to the significant design and code changes in the D3M codebase. As a result, the current code has gone through several internal independent reviews, along with an external audit by ChainSecurity. Another inherent risk in such an external integration is an unexpected exploit that involves some combination of Compound, this D3M, other D3Ms, and/or integrations that are built on top of the D3Ms. These scenarios have been examined as part of the review and audit process.
