As we progressively decentralize Gitcoin, and as Gitcoin Holdings takes a back seat, I imagine that this content will become increasingly important for the GitcoinDAO/ecosystem. Would any of you be interested in developing a GitcoinDAO homepage?  If so please submit a proposal by September 15th 2021. Please include  Who are you What is your proposal to build this What is your timeline to build this What do you need (funding, etc)  Please submit your proposal as a comment on the gov forum thread.

We are very interested in building a homepage for GitcoinDAO, hosting and continuously deploying it in a completely decentralized way. Some well-know DAPPs like uniswap-interface or ipfs-docs are already hosted on Crust Network, like by using crust-pin-job in the repository\u2019s github workflow. Similarly but further, we can provide a more decentralized solution for GitcoinDAO portal in following ways:   (Development) Build the portal in a way that can be exported as static HTML website   (Hosting) Host the portal in Crust Network, as we did for uniswap-interface. This can be done by using Github Action and crustio/ipfs-crust-action   (Domain Name) Use ENS (Ethereum Name Service) to always point to latest website release. Or, if ENS solution is not feasible or preferred, using dnslink and ipfs gateway with a traditional DNS domain. Dnslink/IpfsGateway/Clouldflare is a preferred solution from our point of view, as we are more experienced with it.   In fact, besides GitcoinDAO portal, we\u2019d like to contribute to the whole decentralization work of Gitcoin, to decentralizedly store various kinds of data of Gitcoin. But GitcoinDAO portal would be a good starting point. Pls let me know if you are intrested in our proposed solution. Thanks. ",
