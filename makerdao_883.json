As i write the collateralization ratio sits at ~2.5x down about 5000 basis points from recent weeks. Surplus buffer sits at -4,168,440.38 DAI. Not trying to start a panic obviously, but it seems prudent to get this poll out to executive vote https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmekpiectttt57tkfa7ygevpk8sbudkum7upswrqh7rgtz. Mirroring recent actions taken by the fed it seems that we might act in turn and drop the rates in order to spur any lending that we can ATM. This also should have the run-off effect of slowing down the bleeding in caused by the DSR. Is there anyway we could hurry an executive vote out? Outside of the suggested action items would it be possible to get some sort of statement from the foundation regarding recent events? ",
