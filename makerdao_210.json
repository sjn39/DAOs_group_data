Is this right? Or is the stablecoin in circulation to people use it for other purposes other than interacting directly with CurioDAO? 24:52 - Jerry Goldfarb: If the Vault would need to be liquidated, is there a market for the trigger stablecoin? 26:01 - Jerry Goldfarb: You talked about the Chainlink being the price oracle for RWAs. Will there be other expansion into other Layer2, so that might not be the only place to obtain that information in the future, but just for now? I am talking in terms of us setting up an oracle for our side. 28:05 - Jerry Goldfarb: On a previous call, we discussed a poll you posted for community members to vote on what they think the next vehicle should be. How did that turn out? Has that gone anywhere? What decision did you take? 31:02 - Jerry Goldfarb: Vladimir, you mentioned earlier that you wanted to get into some of the future and potentials of this. We touched on the cars especially. Is there plans to expand currently into other markets? 35:53 - Jerry Goldfarb: The conversation around what L2s we should be using is becoming more and more important. Is there any reason why you have chosen Solana, Chainlink, and these other blockchains that you have? 40:28 - Jerry Goldfarb: Are you aware that we got our new Discord started? 40:51 - Jerry Goldfarb: Any last words? 42:27 - Jerry Goldfarb: Where can people reach out to you if they have further questions?  Closing Comment  Jerry Goldfarb  Outro 43:18  Happy weekend! Thanks to you all.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.
