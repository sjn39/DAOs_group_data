I have no reason to believe they will say anything other than stablecoins present a significant systemic risk. They\u2019re focused on things like Tether and Diem. So their definition of stablecoin will matter intensely to us. If it is only fiat-redeemable stablecoins, we will enjoy a significant regulatory advantage and should be prepared to capitalize on it. It\u2019s all out of our hands, though. Probably best to just lay low around SEC, OCC, Treasury, certain Fed officials. ",

I hope Dai is in a good position with its transparent asset-backed model. USDC and USDP seem to be decently good at reporting their backing. USDC does monthly transparency reporting, while USDP does the same, both with independent auditors/accounting firms. Dai backed by these stablecoins through the PSM is a partnership with strongly positioned stablecoins. I am also sure the major issuers will begin moving to even more liquid assets with this push from the US Gov. I am not an expert in the matter of regulation though, just personal sentiment. I am curious to see how this unfolds in the coming years. Despite my positive view on Dai\u2019s model and current status there is much to improve on, we must keep working towards a shared ideal vision for this decentralized, backed, unbiased stablecoin.

USDC is probably fine. DAI backed by crypto collateral with oracles is probably fine. But DAI backed by USDC might not be from a regulatory standpoint due to two points of failure. This also applies to our stablecoin LP tokens. If I was introduced to this space, the first reaction would be that stablecoins backed by stablecoins is\u2026 a little weird! It is very hard to say how regulators would react to that though. ",

                    "content": "Excellent article - thanks for posting! Here is my summary of the article: Regulators are focused on a number of key risks in stable coins and will likely issue regulations that address these areas. KEY CONCERNS   Do the Stable Coin Issuer (SCI) have enough liquid assets to back up the value of their currency, particularly in times of market stress?   Do the SCI have software systems that are sufficiently robust to handle large surges in transactions, so they do not set off a chain reaction of trouble if many customers try to cash out in a short time period?   Does the the SCI have adequate systems to protect customer privacy and data?   Do the SCI have adequate systems to prevent their currencies from being used for money laundering and tax evasion?   The regulators will also likely issue rules around creating new stable coins.  The article doesnt indicate what issues there will focus on.   The Treasury Department is expected to issue a report this fall with recommendations that likely cover the five issues listed above, RATIONALE Federal officials have become concerned that the rapidly growing cryptocurrency market, particularly stable coins, create increasing risks of a \u2018digital bank run\u2019 that could impact the broader financial system and economy.  They view the stable coins as a bridge between the crypto markets and the broader financial system and economy.  Federal officials are considering using the Dodd-Frank law to declare that stable coins are \u201csystematically important\u201d that would subject them to stricter regulation. INDUSTRY REACTIONS Cryptocurrency companies/exchanges have begun to actively lobby regulators through a series of meetings with financial and banking regulators, including Tether, Circle, Paxos, Coinbase, Gemini, BlockFi, the Blockchain Association and Mastercard.  The industry players are attempting to shape the new regulations while also acknowledging that some federal oversight is inevitable.  Some SCI are also modifying their business practices.  Circle, for example, has announced plans to shift more of its reserves into liquid assets, for example, while Andreesen, Horowitz hired a former Senate aide to President Biden, Tomicah Tilleman, as their Global Head of Policy.
