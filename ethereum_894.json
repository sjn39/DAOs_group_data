Does this imply that X and Y are chosen arbitrarily at acceptance time here, or are they selected from a predetermined schedule of upgrade slots? I argue for the latter, because operators get a huge benefit from knowing upgrade times, even if the EIPs included are not known until later. For example: needing to schedule extra devops folks as on-call during upgrade-time, months in advance, around planned vacations, etc. I love:  the two-step acceptance process gets more formalized (and \u201ctentatively accepted\u201d is heavily downgraded semantically from \u201cEIP likely included\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re done testing\u201d) the added expectation that clients must support EIPs one-by-one, rather than fork-by-fork. Not all clients may be designed this way. that the testing team would decouple testing EIPs from testing forks  I think you get all those benefits without changing the release schedule. ",

This reinforces the idea that more work is certainly required. An EIP cannot become accepted by inertia, it requires active work. It should be no surprise if the EIP misses the next closest release date (as opposed to \u201cTentatively Accepted\u201d which might carry that baggage). When an EIP is finally accepted, it becomes \u201cScheduled for Inclusion,\u201d or just Scheduled for short. This reinforces the idea that no EIP is ever \u201cpotentially scheduled\u201d. An EIP is never prematurely paired with a particular release date, it only gets a date at acceptance time. The decoupling of EIPs from forks (in clients and testing) is what makes this late scheduling option feasible. ",

This takes some political pressure off of the process, and is similar to bills in parliament being worked on in committee, then going to the floor for final vote. From my observation of ADC meetings this would ease the decision-making process. This also improves the analysis of new features by providing a stage to focus more on the technical merits before later considering other issues e.g. the effect on stakeholder group. A difficulty might be that dev teams get tied up in a lot of work on accepted/blessed EIPs, but then these EIPs are never actually deployed because it has only delayed political contention. One way of mitigating contention is forming a separate committee, consisting of more representation from community groups (e.g. DeFi, game devs, data providers, miners, exchanges). I would name this group \u201cproduct\u201d or perhaps \u201croadmap\u201d. The findings of this committee (basically a set of position points) would of course not have any binding effect on ACD decisions, but it could be a key artifact to consider in the acceptance of an EIP or the final scheduling of release.
