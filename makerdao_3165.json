Paragraph Summary MIP39: Core Unit Framework contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP. The Core Unit is the basic building block for organizing work for the DAO. It denotes particular long-term objectives that Maker Governance has decided for the protocol to be secure and successful. Component Summary MIP39c1: Core Units Gives an overview of the most important characteristics of Core Units. MIP39c2: Adding Core Units (Subproposal Process) The process for adding new Core Units to the DAO primitives State. MIP39c3: Modifying Core Units (Subproposal Process) The process for modifying Core Units in the DAO primitives State. MIP39c4: Removing Core Units (Subproposal Process) The process for removing Core Units from the DAO primitives State. Motivation As the Foundation dissolves, MakerDAO must take over the tasks and responsibilities no longer fulfilled. We believe MakerDAO\u2019s current structure is too ill-defined to be able to integrate these successfully. A new scheme is needed for MakerDAO to achieve this crucial integration on its way to full autonomy. Core Units are DAO Primitives designed to be easy-to-transition-to and capable of accommodating both the current structures and the Foundation\u2019s newly delegated operations within a coherent framework. Core Units define long-term work areas and cover a broad set of responsibilities or focus. They are the basic units of work that Maker Governance is able to oversee, manage and prioritize. Specification / Proposal Details MIP39c1: Core Units What is a Core Unit? A Core Unit is a structure that has a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Facilitators, that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve a long-term goal within MakerDAO. Core Units are proposed by community members and voted on by Maker Governance. Each Core Unit may have a budget (MIP40). The Facilitators (MIP41) of a Core Unit may have additional permissions over the Maker Protocol or Governance Processes depending on their Core Unit\u2019s nature. Core Unit Mandates Core Unit Mandates set the direction of the work that Facilitators must help carry out by using their budget and exercising their Governance Powers. Mandates should be high-level and avoid trying to micromanage the Core Unit processes; instead, they should be broad, open-ended and give room for manoeuvre so as not to stifle the Facilitators\u2019 ability to come up with innovative solutions and efficient processes. Mandates can be regarded as \u201cquestions\u201d for Facilitators to \u201canswer\u201d with their Facilitator Commitment (MIP41) when proposing to be onboarded to a given Core Unit. Mandates from different Core Units can overlap to create redundancy and parallelize and decentralize work within the DAO. Core Objectives and Domains Core Objectives and Domains are not directly defined in the DAO Primitives MIP Set but are flexible concepts that emerge through the interaction of DAO Primitives. Core Units are at the intersection of Domains (which denote skillsets and capabilities) and Objectives (which denote cross-domain long term workstreams.) A Core Unit can participate in multiple objectives and can fall under one or more domains.  MIP39c2: Adding/Modifying Core Units (Subproposal Process)  This subproposal process allows Governance to create or modify an existing Core Unit by setting its Mandate and/or its name.  Care should be taken so that names and Mandates don\u2019t end up drifting apart from each other.   Once a subproposal is approved, the Governance Facilitator or the MIP Editor modifies the DAO Primitives State (MIP38) to append a new entry with the Core Unit specified in the subproposal. The Operational Support Core Unit, or the MIP Editor or Governance Facilitator, will also assign a Core Unit ID (e.g.: GOV1) to uniquely identify the given Core Unit. The proposal parameters are:  Minimum feedback period: 1 month. Minimum frozen period: 1 week.     MIP39c3: Removing Core Units (Subproposal Process)  This subproposal process allows Governance to remove a Core Unit from the DAO Primitives State (MIP38). A Core Unit can only be removed if it has no active budget implementations (see MIP40) and no active facilitators (see MIP41). The proposal parameters are:  Minimum feedback period 1 month Minimum frozen period: 1 week       Edit: Incorporated feedback for clarity, added to my github (accepting PRs) and also PRed the Maker Github. Thanks to @blimpa, @Deimos, @LongForWisdom, and everyone else that helped with the revision. Edit2: removed the MIP4c2-SP11 from dependencies, moved to formal submission. ",

                    "content": "    juan:  The Core Unit is the basic building block for organizing work for the Domains, and denotes a particular long-term objective that Maker Governance has decided must be achieved by the Domains in order for the protocol to be secure and successful.   You mention domains here, I think somewhere later you confirm that these are not strictly defined, but I wonder if this might cause confusion to include it in a summary. Maybe just refer to the DAO, rather than domains?     juan:  MIP39c2: Adding Core Units (Subproposal Process) The process for adding new Core Units to the DAO primitives State. MIP39c3: Modifying Core Units (Subproposal Process) The process for modifying Core Units in the DAO primitives State.   I\u2019d be tempted to combine these (assuming that you can \u2018amend-via-replace\u2019) just to cut down on the number of templates + text in this MIP.     juan:  Motivation Core Units define mission-critical, long-term areas of work and can cover a broad set of responsibilities. They are the basic units of domain work that Maker Governance is able to oversee, manage and prioritize.   This should maybe try to be more in-depth. Why the Core Unit structure over the existing domain structure, why this over other structures, etc.     juan:  MIP39c1: Definitions of the Core Unit Framework MIP   Short word on formatting. I would avoid long lists of bullet points. It\u2019s better than wall-of-text, but breaking up the content more naturally would make it easier to engage with. Having read the section, I\u2019m also not sure these qualify as definitions.     juan:  Core Units are a primary DAO Primitive used to enable Maker Governance to signal and prioritize the main objectives the domains need to solve.   What does primary mean in this context?     juan:  Core Units are at the intersection of Domains, which denotes skillsets and capabilities, and Core Objectives which denote cross-domain long term work streams. A Core Unit can participate in multiple Core Objectives, and can fall under multiple Domains.  Note on Core Objectives and Domains: both Core Objectives and Domains are not directly defined in the DAO Primitives, but are flexible concepts that emerge through the interaction of DAO Primitives.    I\u2019m not sure this adds much, and might make things less clear. I think it\u2019s trying to communicate that Core Units can cover domains and objectives? And also sort of define domains and objectives. If those are the aims  they can probably be achieved with more clarity by rewording.     juan:   Core Units have a Core Unit Mandate, which sets the direction of the work that Facilitators should use their budget and their Governance Powers to achieve. The Core Unit Mandate can be seen as a \u201cquestion\u201d that the facilitator has to \u201canswer\u201d with their Facilitator Commitment when they propose to be onboarded to that Core Unit. The Core Unit Mandate should be high level and avoid trying to micromanage the processes of the Core Unit, but be broad and open-ended enough that Maker Governance leaves room for Facilitators to come up with innovative solutions and efficient processes.    Might be better as its own component? Or at least it\u2019s own subheading on \u2018Core Unit Mandates.\u2019 Budgets and Governance powers haven\u2019t really been defined at this point. I would also seriously consider including a reference to some example good versus bad mandates here.     juan:  Multiple Core Units can be identical or overlap, in order to create redundancy.   Redundancy is good, I\u2019m not sure duplicating core units with identical mandates is the best way to achieve it (especially at this stage of the DAO\u2019s  development). I\u2019ll come back to this in later feedback.     juan:  MIP39c2: Adding Core Units (Subproposal Process)   Please try to match the layout used for other process components in other MIPs. Also, these process components should specify which template must be used for the subproposal.     juan:  Once a subproposal is approved, the Dao Primitives State is modified to append a new entry with the new Core Unit name and the Core Unit Mandate specified in the subproposal.   Be specific, whose job is it to update the DAO Primitives State MIP? If it\u2019s not defined, it\u2019s less likely to be done.     juan:  This subproposal process allows Governance to modify an existing Core Unit by changing its Core Unit Mandate.   Should this have restrictions around existing budgets? For example, if governance votes in a mandate to do one thing, and the mandate is modified, should there be a requirement to update the budget? If so, this requirement should be explicitly noted.     juan:  This subproposal process allows Governance to permanently delete a Core Unit from the global state. A Core Unit can only be deleted if has no active budget implementations and it has no active facilitators.   How does this interact if Governance wishes to remove a Core Unit, but the Facilitator is not willing to step down? Also up to this point \u2018active budget implementations\u2019 has not been defined. ",

E.g.,   Blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) are based on a redundant (in fact, as redundant as possible!) set of nodes, each having the copy of the same data. This is because any of these nodes could go offline, be corrupted, be malicious, be censored, etc\u2026 So you need redundancy to make sure things work even when bad stuff happens.   Similarly, in a DAO, you can\u2019t necessarily prevent a Core Unit from, e.g.,  disappearing at any time. After all, there are no \u201creal word contracts\u201d being signed, the contributors could be anonymous, etc\u2026 Some degree of redundancy is needed to make sure that operations are maintained up even if something goes wrong somewhere.

That being said, adding to @iammeeoh thoughts, I can think of four types of instances:  Like sports teams - there\u2019s one set of primary starters and one may be \u201cbench\u201d to provide backup or additional people ramping up into the primary place. Having more than one team work on something (like a collateral evaluation or audits) provides multiple sets of data that could be helpful to compare. Unstoppable / distributed information - Instead of two teams running two different forums - maybe there\u2019s always a copy backing up or it\u2019s hosted in multiple places so if and when a server comes down or one of the owner stops/leaves, it continues for the greater group. Same function, different value propositions - if there\u2019s one core unit that offers x value proposition (specific relationship, price, nuanced expertise or approach), you can have another different core unit that offers y value prop. Governance may pay twice for one function, but it is actually gaining a wider reach.  Ideally, we still have collaboration (and coordination at minimum) between teams. That\u2019s what Operational Support is trying to help balance  ",

This Framework is trying to address exactly that:  It provides the DAO a \u201cCore Unit\u201d directory (MIP38), with their mandates, budgets, and facilitators to provide an overview. It allows the DAO to turn on/off any Core Unit / Budget / Facilitators in a simple way (MIP39, MIP40, MIP41). Reporting should give the DAO a good overview of how each unit is performing.  Then there are possibilities of overlapping Core Units for redundancy, healthy competition, etc. We\u2019ll see how that pans out in the future. ",
