                    "content": "In the circumstance where MakerDao is under Dai price pressure liquidation of Vaults into Dai is problematic as it increases the demand for Dai further. What if instead of liquidations taking place in Dai when Dai price is out of range (whatever that is determined to be) the vaults were liquidated instead into a basket of other assets priced by the oracles and Dai was issued by the MakerDao system to sell to the market in order to purchase those assets. This way the Dai price pressure is downward and Dai supply raises to keep balance with Dai demand, yet the system stays fully backed by collateral in all cases (including all of the new Dai issued). As a result of the Dai price being so high and out of range this can occur without limit.  MakerDao is selling $1.00 for $1.05 or whatever the Dai price is and this can keep happening until Dai demand gets back into balance. When demand for Dai is in balance again then Vaults can again switch to liquidation for Dai to repay Dai debt.  So long as the assets in the system are diversified enough I don\u2019t see a reason that this wouldn\u2019t be sustainable forever. Also this is significantly better because in cases where the market is crashing which is usually the case when liquidations occur MakerDao is buying distressed assets and providing liquidity instead of the opposite which helps stabilize rather than exacerbate the crash in asset prices.  It is important to note that these assets are diversified so that MakerDao is not buying any one asset too much as that asset falls to $0.00 as that would be a huge issue. This whole system is built on balance, so anything that can be done to balance supply of Dai with demand for Dai should be a good thing as far as I understand.  I believe this change to the liquidation process accomplishes that elegantly and leads to better balance overall. ",

I am not entirely sure how a PSM would play into this since PSMs are new, but if I had to guess I would say that the PSMs do sort of the same thing.  They increase the Dai supply while simultaneously increasing the collateral to back that Dai.  The idea I first mentioned here for the PSM or a simpler version is what I had in mind for the PSM.  I realize now that this doesn\u2019t 100% work because at the upper range of Dai price the demand is being generated at the same speed we are trying ot reduce it which gets MakerDao nowhere. By first increasing the Dai supply and selling Dai while it is expensive and then afterwords doing the opposite MakerDao can keep the balance much better. ",
