                    "content": "Hey all, So we managed to lower DAI price by implementing 101% LR on stablecoins and increasing debt ceilings to meet DAI demand. We knew that by implementing this, MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin exposure is going to shoot up and currently represents 45% of debt exposure. I think it doesn\u2019t hurt if we already start discussing how we can reduce this exposure in the near to long term. Assuming 4% SF on stablecoin vaults, we should have 3 months time before stability fees on some stablecoin vaults stop effectively accruing fees for the system. We can however lower SF and prolong the time this happens, but essentially it doesn\u2019t change anything for the system as a whole because Maker can collect maximum 1% from 101% LR vaults. Also note that \u201closses\u201d from potentially undercollateralized vaults due to SF accrual should be offset by surplus that fees on same vaults generated. The main question is how we can generate enough DAI supply from other assets so these stablecoin vaults unwind by themselves or through manual liquidations when DAI price is low enough. Community voted in favour of speeding the process of RWA onboarding, but it is less probable that the system generates few hundred million DAI from those assets in the near term. There are also initiatives to speed up onboarding of crypto collateral to generate more supply and put more focus on assets that are able to produce a lot of DAI. We know that currently the assets with most DAI minting potential are farm related ones. Somehow the most sustainable ones seem to be LPs from Uniswap or Balancer, yVaults and secondary lending tokenized deposits such as c-tokens. In addition to having high potential to generate DAI supply, they also carry high yield which means Maker could set SF proportionally to those yields and receive good compensation for increased risks. Adding these assets would imply that Maker is indirectly swapping one stablecoin exposure for another (instead of higher USDC we may have higher cUSDC exposure), but we can be sure that Maker will definitely be able to collect much more than 1% as in current case. I am curious about community desires to onboard assets such as:  Yearn  yyCRV yDAI yUSDC   Compound  cUSDC cDAI   UNI LPs  ETH/DAI ETH/USDC ETH/USDT ETH/WBTC   BAL LPs  ETH/BAL ETH/DAI ETH/USDC   Aave (when liquidity mining starts)  aUSDC aDAI    SF management with these kinds of assets will need to be a bit more flexible and frequent, assuming the goal is to maximize them based on farm yields generated, which we know can be very volatile. Also keep in mind that adding something like yyCRV in the past was risky due to low DAI liquidity in Curve pool and related issues to withdrawing DAI and unwinding those vaults (case with yETH). But since we were able to fix the peg and improve liquidity, this is less of an issue now. Note that by swapping USDC exposure to cUSDC or yUSDC we aren\u2019t exactly unwinding stablecoin exposure, so the title for this discussion might be inappropriate. But I see this only as the first step before onboarding RWA and other assets, where we switch stablecoin exposure to farm related stablecoin exposure and achieve better risk compensation. It enables MakerDAO to indirectly participate in yield farming. Also keep in mind the other regular measures to stimulate more DAI supply from other sources apart from RWA onboarding is regularly adding vanilla tokens such as BAL, YFI, LEND, PAXG (planned in October cycle) and potentially introducing lower LR ETH Vault types.

They are also versatile in that they can be held directly by the protocol without too much fear of volatility or custodial risk (depending on the token pair), as well as being open to the public. We would also be improving defi liquidity in general, which would help us indirectly. I don\u2019t have issue with any of the tokens talked about in the post, and think most of them represent excellent opportunities to improve dai stability while also being less complex to implement than RWA.

It comes with a price. 1 USDC might be worth 1 USD in a bank, but does MakerDAO want to open a bank account? Selling USDC for something else than 1 USD in a bank might be worth a different price when MakerDAO is a large seller.     Primoz:  MakerDAO\u2019s stablecoin exposure is going to shoot up and currently represents 45% of debt exposure   So, that\u2019s how decentralization dies \u2026 with thunderous applause (59% including wBTC). I wonder when people will realize that DAI is not the same DAI as 9 months ago: it\u2019s just a wrapper for a weird combination of centralized stablecoins and (soon) yield farming tokens with an unpredictable value mostly in the range of $1.01 to $1.06.     Primoz:  I am curious about community desires to onboard assets such as:   I\u2019m not against those assets but unwinding them when shit happens will incure big losses for the MakerDAO system. The mentioned protocols are natural candidates for issuing stablecoins like DAI - they have almost everything on their side (capitalization, income, decentralized governance, more developers\u2026) to outcompete MakerDAO so we have to be careful not to give them too much power. EDIT: I forgot to offer a solution: do anything that is needed to make borrowing from ETH attractive. Limit borrowing from stablecoins and centralized assets and do not subsidize that risk. Raise more capital\u2026 ",

There are very few assets though that have low volatility and no custodial risk. LP tokens are probably the closest thing we have rn, and any other non-custodial assets like this will have to have their value derived from decentralized currencies. We are not trying to remove custodial risk altogether, but it is worrisome when a single counterparty like circle makes up a large percentage of the total dai debt. The best way to deal with the custodial asset types we do want to hold is to diversify across multiple counterparties and also multiple legal jurisdictions. ",

There\u2019s nothing wrong with stablecoins in general (although it should be noted that too much exposure to any one stablecoin, centralized or no, may be unhealthy). While we wait for RWA to become a thing, and since new crypto collateral seems to be a little slow to onboard at the moment, we should look at what we can start doing right now to start influencing our exposure to these assets. I\u2019ve been saying that we need to try to make other assets more attractive to borrow against. Lower LR, lower RP, higher DC. I can\u2019t guarantee that this would work; I can say that if I had a pile of wealth, and I was considering putting some of it in a vault and borrowing against it (probably to do some yield farming), I wouldn\u2019t necessarily care exactly which asset I was borrowing against, so long as it gave me the best of those three things. What I\u2019m saying is that I think yield farmers don\u2019t necessarily care what they\u2019re putting into their vault; I think they care about how much Dai they can get out of it, and how much it costs them; exactly how much leverage they can get. Should we form a strategy around yield farming? I don\u2019t know. It seems to be a booming sector right now, so I think it\u2019s not a bad idea to move in that direction. ",

I highly doubt the U.S. wants to abolish innovative Tech that pegs to the USD and has potential to score world exposure. Hence, you have some big time players pushing USDC to overtake USDT. The Washington DC guys would prefer USDC, versus USDT, or other CBDCs.
