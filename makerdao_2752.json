                    "content": "Hi! This is Ryan from TrustToken. We are excited to be making a submission to include TUSD in MCD. We\u2019ve been speaking with people on the Maker team about this for a while now and we are glad to finally have a chance for our projects to work together. In addition to TUSD, we\u2019ve launched additional fiat-backed stablecoins including TGBP, TCAD, TAUD, THKD, with more coming. Once we begin getting circulation on those tokens, we\u2019d love to see them included in MCD, as well. It would make for an easy way to on-board multiple fiats into the MCD ecosystem with TrustToken handling the KYC/AML, bank relationships, etc. If you have any questions or feel that our answers lack necessary detail, please feel free to comment below and I will do my best to address all of them in a timely manner.

In general, I think I\u2019d like to see more detail on some of these answers. Taking a more proactive approach would also have been appreciated. Presumably you are broadly aware of how the Dai Credit System works, and you are aware of how your token works. What risks do you see to MKR Holders as a result of us including TUSD (or others) in the system? While we\u2019ll be doing due diligence, it would be great to get your opinion on the risks as well as more detail on the benefits. Here are some immediate questions that jump out at me. I\u2019m unsure how many of these you can answer freely, if there are some you are unsure about, feel free to come back to those when you have the appropriate information.  Can TUSD be blacklisted and burned when it is within a CDP in the Dai Credit System? If it can, and such a blacklist+burn becomes necessary, how will your company handle this situation? As @Adam_Skrodzki mentioned, you are currently using OwnerUpgradableProxy, do you plan to add or modify the functionality of your implementation within the next ten years? You have provided a link to the latest of four audits from Level K, can you provide links to the previous three audits? You say that \u2018Company funds are held in fiat USD or TrueUSD\u2019 in terms of treasury management. Can you elaborate? How does your company make money? Do you collect interest on the deposited USD? Does this remain as USD in the escrow accounts or is it held in another form? Is your company currently profitable? Your website says \u2018Transparent: Real-time proof of funds in an escrowed bank account.\u2019 Is this viewable online, if so, where? Your website also says: \u2018Ethical: We\u2019ve published a code of ethics demonstrating our commitment to always being fully backed, redeemable, stable, and compliant\u2019 Where can we find this code of ethics? How does your implementation on Binance chain effect the security and value of this token? I am not an expert, but in general dPos is viewed as less secure than PoW. How much TUSD is currently active on the Binance Chain versus the Eth Chain? If the TUSD on the Binance chain is compromised, how will that effect the stability of TUSD on the Eth chain? If your company were to go bankrupt, or to cease operating for any reason, how can TUSD be redeemed? You mention in your legal docs that holders of TUSD have a claim on the USD in the escrowed bank accounts. How is this recovered and what does this process look like? Are lawyers involved? In your best estimate, how much USD would be recovered for each outstanding TUSD token in this situation?  Looking forward to seeing the responses. Thanks! ",

Yes, they can replace the implementation any time, and have in the past to upgrade to audited implementations to pull new optimizations. Every upgrade we have done and will do is to fully-audited implementations that do not break functionality. Several other projects in DeFi are controlled by a multisig. There is no single point of failure. (This response comes from one of our lead engineers. I will ask him to create an account so that, moving forward he can address future concerns of this nature directly) ",

                    "content": "Thanks for taking so much time to write out these questions, LongForWisdom. I also caught your remarks on today\u2019s governance call. Please let me know how we can continue to address the community skepticism. FWIW, I haven\u2019t seen any of the remarks on this thread as skepticism. These comments are about the kind of thoughtful questioning I would expect from the Maker community.     LongForWisdom:   Can TUSD be blacklisted and burned when it is within a CDP in the Dai Credit System? If it can, and such a blacklist+burn becomes necessary, how will your company handle this situation?     Please review our Terms of Use for our AML-CTF standards and our prohibited uses.      LongForWisdom:  As @Adam_Skrodzki mentioned, you are currently using OwnerUpgradableProxy, do you plan to add or modify the functionality of your implementation within the next ten years?    Not currently, but we would consider it if, for example, there was a critical bug found in the implementation contract. We have upgraded in the past in order to optimize our gas consumption. Each of our upgrades was to an audited implementation.      LongForWisdom:   You have provided a link to the latest of four audits from Level K, can you provide links to the previous three audits?     Certik Audit Slow Mist Audit I have a note to not share the 4th (scrolled through and there is nothing critical in it, but let me circle back with you on that next week). I am not sure why.      LongForWisdom:   You say that \u2018Company funds are held in fiat USD or TrueUSD\u2019 in terms of treasury management. Can you elaborate? How does your company make money? Do you collect interest on the deposited USD? Does this remain as USD in the escrow accounts or is it held in another form? Is your company currently profitable?     Meaning that corporate funds are held in USD bank account (as would be the case for any company) along with some balance held in TUSD that we use for e.g., contractor payments, a 1-off OTC deal, etc. Our company makes money by retaining the interest generated from holding the USD that collateralizes TUSD. The interest generated is transferred directly to a company account and does not touch the escrow account. re profitability: we do not have capital concerns      LongForWisdom:   Your website says \u2018Transparent: Real-time proof of funds in an escrowed bank account.\u2019 Is this viewable online, if so, where?     Yes. Right now, we perform two types of confirmations on the USD supporting TUSD. We work with Armanino, which provides a live confirmation of the funds behind TUSD. You can view that here. We\u2019ve been working with them since the summer of 2019. Our original accounting relationship has been with Cohen & Co., and you can view the entire history of our TUSD attestations here.      LongForWisdom:   Your website also says: \u2018Ethical: We\u2019ve published a code of ethics demonstrating our commitment to always being fully backed, redeemable, stable, and compliant\u2019 Where can we find this code of ethics?     You can find that here.      LongForWisdom:   How does your implementation on Binance chain effect the security and value of this token? I am not an expert, but in general dPos is viewed as less secure than PoW. How much TUSD is currently active on the Binance Chain versus the Eth Chain? If the TUSD on the Binance chain is compromised, how will that effect the stability of TUSD on the Eth chain?     Approximately $303k TUSD is currently circulating on Binance Chain. Binance Chain uses Tendermint for consensus. Both consensus protocols are subject to the Byzantine Generals Problem. Some could argue that, in some ways, Tendermint is superior to PoW; for example, Tendermint has no block reorganizations. We plan to support atomic peg between the two blockchains after securing the supply on Binance Chain using rolling time locks. The amount of TUSD that could be compromised on Ethereum would be limited by the amount in the peg contract. The WIP peg contract code being developed by Binance is here.      LongForWisdom:   If your company were to go bankrupt, or to cease operating for any reason, how can TUSD be redeemed? You mention in your legal docs that holders of TUSD have a claim on the USD in the escrowed bank accounts. How is this recovered and what does this process look like? Are lawyers involved? In your best estimate, how much USD would be recovered for each outstanding TUSD token in this situation?     The escrowed USD is held by each escrow agent solely for the benefit of each TUSD Holder. Neither the Company nor any of the escrow agents are entitled to any of the escrowed USD. The escrowed USD is not subject to any debts, liens or encumbrances of any kind of the Company or the escrow agents. Therefore, if the Company dissolves the escrowed USD would not be available to any Company creditors.  If the Company dissolves for any reason, each escrow agent is legally obligated to process all redemptions for TUSD holders that have either already created an account with the Company and, therefore, passed our KYC procedures, or for new Holders of TUSD that pass an escrow agent\u2019s KYC procedures. On the corporate side, a wind-down agent would be appointed to assist the escrow agents\u2019 process redemptions and protect the property rights of the Holders. If 100% of the TUSD tokens are held by persons who have either (1) already passed the Company\u2019s KYC procedures, or (2) who pass an escrow agent\u2019s KYC procedures after the company dissolves, then 100% of the TUSD tokens would be available for redemption.

This makes Dai more stable.   The borrowers of Dai against other stablecoins are most likely going to be market makers. When a market maker mints Dai and sells it above $1, their assumption is that they will be able to repurchase it at $1 to pay off their CDP before the stability fees eliminate their profit (i.e. arbitrage). This much is obvious, but only represents half of the calculus. The other consideration a market maker must take into account is the price performance of the underlying asset which they used to mint the Dai in the first place. If using ETH, for example, they now must either hedge out ETH\u2019s price volatility (which will be costly itself) or hope that it does not decrease in price to the point where it wipes out their arbitrage profits. By being able to lock a non-directional asset into the CDP, their calculus is simplified to price above $1 - stability fees.   Hope that helps. ",

These comments are about the kind of thoughtful questioning I would expect from the Maker community.   Fair enough, skepticism may have been too strong a word. Caution may have been a more appropriate choice.     RyanRodenbaugh:  Please review our Terms of Use  for our AML-CTF standards and our prohibited uses.   I have skimmed these prohibited uses. My question is more related to your response. It would be great to get a clear answer of what your response would be. Would you be forced to blacklist and burn tokens that were locked in a CDP? (Note: I realise that any answer to this is akin to shooting yourself in the foot in front of either us or the U.S government. Sorry for that, but it\u2019s important information. My assumption is that yes, you would be forced to do this.) In my view it\u2019s critically important that we understand what happens here, if you are forced to blacklist and burn then that makes the DCS a pathway for non-compliant individuals to convert their \u2018burnable\u2019 money into \u2018non-burnable\u2019 Dai without a counter party and in such a way that it negatively affects MKR Holders when you are forced to blacklist and burn \u2018their\u2019 tokens.     RyanRodenbaugh:  I have a note to not share the 4th (scrolled through and there is nothing critical in it, but let me circle back with you on that next week). I am not sure why.

Our original accounting relationship has been with Cohen & Co., and you can view the entire history of our TUSD attestations here.   This is fairly impressive! I recognise that you are not armanino, but if possible could you pass along the suggestion that historical data is also recorded and displayed? It would be great to verify that TUSD (or any other stablecoins they support) have always been backed 1-1. I\u2019ll also note that without doing a lot of cross-checking it\u2019s difficult to ensure that the attestations match the amount of TUSD in circulation on the blockchain. I\u2019m they always match, but the information could be presented more effectively.     RyanRodenbaugh:  You can find that here. (Ethics blogpost)   All looks very sensible, thanks for the point in the right direction.     RyanRodenbaugh:   Approximately $303k TUSD is currently circulating on Binance Chain.

RyanRodenbaugh:  The escrowed USD is held by each escrow agent solely for the benefit of each TUSD Holder. Neither the Company nor any of the escrow agents are entitled to any of the escrowed USD\u2026   Fantastic answer, thanks for clarifying this process in more detail and glad to hear that in theory 100% of the funds can be recovered. Just one follow up question: You mentioned a wind-down agent would be appointed, how is this funded? ",

Keeping track of this forum feels like juggling plates lately.  I actually don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to start organising things on this thread yet. It\u2019s a discussion of the application submitted by Ryan and thus far the majority of responses have been on-topic as I\u2019d judge it. In terms of a todo list, what do you feel needs doing here? Are you referring to due diligence generally, looking into contract code, checking attestations and such? I\u2019m a little reluctant to start pushing people into action on the subject yet as there is a whole stack of assets that are further up the priority list (at least as MKR Token Holders voted it.) There is also the question as to which responsibilities fall under the community generally, and which responsibilities are delegated to the risk teams. I believe Cyrus will be making this more clear in the future.      RyanRodenbaugh:  Please let me know how we can continue to address the community skepticism.   I kind of blanked over this on my last read-through, and I had some thoughts when I read over it again just now. My suggestions would be the following:  Be proactively transparent. Tell us the ways in which including TUSD (or your other tokens) could screw over the Dai Credit System and/or MKR Token Holders. Point us to anything we should look out for or worry about. Share any doubts you have about your system. Tell us what the difficult questions are and answer them as best you can. Continue to monitor the thread and answer any questions that arise as openly as possible. If you are unable to answer openly state why you can\u2019t and try to find a way to resolve the issue. Maintain the level of politeness and respect you have so far (and try not to take to heart our somewhat pointed responses.)  ",

I designed the current system to minimize our risks, and I work to mitigate our risks over time. Our \u201cmint key\u201d is secured within a hardware security module (HSM) in the cloud, so it is not physically located on our premises. We interact with the device through PKCS11, and it can only be accessed from a subset of our servers (the \u201csigning service\u201d), none of which face the public internet. No employees have ever had access to this key, nor would they be able to extract it. While the HSM is in control of engineering, it takes two engineers to update the signing service. Additionally, as explained below, there are limits and restrictions on this key. On-chain, TrueUSD minting is controlled by a multisig \u201ctoken controller\u201d. We have an Instant Mint Pool from which this key can mint. There are limits on this pool on a per-mint basis, but also in aggregate. Refilling this pool requires a signature from one of several select employees outside engineering, called \u201cmint security officers\u201d. These individuals have read access to our bank accounts and verify the integrity of the supply before refilling. They cannot initiate mints; they can only ratify or pause them. Mint security officers take on-call in shifts and respond to escalations from our monitoring system. Instant Mint Pool refills come from a \u201cRatifier Pool\u201d which itself must be refilled from a larger \u201cMultiratifier Pool\u201d by signatures from 3 mint security officers. It is possible to mint from the ratifier pool directly with a signature from the mint key and a ratifier. Similarly, it is possible to mint from the multiratifier pool using the mint key and 3 mint security officer signatures. These \u201cmint requests\u201d allow larger, but less-instant, mints. The Multiratifier Pool is refilled and configured by the owner multisig. Keyholders for this multisig are significant stakeholders, and we have guidelines that limit risky tweaking. Reconfigurations are not arbitrary; limit increases typically follow improvements to our security. Contract implementation upgrades require strong justification and a third-party audit. Our most recent set of upgrades was audited by LevelK.  TokenController code MultisigOwner code  Of course, there is room to improve. I\u2019m interested in your ideas. I hope this has helped assuage fears about our mint security. Working with the prior banking system is challenging, but it means you can send money directly to your bank account, or move your money onto the blockchain. ",

We work with real-world assets that can be seized by thieving socialists. We must take action to protect our token holders from the forces of evil, but there are limitations to we can do within the old banking system if the government turned hostile to property. We have a strong legal team working to ensure we are in compliance, but laws and regulations can change suddenly and drastically. For example, earlier this year it looked like they were going to say non-custodial decentralized exchanges were illegal money laundering schemes, but now it looks like they are exempt from standard BSA/AML requirements. We have obtained the licenses we need to operate, but some jealous government agency might think we need their license as well, whether we do or not. Or, a new agency may spring up and demand we shut down operations until we have their license. We have invested in building a scalable compliance infrastructure, but if our compliance program or legal guidance were insufficient, we could be fined a large sum, which could threaten us existentially. For any reason, third parties could block our payments, which would prevent market makers from being able to protect our peg.  ",

The prior post in this thread about mint security is more up-to-date than what is described in the blogpost, and includes commentary about our HSM. We have moved authentication in-house, which reduces third-party risk. We also have switched to a microservice architecture, which reduces the scope of potential breeches. Our intrusion detection system protects against categories of attacks and also notifies us about security updates to our dependencies, so we can easily keep them up to date. ",
