                    "content": " Operational Data Core Unit [Incubation] - Survey Results Summary During August and September, our team conducted a survey to assess the need for a core unit dedicated exclusively to providing and maintaining Maker-related data services, aiming mainly to improve upon the existing APIs that provide operational/transactional data to dapps, dashboards, bots, etc. This effort aimed to gather more information about the community\u2019s current needs, mainly the core units maintaining and building the next generation of tools for the DAO. Today we are sharing the results with the whole ecosystem because we believe our findings can be beneficial not only to ourselves but also to anyone who cares about the good health of the applications and infrastructure that support and help this community grow. We\u2019re firm believers in lean methodologies, so we conducted this research to ensure the service we provide to the DAO is the best one possible. The value-added will benefit all the existing working groups and core units and the hundreds that will come in the future. The data resulting from this survey is being analyzed in detail and poured into a Value Proposition Canvas and Empathy Map that will be part of our core unit proposal. These will help us shape our work into an excellent service for the community. The survey consisted of 20 questions to understand the current data needs and how the MakerDAO stakeholders imagine these needs will change in the future. The survey also explores current data sources and how the existing solutions are handling these demands. Seven existing and future Core Units and one independent team that provides services to the DAO replied to the survey. We may update this summary in the future as more teams collaborate by providing their input on the survey.  Key Findings  1. The need From our analysis of this data, we conclude that the core units and teams creating and maintaining the main applications and infrastructure that give life to the DAO find the existing data solutions insufficient for their current and future needs. To scale rapidly and reliably, we need open-source, decentralized solutions, always up-to-date with the latest protocol\u2019s changes, highly reliable, easy to maintain, and easy to integrate with existing and new applications. Most importantly, these services need to ensure continuity, making this job a long-term commitment. Below you can find some of the most relevant answers that take us to this conclusion. You can also skip to the end and access the raw data directly.  2. Level of satisfaction with the current solution  Average: 5 out of 10 Min: 3 out of 10 Max: 8 out of 10   3. Most important data attributes  Data correctness/exactness Up-to-date with latest protocol changes Open-source Full-range historical data Reliability/uptime   mkr-data-attributes1168\u00d7980 63.7 KB   4. Most essential attributes of a data provider  Long-term availability. Knowledge that the data provider will be there for the period I plan to use it. That they provide a way out in case we can\u2019t use their service anymore. Data export and interoperability. Straightforward onboarding. Support. Easiness to fork/deploy. Low maintenance cost.   5. Types of data consumed   Governance: 6 out of 8 respondents Vaults: 5 out of 8 respondents Token info (MKR, DAI): 5 out of 8 respondents Liquidations: 3 out of 8 respondents Oracles: 4 out of 8 respondents Stats/analytics: 3 out of 8 respondents GAS Consumption: 3 out of 8 respondents DSR: 3 out of 8 respondents Protocol parameters: 3 out of 8 respondents   6. What is this data being used for   Dapp and dashboards: 6 out of 8 respondents Docs and reports: 3 out of 8 respondents Notifications: 3 out of 8 respondents Bot: 2 out of 8 respondents Analysis: 2 out of 8 respondents Monitoring: 2 out of 8 respondents Marketing campaigns: 1 out of 8 respondents   7. Current data services used  Maker\u2019s API (Vulcanize, Spock): 5 out of 8 respondents web3 / contract events: 2 out of 8 respondents Subgraphs: 1 out of 8 respondents Dune: 1 out of 8 respondents Flaps Auction API: 1 out of 8 respondents OasisDex API: 1 out of 8 respondents   8. Drawbacks from current data sources  No long-term commitment Unreliability Centralization Missing data or errors in processing/storage Proprietary Self-hosted Security Low community awareness   9. Main requests for a new data source  Open-source Decentralized Updated with recent changes to the protocol Free access Good documentation Low cost Good / best coverage of the Maker Protocol  The source data from the survey can be found and downloaded here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rnilq4bAcE3dkNt4Ati3oyi6JJGn1iyP8mQ9V2gqkuM/edit#gid=2052605494 Also, if you would like to contribute your experience and complete the survey, you can do it here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WVF28VY You can find us at the SES Discord or dm us on Telegram: @leolower ",

We will be using The Graph decentralized network for the new APIs, this means there will be many indexers/servers running our software and answering queries made by the other CU\u2019s applications. Also, all of our code will be open source so anyone needing to understand how our subgraphs work or who wants to fork and create their own versions of them could easily do it. Our core unit will only focus on data services, specifically operational/transaction data. That is APIs that expose what is happening on Maker\u2019s smart contracts. ",
