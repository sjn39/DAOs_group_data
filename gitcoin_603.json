                    "content": "Hey all, The Gitcoin multisig was created in August 2020, before the GitcoinDAO launch. It has the following keyholders:  myself David Hoffman Sassal Hudson Jameson Eric Coner Kyle Weiss  As we got around to paying out GR11, we realized that things have evolved a lot since we created this multisig.  Particularly,  We now have formal governance of GitcoinDAO via the Gitcoin Stewards. Things have shifted in the ecosystem, and many of the keyholders are now busy with other projects.  As a result, we started to have a conversation about what it would look like to have a \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d here.  Specifically, David Hoffman, Sassal, and Eric Conner have all told me that they are interested in rolling off the multisig.  There are two directions we could go.  Rotate the multisig keyholders to be top GitcoinDAO stewards, which are currently Trent, Austin, Linda, Lefteris - on a case by case basis if they want it. Transfer all of the assets in the multisig to the Timelock.  I would like to hear which way the community would like us to go. One consideration that you should know about  if you consider doing (2) is that right now the only way to rebalance tokens into DAI (which is what the Grants Rounds are paid out with) is to do a trade on uniswap/1inch or any other DEX.  We\u2019ve found that if there is a long lag between when those txns are proposed and executed on chain, that the transaction will fail - presumably due to slippage.  If the community decides to go with (2) we will need a workaround that allows governance to rebalance the treasury within the structure of the 2 day Timelock. What do ppl want to see?       Rotate the Multisig Keyholders to top Stewards     Move all tokens into the GitcoinDAO Timelock     Other (pls comment below)       0 voters     ",

Whether it\u2019s the DAO or the multi-sig controlling the funds, it should absolutely use Cowswap for trades to avoid MEV or transaction failing due to falling outside of the slippage tolerance.     disruptionjoe1:  Another option would be to leave it in the multisig but use a Zodiac module to initiate governance control. @auryn would probably be best to explain.   Absolutely! There is no need to move funds from the safe, the GitcoinDAO\u2019s timelock can be enabled as a module on the Gnosis Safe, giving it full control over the funds. The nice thing with this is that both the DAO and the multisig members can control the safe in parallel. If we want to get real crazy, we could even use a scope guard to limit the scope of what the multisig members are allowed to do. So maybe they are only allowed to do swaps on cowswap, but anything else requires DAO proposal. ",
