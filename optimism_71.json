                    "content": "This consideration is for those who want to discuss increasing the intrinsic value of the optimism token without taking the route of  performing complex technical/structural maneuvers on the chain such as the ones some other well received proposals have proposed. (Think about stock buy backs) Optimism Buyback and or burn   DAO can use profits or a certain share of profits from  buy back Optimism tokens.   Make it a weekly/monthly operation and direct the tokens to a DAO controlled wallet   Revenues directed to a DAO controlled wallet, effectively removing tokens from supply.   This is a rather streamlined way to bring value or rather increase the value of the Optimism token by reducing the circulating supply in the market. Rationale There is much debate about whether or not there should be emphasis on \u201cincreasing the price of optimism\u201d and it is apparent from discussions that some in the community frown upon the idea doing things to make the price \u201chike\u201d. Some argue that a governance token should be just a governance token and governance should be the only inherent value the token has. So if you are one of those members, well the rationale below is not for you. Every business decision pertaining to Optimism\u2019s governance should be geared towards increasing the Optimism token\u2019s price and NO we should not make short sighted decisions to \u201cpump\u201d the price in the short term. Adhering to a core belief of optimism, we should continue with the belief that impact=price. However, in this industry, whether we like it or not, price of a project\u2019s token is how everyone takes a temperature check on the project\u2019s health. Market cap in fact is a great indicator of consumer/user confidence and taking measures to improve that will attract more users. We need more users and a greater community to create a greater impact. However, how do we attract more users and more importantly how do we attract quality governors? Unfortunately perception is reality and we have had a bit of rough launch. How do we signal that we will bring value? Nobody wants to spend time \u201cgoverning\u201d if it doesn\u2019t generate personal gain; why would they?  There are plenty of other uses for one\u2019s money. As such there is a great use case for doing something like a buyback and or burn program in order to gain traction and communicate value propositions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking measures to increase the value of the token in a way that will garner attention. An announcement of buy back and burn is exactly what we need to make noise. Once we make the noise we don\u2019t have to worry about coming down hard because the fundamentals are there to carry us all the way. As long as we are certain that the product is a 100% there is nothing wrong with doing something to demand the price it deserves. This is an L2 pioneer. Keep in mind all the market leaders (ETH, BNB, MATIC etc.) have done some version of a buyback and burn program with great success. ",

The Optimism Foundation runs a single centralized sequencer that is solely responsible for generating Layer 2 (L2) blocks and adding transactions to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 (L1). The sorter fee consists of two parts, the L2 execution fee and the L1 data fee. L2 execution fees are similar to Ethereum gas fees. The amount of fees to be paid depends on the complexity of the transaction, i.e. its computational and storage requirements. That\u2019s about 1% of what users pay. The L1 data fee is the cost of publishing a batch of transactions to Ethereum. The sorter uses a cost-plus approach, charging users a price higher than the L1 cost. It currently charges 1.24 times the sum of the gas required to submit a transaction and 2,100 gas. This generates surpluses that will be used to fund the growth of the ecosystem. It\u2019s worth noting that 99% of the fees charged by Optimism are L1 data fees. So far, these fees paid by users have brought in $24.5 million in revenue for Optimism. link to this is here!

But Optimism is a collective and its goals (amongst other things) are to provide an EVM equivalent layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution and to support public goods funding. Diverting protocol revenue towards token buybacks and burns would reduce the protocol revenue available for public goods funding. I think that there is merit in considering sharing some of the sequencer revenue with tokenholders in the future once it increases, but probably the best way to do that is as part of the sequencer decentralisation.

It has already passed $1 trillion in total trading volume.   Ummm\u2026 that is an apples to oranges comparison. Uniswap is the bench mark of DEXs and pioneer of DEFI and the absolute benchmark for airdrops. Uniswap is the market leader and also the absolute GOAT in marketing. They had no comparable competitors at the time of airdrop launch and they set the standard for airdrops (which i must add that the airdrops that followed somehow keep missing the plot). Uniswap is in almost in every chain! They also had the first to market advantage in DEFI/SWAPS/AIRDROPS. They dont have to buyback and burn because its already staked with most leader pairs in the world. So comparing Optimism to UNI is not a fair comparison. Optimism is great but we have a long way to go. We are currently sitting at less 300 million USD MC. I would also like to reiterate the marketing angle since we are already here discussing UNI. UNI was propelled to its place by the surprise airdrop they did. They were incredibly popular and garnered so much popularity and along with that came success (granted there weren\u2019t airdrop farmers because it was a surprise). I am beginning to notice a pattern here and I would later try to make a quantitative argument for it. What I am noticing is projects that were too hell bent on \u201cremoving Sybillers\u201d  have in fact performed poorly as opposed to the ones who didn\u2019t. This is not a debate about whether or not filtering airdrop farmers is good or bad rather this is strictly an observation. In theory airdrop farmers \u201cdo\u201d the qualifying work means that they have contributed the project by using it (of course their intentions are debatable). Sybillers or not those who will dump will always dump and those who will buy will always buy. So the markets eventually balances things out.  In the process of all these stringent filtering and anti price growth sentiment is just bad marketing at the end of the day. ",

How do we make sure that $OP does not just become another worthless governance token? Here\u2019s an idea: A token that generates $ETH for stakeholders (or stakers) while simultaneously burning itself EIP-1559 style with every transaction. Here\u2019s how it would work in theory: Users transact on Optimism > Gas fees are paid in $ETH > L1 Fees are subtracted > Leftover fees get added to the treasury > the treasury uses 20-30% of $ETH generated to buy and burn $OP > 70-80% of the $ETH fees that\u2019s left gets spread across staked $OP tokens. This way, the Optimism economy is perpetually rewarding itself as usage grows, while being able to incentivize growth with a token that has created a \u201cvalue\u201d loop as antidote to the worthless governance token sickness. Assets that generate $ETH for their holders will significantly outperform in the long run imo. $OP can either become one of these assets or eventually be vampire attacked by an anon team.

While this may look like the most uniform and best way to go, some users have rightfully pointed out that this mechanism is terrible for value accrual towards the $OP token itself.  The reason for this is because Optimism\u2019s security still comes from Mainnet Ethereum. Hence the fees for this security need to be paid in Ether.

More DAI creation via Maker Vaults = more stability fees paid/revenue to the protocol. If there are more fees that means MKR holders are making good decisions on managing the protocol, from setting fees, on-boarding collaterals and managing risk (to name a few parameters). Poor governance decisions would then = less revenue and less burning of MKR. Increase in MKR price has not always correlated with burning and there is currently a divide in the community on re-starting the burn (which was voted on to pause in order to increase the surplus buffer to a larger size for growth objectives and risk management). Regardless of ones view to burn or not to burn, the more important issue is that once there is an  expectation to burn OP tokens as part of the system mechanics, it will be very complicated for the community  to undue that promise should it turn out not to be the best technique long term.

If we provide a mechanism whereby token holders benefit from increased economic activity in the ecosystem, then they will be incented to take governance seriously and support proposals that enable growth.

No its not our job to punish people who sold. This whole witch hunt vibe is just killing popularity and in this market we need all the positivity and popularity.   I\u2019m not just responding to you. Great example of someone that thinks this tread revolves around one person. I was just making a point that this is just another proposal that is focused solely on token go up, which it is. You can write paragraphs that say otherwise, but that\u2019s just a bunch of words saying nothing but how do we make token go up.   Again, this is not about pumping the token. Its about increasing the market share so $OP can be better positioned. Only way to communicate in this forum is to use words and mean it. Thats how productive communication goes; saying you never meant it is not a good defense to invalidate another\u2019s statement. ",

Show me the incentives and I will show you the outcome.   Improves incentives for new ecosystem participants:  Optimism is actively utilizing $OP tokens to incentivize ecosystem growth, both through future airdrops and allocations to ecosystem protocols for distribution.  But if that $OP token is of minimal value, the incentive for users to move liquidity to $OP diminishes.  L2\u2019s will be an intensely competitive landscape where network effects (liquidity) are critically important for future growth.  Creating a mechanism to enable $OP to accrue value is an important competitive lever for the ecosystem.   If we allocate 20% of profits to a buyback program and 80% to public goods, I ultimately believe we will be able to grow the ecosystem and fund more public goods than we otherwise would have, to the benefit of Optimism and the broader Ethereum ecosystem (would be good to put numbers around this assumption, of course).
