I am security auditor and I often face with clients who have require(amount > 0, \"prohibited\");  in their erc-20 token implementation. It looks intuitive, that indeed, transfer for zero amount makes not sense.   Why EIP-20 states \u201cMUST\u201d for allowing such transfers? What is the rationale behind?   What is the risk if you prohibit transfer for zero amount?   My proposal is to add sich rationale inside EIP-20 standard to avoid confusion and incompliency ",
