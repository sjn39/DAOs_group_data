Upsides  It gets compensation into the hands of Recognised Delegates sooner than waiting for the monthly governance process. It allows us to adjust the system over the three months as necessary to attract and compensate delegates. If it fails in a corruptive way (attracting low-quality delegates solely interested in compensation,) we can allow it to lapse after 3 months.  Downsides  Blurs the line between governance processes. Doesn\u2019t give Recognised Delegates much stability with respect to future compensation.     Should we trial Recognised Delegate compensation as described in MIP61 over the next 3 months?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Assuming this signal request and subsequent on-chain poll pass, compensation will cover November - February. Next Steps This signal poll will end on 2021-10-21T00:00:00Z, at which point if there are more \u2018Yes\u2019 votes than \u2018No\u2019 votes, it will move to an on-chain poll. ",

With that in mind, I figured I\u2019d explain my reasoning for my vote on this trial while we wait for optimal gas pricing.  Yes \u2014 Reasoning It\u2019s just trial, at the end we can determine if it succeeded, failed, or needs revision. More importantly, delaying this is a bad idea, we\u2019ve been talking about compensation for months and we\u2019re losing our better-performing delegates. We could barely pass the recent exec which is no bueno. With that in mind, I\u2019m gonna vote yes for the trial in the hopes that we can come up with a more sophisticated model. (Look at that! Cautious optimism playing out in real-time folks!) If MKR holders choose to vote this poll down that\u2019s ok by me too.  Compensation model comments     LongForWisdom:  This  still-active signal request   This SR for outsized pay is only missing one part of the model: commitment. I\u2019ll go post over there too. I believe that as a community we can come up with a structure that takes MIP61 and captures most delegates\u2019 desired involvement. From there we create minimum performance commitments with compensation that adjusts well. I personally never wanted to go full-time as a delegate, so if I\u2019m streamed something unreasonable as a result of today\u2019s MKR shuffling, I\u2019m just going to give it back to the DAO. ",
