Excess ETH/WBTC beyond 100% is not owned by the protocol and thus not part of redeem-ability. Maybe some more thorough explanations will help. ",

Some people and media will always do that. It\u2019s not a good argument to make information less accessible to those who would benefit from seeing it. I agree it\u2019s a fools errand to keep explaining it, and that\u2019s why it should be more prominent, on it\u2019s own dedicated URL: whatbacksmydai.com or something. Such a page can clearly explain the benefits and drawbacks of DAI being partially backed by centralized stablecoins, and can be a marketing and growth tool. \u201cYour stablecoin isn\u2019t backed by centralized stablecoins, eh? Well then, what is it backed by, and how can users see that on a real-time basis? Cause you can see Maker\u2019s here, we have nothing to hide.\u201d ",

A more detailed chart like the one that was shown on backeddai.makerdao.network on a separate page is a great idea, will look into it. ",
