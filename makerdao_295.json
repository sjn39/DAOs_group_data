I don\u2019t hate it, i pretty like it actually and the tutoriel could be better. What i mean is for new coming user change their theme. Must be hard for them and to make things easier, we could manage to make the post a little better and do a better tutorial on how to install themes properly. Good work and good post, i think MakerDAO need some changes and colors. Thanks to include me in the feedback, much appreciate. ",
