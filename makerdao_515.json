Like clockwork - another week, another 12.3 million Dai bridged to Avalanche. That said, the chain\u2019s overall growth has finally seemed to plateau.  AVAX TVL1381\u00d7383 132 KB  Pleateau\u2019d to the tune of 11.5 billion, but still. The week also came with a few shakeups in the AVAX ecosystem. Most notably, the rapid decline of the Blizz Finance money market. Blizz was forked from Fantom\u2019s Geist, which was, itself, forked from Compound. The Frankenstein project\u2019s launch was a resounding success, utilizing the same tokenomics as Geist to lure in users with sparkly, gilded APY\u2019s. Put simply, rather than a utility token, the developers opted for a farm token. At its peak, Blizz held $1.3 billion. Now it\u2019s hanging on to its last $246 million. In its place, the remaining three AVAX money markets have continued to thrive, though Aave has solidified itself as leader of the pack.     Project TVL Dai Liquidity Dai borrowed     Aave 2.92 bil 327,555,490 833,749,178   Trader Joe 1.76 bil 3,485,397 1,847,993   Benqi 1.59 bil 150,040,000 546,050,000    So, Aave and Benqi are being used like traditional borrowing/lending protocols, while Trader Joe is operating more like a pit-stop. Users are taking advantage of the APY\u2019s offered through the Avalanche Rush program to farm AVAX and xJOE, the project\u2019s governance token, but not taking advantage of the borrowing side. That said, it\u2019s worth noting that Trader Joe began as a DEX, and still features the farms and LPs that make up the bulk of their product. Moving outside the top projects, the network has seen an influx of \u201cto-be-released\u201d Play-to-Earn projects. Crabada seems to be receiving the most hype, offering \u201cPVP-infused idle gameplay\u201d with breeding mechanics reminiscent of Axie Infinity. AVAX now holds over 593 million Dai, or around 6.63% of the total supply.  Current Events  Avalanche Summit in Barcelona from March 22nd through the 27th    Binance Smart Chain I mentioned it last week, but if I were to make a scale on the accuracy of reported data, BSC would represent the absolute lowest point on it - and if it were mathematically possible, I\u2019d put it even lower. The top Dai holding wallets have changed very little in the past 6 months, with various Binance hot wallets holding the overwhelming on-chain majority. The 261.9 million Dai dictated by the BSC network represents around 2.82% of the total supply.  Current Events  Third Largest BSC protocol, Tranchess, launches a BSC validator node    Fantom With a new local ATH of over $7 bil in TVL and climbing, the network was sure to see a few shakeups. The biggest came in the rise, fall, re-rise - and finally, the slow, agonizing decline of Geist.  917\u00d7435 54.6 KB  A farm disguised as a money market, on my internet? Like its forked cousin Blizz, as APY\u2019s normalized, users exited the platform in droves. The primary benefactors have been SpookySwap and SCREAM. SpookySwap is Fantom\u2019s top DEX and offers a full suite of unique features. It utilizes the Anyswap bridge in-app allowing users to easily bridge to and from the network, heavily features its DAI-FTM pool, and recently released an \"expert trader mode\" akin to what you\u2019d see on centralized exchanges. SCREAM is a money market that functions similarly to Yearn, but with the functionality that comes with a borrowing/lending protocol. Along with the usual stablecoin and blue-chip deposits, SCREAM offers competitive returns on governance tokens like CRV and SPELL. The platform currently offers some of the highest DAI deposit rewards on the network, though borrowing rates are still quite high. Fantom now holds roughly 331 million DAI or 3.501% of the total supply.

The previous governance token, STAKE, is in the process of being swapped to Gnosis\u2019 GNO token. The underlying tokenomics look much the same, and wxDAI will remain the chain\u2019s primary transaction token. With the Gnosis merger, the chain has realigned its focus to building the digital infrastructure necessary to facilitate real-world adoption.   Superfluid is a payment-streaming service that aims to remedy the growing need for a reliable method for paying contributors and employees in cryptocurrency.  RealT allows users to buy into \u201cfractional, tokenized properties\u201d across the globe.  The above protocols have continued to grow, seeing 7-day TVL increases of 16.24% and 7.98% respectively. Regardless of how you feel about the new direction, the chain will be an interesting one to watch, both for real-world adoption and as a potential scalability solution for the Ethereum base layer. The newly re-monikered Gnosis Chain is the proud owner of over 53 million DAI or around 0.56% of the total supply.  Current Events  Additional information on the GNO/STAKE merger and token-swap    Polygon After a loud Spring and quiet Fall, Polygon has forced itself back into the spotlight, posting a positive net inflow every single day this year.  1388\u00d7451 19.1 KB  While its overall growth is still lagging behind some of its competitors, Dai usage has exploded. The NFT market might be capturing a majority of the network activity, but for our purposes, all that matters is DeFi. Balancer and Quickswap have captured the majority of the recent volume, and despite the December turmoil, Sushiswap\u2019s been no slouch either.  923\u00d7282 40.6 KB  Zooming out, Balancer saw parabolic growth throughout December, leading to 48.9% share of the Dai circulating through Poly DEX\u2019s. As a whole, Polygon currently holds over 430 million DAI, good for 4.55% of the total supply.  Current Events  With the announcement of Plonky2, zkSNARKs are coming to Polygon    Up-and-Comers  Aurora The Aurora chain is being marketed as the NEAR protocol\u2019s \u201clayer-2-esque scaling solution\u201d, in other words, like Optimism or Arbitrum, the chain is secured by layer-1 NEAR. Aurora, like its mother chain, is EVM-compliant and offers rapid transaction speed and finality. The chain\u2019s top project is Trisolaris, a recently launched DEX, but the top DAI wallet is Rose, holding around 76% of Dai bridged to Aurora. Another unique aspect of not just the Aurora chain, but the NEAR ecosystem as a whole, is how it plans to generate its userbase. While all of its competitors offered extravagant liquidity mining programs, NEAR opted to build a team of strong developers by hosting an $800 million grant program. The chain has a limited dapp menu - but $800 mil says that\u2019s soon to change. Aurora currently plays host to just over 5 million Dai or around 0.053% of the total supply.  Optimism For the past month total Dai circulating the Optimistic network has been slightly off\u2026 by around 10 million Dai. As noted in a recent Signal Request, in early December, a user mistakenly sent 10mil Dai to a burn address. Fortunately, @csmith of the @Protocol-Engineering-Core-Unit followed up with a plan to recover the lost DAI. The transaction decreased DAI\u2019s total supply on Optimism but didn\u2019t affect the recorded balance on layer-1 Ethereum. This means that the lost Dai can be transferred from escrow via the Governance Pause Proxy contract, while still maintaining equilibrium between Ethereum layer-1\u2019s transaction records and Optimism layer-2\u2019s. First, a shoutout to PE for continuing to go above and beyond, and for the absurd degree of innovation and ingenuity that goes into these rescue missions. Now, the freshly updated total: Optimism now holds 38,277,469.42 million Dai or around 0.4% of the total supply.

I\u2019ll dig into more in next week\u2019s edition, but of the listed networks, Arbitrum is definitely the most fleshed-out. Optimism is still, for the most part, dominated by Uniswap and Synthetix, and Lyra.

While it has to plateau eventually (\u2026right?), the consistent week-over-week growth has been a legitimate spectacle. The chain now has four projects topping 1 billion TVL:  Aave Trader Joe Benqi Curve  With three active money markets and the Curve liquidity machine working as a cog, users have continued to race to Avalanche\u2019s EVM-compliant C-Chain. AVAX currently houses over 580 million Dai or around 6.24% of the total supply.  Current Events  https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1478875863953428483 https://twitter.com/SynapseProtocol/status/1477827354365935619    Binance Smart Chain From a tracking standpoint, Binance has been a complete mystery. On August 12, 2021, BSC held 262.23 million Dai. Today that total is 262.05 million Dai - an absolutely parabolic -0.07% decrease over four months. What has changed significantly is the chain\u2019s active Dai wallets. In the same four months active addresses have grown by over 109%, from just over 40k to around 85k. Note that these totals aren\u2019t necessarily unique users. The 262.05 million dictated by the BSC network represents around 2.82% of the total supply.  Current Events  https://twitter.com/pinkecosystem/status/1476736350632222721    Fantom Fantom OPERA has seen its fair share of highs and lows this cycle, but despite the extreme variance in its token price - the chain\u2019s TVL has remained remarkably consistent.  1011\u00d7368 74.4 KB  Like Avalanche, Fantom is competing with rollups as Ethereum\u2019s preferred side-chain for decreasing base-layer congestion. Also like AVAX, the chain is EVM-compliant and offers rapid finality and minuscule transaction fees. But while both offer a suite of protocols ported straight from Ethereum, Fantom has invested more into its own - a strategy more focused on the long-term. Another unique Fantom feature (where MakerDAO is concerned) is DAI\u2019s place in its ecosystem. Dai and USDC are the premier stablecoins, integrated and widely used by nearly every DeFi application on the network. USDT, on the other hand, has been relegated to a wrapped token used by few. As an example, SpookySwap, the network\u2019s largest DEX, features zero USDT pools, while two of its largest utilized DAI and USDC. Curve also chose to deploy a 2pool on the network (DAI-USDC), as opposed to its standard 3-pool split (DAI-USDC-USDT). The side-chain wars are far from over, and while Fantom may or may not end up the top dog - DAI\u2019s future on the chain is looking bright. Fantom now holds roughly 300.4 million DAI or 3.228% of the total supply.  Current Events  What Are Andre Cronje and Daniele Sestagalli Building on Fantom? https://twitter.com/SpookySwap/status/1478010006243057668    Gnosis Chain (formerly xDAI) The xDAI STAKE chain has merged with Gnosis Protocol, resulting in the Gnosis Chain. The previous governance token, STAKE, is in the process of being swapped to Gnosis\u2019 GNO token. Thank you @Lozadaluis12 for the tip-off! The underlying tokenomics look much the same, and wxDAI will remain the chain\u2019s primary transaction token. With the Gnosis merger, the chain has realigned its focus to building the digital infrastructure necessary to facilitate real-world adoption.   Superfluid is a payment-streaming service that aims to remedy the growing need for a reliable method for paying contributors and employees in cryptocurrency.  RealT allows users to buy into \u201cfractional, tokenized properties\u201d across the globe.  Gnosis Chain is the proud owner of over 56 million DAI, a 35% monthly increase and good for around 0.61% of the total supply.  Current Events  Tornado Cash Nova, a beta aiming to extend user privacy to layer-2s, comes to Gnosis Chain Additional information on the GNO/STAKE merger    Polygon Polygon started the craze, quickly overtaking Binance as DAI\u2019s preferred side-chain in Q2 of last year, but it was short-lived. Its market share bled as users hopped to shinier, newer toys like AVAX and FTM, but December saw Polygon start to make serious strides towards closing the gap. Polygon currently holds over 412 million DAI, a 12% increase in the last 30 days, and good for 4.4% of the total supply.

The kerfluffle went public, and Celo saw a quick exodus - dropping from over 19 million circulating Dai to under 3 million in just 14 days. Fortunately for them, the ship is slowly stabilizing, as December saw a strong 97% increase in on-chain Dai. Celo now plays host to around 5.2 million Dai.  Harmony Harmony has steadily grown its bag of circulating DAI, and slowly but surely, applications have started to put it to use.   Euphoria is an OHM fork utilizing DAI (along with ONE) as backbone collateral in its treasury.  Viperswap is Harmony\u2019s top native DEX, and the main source for DAI LPs on the network.  That said, the largest dapp on the network, the gamified DEX DeFiKingdoms along with its 71.6% on-chain dominance, still offers no incentivized DAI pairs.
