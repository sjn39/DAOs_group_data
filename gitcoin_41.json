By: Kevin Owocki The Internet of Jobs (IoJ) is what happens when web3 (the internet of money) collides with the timeless exchange of labor for money. The median internet citizen thinks about their job, not their investments when they think about their financial life & financial sovereignty. NFTs, yield farming, and meme coins may offer a great way to vibe with the crypto community, but it\u2019s not enough for them to integrate crypto into their daily lives. For 99% of the world, their financial lives are their jobs - not their investments. For this reason, I predict that Web3 won\u2019t go mainstream until the internet of jobs is mainstream. Will the IoJ be peer-to-peer and less reliant on central intermediaries with unilateral control? Will it unbundle jobs into their composite parts - earning, learning, connecting? What will the fully mature IoJ look like? Read more about the internet of jobs here. What did we learn?  We embarked on a research project with the goal of answering one simple question: \u201cWhat pain points do DAOs experience with regards to different domains of talent and jobs?\u201d In the span of two weeks in February 2022, we interviewed workstream leads from GitcoinDAO and other external DAOs. We wanted to gain a deep understanding of how DAO\u2019s think about the different domains in the life cycle of talent (diagrammed below).  801\u00d7744 26.1 KB  The outcome we were looking for in that deep understanding was what of the above domains (source, onboard, match and retain) present us areas of opportunity due to consistent pain points across different DAO\u2019s. Hint: there were problems & consistency with those problems. We synthesized the above research and used that synthesis to boil the research down to 3 specific problem statements that showed ripeness for opportunity within the domains of talent.  Sourcing Talent  Problem Statement: DAO\u2019s are struggling to find quality talent for long term development needs due to the scattered talent pool filled with skilled web3.0 knowledge workers to meet their demands/needs.   Onboarding Talent:  Problem Statement: DAO\u2019s do not have ways to effectively onboard potential talents without manual intervention, which makes it difficult for potential talents to know how to get started and where to get the right resources   Matching Talent:  Problem Statement: DAO\u2019s do not have ways to match talent with work at scale. There\u2019s no easy and unified way to display the work available. It\u2019s also difficult to identify and vet talent (DAO leaders would love to move away from traditional resumes, but we still don\u2019t know what the better alternatives are!)    Eventually we will want to address each problem statement, but as we all know context shifting can be less than ideal. Getting Started To ensure we have a specific focus, we wanted to prioritize one of the domains and its problem statements to proceed with experimentation.  801\u00d7744 26.2 KB  After synthesizing our research we decided to prioritize the Matching domain, which is highlighted above. Here\u2019s why: Web3 companies are hiring more than ever, related job postings grew almost 400% over the last year, according to LinkedIn. That translated to more developers joining Web3 in 2021 than any previous year by over 4,000 developers. One last number to paint a picture, ~ triple the amount of part time contributors then there are full time contributors in the Web3 ecosystem. We are seeing a huge shift of talent coming into Web3 + more of that talent being part time then full time. So the question becomes how do we onboard the continued influx of new talent & part time contributors to full time and meaningful work. This problem surfaced itself through our research and we see it day to day within GitcoinDAO. We have an influx of talent, but struggle to keep up with that influx and continue to struggle on how we efficiently and effectively onboard them to meaningful + valuable work. We believe this would involve identifying who those new talents and part-time contributors are (what skills they have, what \u201cproof of work\u201d they have, etc.), and matching them with the right work at scale. If we could unlock the potential of every contributor of a DAO, DAOs can create more impact. What\u2019s Next Now that we have our focus point, let us tell you what we are going to do to address this problem. To paint a simple picture, we have broken down our process into a strategy, goals and outcomes. Strategy:  Validate that the prioritized problem is a problem for a wider set of DAO\u2019s Generate a wide set of ideas/potential solutions that could potentially solve the problem statement Prioritize ideas to be built as rapid prototypes Build prototypes based on generated list of ideas Experiment with prototypes to determine problem - solution fit  Goal:  Experiment with 1 or more prototypes that potentially solves the onboarding problem  Invalidating the product concept would still be considered success    The Outcome: Make a decision about whether the prototype(s) addressing the onboarding problem should:  Spin out for GTM & on-going development Determine no further opportunity exists and end R&D in this area Iterate on a different concept for the problem space  The Ask Interested in the IoJ space? We\u2019d love to get your feedback on the prioritized problem statement above and the next steps: do they resonate with you? What else would you like to see, and what could be improved? One more ask from us: if you have friends or colleagues who are leading a DAO, we\u2019d love to speak with them! We\u2019d like to further research on the pain points of leading a DAO and validate problems/solutions. If you have any feedback, questions or concerns feel free drop them as comments on this gov post, or reach us on Discord: willsputra | Gitcoin#7177 ChaseADragan#8602 Future Updates Interested in keeping up-to-date with the progress of the IoJ workstream? We\u2019ll be posting minor updates within this gov post, and any major movement or updates will be reflected in new gov posts on gov.gitcoin.co. ",

I also think this may not be DAO specific and could just be a part of starting anything new. I wonder what the \u201ctalent\u201d entering Web3 feels like the onboarding and retention process is like. It can be a confusing and hectic space. Do they have an easy time finding a place? Do they feel like they\u2019re adding value? Why don\u2019t a lot of them stick around? I think lots of people coming from corporations or startups may be used to workplaces with much more structure and directive, rather than the often fluid and emergent nature of DAOs. This probably scares a lot of people off who are looking for clear organization, to be told what to do, to start working and earning immediately. Yet, if they stick around, they might find there are so many upsides to working for DAOs: you can work on multiple things that interest you, you can take initiative, you can be free from working for someone and really work for yourself. How do you teach talent to lead and manage themselves quickly enough that they don\u2019t give up on DAOs? ",

I think your comment greatly lays out pain points that we should be considering as we march forward on better ways to match talent to valuable work, and vice versa I love the question you mention of do they feel like they are adding value? The prioritized problem space we want to explore is finding ways to help identify who a DAO has as talent and match them to the value add work that DAO\u2019s may have. If we can help organize the DAO, their value add work and who/what skill sets are available, we could streamline talent finding ways to add value. I think to your last question, we need to provide tools that benefit both the DAO and talent to efficiently match the talent to valuable work. If we can have DAO members easily find work that is valuable to them and the DAO, then they should be able to self organize and start adding value with minimal manual intervention/direction from a \u201cboss\u201d . On the flip side, if DAO\u2019s can easily match talent to their known priorities, it should streamline that match as well. Let me know if that resonates with you, and am always happy to continue conversating on this topic! ",
