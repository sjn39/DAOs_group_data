                    "content": "The Problem. The design of the delegation system hinders the UNI holders\u2019 ability to express their will. Currently, delegating your votes makes almost no sense. If you want the delegate to vote for you, you have to trust him/her blindly. If you try to vote for or against the first proposal, you find a message:  \u201cOnly UNI votes that were self delegated or delegated to another address before block 11042288 are eligible for voting.\u201d  So it works like a snapshot. And if you disagree with the voting decision of your delegate, you can do nothing. This system creates an opportunity for collusion among the delegates. The safer way to make changes within the current system is to use autonomous proposals. And if you want to vote - you have to vote yourself. This safer way is not inclusive, though. It gets expensive to vote for smaller UNI holders, and it\u2019s not easy to create a proposal. Having a sound delegate system does have a role. \u2018Voting\u2019 delegates could act as political parties. \u2018Proposing\u2019 delegates could help the community to put the most desired proposals up to vote. Currently, delegators just deprive themselves of the opportunity to express disagreement with the delegate\u2019s decisions. == The Solution. I propose to implement two practices:  the preparation period the ability to revoke the vote.  The preparation period is the time when you\u2019re able to assess the proposal without being able to vote on it. It is also an opportunity for auditors to do their job and warn the community if something is wrong with the code. The ability to revoke the vote. Ideally, the delegators should be able to revoke their vote until the voting is closed, even if the delegate has already cast it. If there\u2019s no way to make the casted vote revokable, there should at least be an opportunity to revoke the vote before it has been cast. This way, even though with additional friction, the well-intentioned delegates would be able to allow the delegators who disagree with their decision to withdraw their voting power. If we can\u2019t realize the ability to revoke the vote for technical reasons, then we need to expand the preparation period. Borderline is that we need to have mechanisms that allow voters to respond to the proposals and decisions of the delegates in regard to them.    Should we introduce the preparation period?  Yes No Neutral Not Sure     0 voters        Should delegators have an option to revoke their votes?  Yes No Neutral Not sure     0 voters     ",

If we couldn\u2019t introduce the ability to revoke the votes, introducing the preparation period would still solve some of the issues of the present system:  Delegates could announce their votes before the preparation period ends.

I\u2019ll quote @Agusx1211 from another topic:  This proposal has been made when the total delegated UNI was around 43m, however right now there is almost 74m delegated UNI.  So the proposal has been made when 43m out of 185m of UNI was able to vote. If the system worked in a way that all circulating UNI could vote, reaching the quorum would be much easier. And it\u2019s an infinitely better solution than reducing the quorum from 4% to 3%. Because this way everyone is able to participate. Currently, the majority of UNI holders can\u2019t. So decreasing the quorum while having the majority of votes excluded from the process just brings more weight towards the already delegated votes. It effectively increases the weight of big delegates instead of democratizing the process. == Also, let\u2019s take a look at the UNI release schedule. As you can see, by march 2021 there will be 300 mln UNI. Even we keep the present system and the current ratio of delegated votes, it would leave us with 120 mln UNI able to vote. And this is an overly conservative estimate in my opinion. It is quite easy to reach the 40 mln quorum when even 120 mln UNI are able to vote, don\u2019t you think? ",

                    "content": "People do revoke their votes in real politics when they go out on the streets and overthrow the government. Plato viewed democracy as a vicious form of governance and cherished aristocracy. The current discussion, though, has nothing to do neither with Greek Athens nor with American elections. Uniswap governance is about approving or disapproving the changes to the code the swapping protocol operates on. It also is about the distribution of the governance treasury and the fees the platform accrues. So as Uniswap governance is quite limited in what it does, analogies with real politics do not quite fit here. What does fit, though, are real and possible scenarios of how voting could turn out. Let\u2019s take a look at some examples:   You vote on day 1 for a proposal, and on day 3, auditors find out that the proposal you\u2019ve voted for contains a critical bug that will freeze all the money deposited to Uniswap LP contracts. Would you still prefer not to have an option to revoke your vote?   You\u2019ve delegated your voting power to a well-intentioned delegate because you wanted to support creating a particular proposal. Then another proposal comes up where you strongly disagree with the delegate\u2019s decision, as it affects your financial interests negatively. Even though in this scenario both of you are well-intentioned, there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop your delegate from voting the opposite way you\u2019d like him/her to.   When it comes to ill-intentioned delegates, things become worse, as they can collude and take advantage of the blind trust you grant them.   ",

In democratic regimes, if the people aren\u2019t happy with the governance of their delegates, in the NEXT elections they can change their mind and vote against them and bring other delegates who believe that they will be better. However, when in any time people are revoking arbitrarily the authority given that can lead to dictatorships. All the dictators who \u201crevolted\u201d against the established governments claimed exactly the same thing. That they revolted because they dont agree with the current authority who are useless. And trust me they do so by manipulating the crowds. We are either going to have law and order and democracy or ochlocracy where anyone can change his mind or manipulate the crowds for his own interest at any given time. If someone wants to revoke his vote, he can do it in the NEXT elections not in any random given time. And according to the rulebook, elections are only held in specific periods. ",
