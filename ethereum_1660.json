                    "content": "Hey there, We are considering developing a new NFT standard - shareable NFTs.  Motivation Regular NFTs often represent real-world objects that can change the owner in a regular way (person A gives the object to person B) and transferring of NFT reflects this action. Shareable NFTs are intended to represent a virtual world object that can be shared between persons - e.g. a song, blog article, digital art or contribution to a open source project. These virtual world objects cannot be \u201cmoved\u201d or \u201ctransfered\u201d the same way as real world objects (therefore regular transferable NFTs don\u2019t properly reflect their nature), but these types of items can be shared/copied - here we suggest shareable NFTs to represent these items and their natural behavior.  Sharing mechanics We envision two possible types of NFT sharing: open and permissioned sharing.  Open sharing With open sharing a shareable NFT can be shared by anyone - this is suitable for NFTs representing publicly available items and the act of sharing can serve as an endorsement of the item.  Permissioned sharing In this case only the original holder of the NFT could share it with someone else. This can cover use-cases such as acknowledging others that helped you receive a badge or recognition NFT. We are also considering making these shareable NFTs non-transferable.  Questions Do you think these would be meaningful use-cases? Do you have any thoughts on the implementation? ",

When we simulate a scene, Mike Jackon released a \u201cHeal THE WORLD\u201d, casting 10 NFTs to sell, 10 NFT owners can listen \u201cHEAL THE WORLD\u201d, because rare and because of Mike Jackson\u2019s works, inevitable Very value. But this is not in line with reality, because everyone can listen to music, should not be just 10 people\u2019s power. In order to meet the reality, let more people hear \u201cHEAL THE WORLD\u201d, then need to release more NFT, when NFT is more than a certain degree, not a NFT will be valuable, because their content is the same, Then there is alternative. Map to reality, my music disc is the same, we can do exchange, I believe that most people don\u2019t mind, because digital collection does not have depreciation and wear aging. And each NFT content is the same, repeated issuance not only waste resources, but also let NFT lose each of them is unique. And the shared NFT is perfectly solved. NFT is a disc record, then shared NFT is streaming media music. This is not only applicable in music fields, but also novels, film and so on, there are too many imagination space! And you can share NFT to solve the current copyright issue, and different music software is deployed without the copyright of the music artist, causing users to download a variety of music software. When the music artist passes the NFT direct connection, it will need a platform to connect to both sides. Because the platform is only responsible for providing NFT sharing, do not own NFT, this NFT is still in the music artist, so the platform will not form monopoly. Regarding its business value, you can get a payment for a payment for life by consumer collection, or the actual situation chooses a lifetime enjoy, or subscribe. In order to avoid a wallet payment, public key can be used, and the mortgage can be used. There must be a certain number of valuable loops on the wallet. When the private key is disclosed, it will be done to transfer the loop, in order to avoid the loss of the money. There should be no one will be willing to open the key (of course there is a problem here: there is already a fraud that is intended to reveal the private key, so that there are many valuable Currency, there is no original coin as GAS, when you should Address payment, native parties will be transferred immediately by contract) The above solution is not perfect, but I have to admit that the shared NFT is very cool, it is supplemented with the existing NFT.

You can find it from here Shareable NFT eip draft by yaruno \u00b7 Pull Request #5023 \u00b7 ethereum/EIPs \u00b7 GitHub. Sharing is an interesting concept as it can be thought and perceived in different ways as well as it can be implemented in various ways. For example, when we talk about sharing we can think about it is as digital copying, giving a copy of a digital resource while retaining a version by ourselves. Sharing can also be fractional, though it may be interesting how that could be doable with indivisible tokens, or sharing could be about giving rights to use a certain resource. Depending on are we sharing the pie, growing the pie or splicing the pie the different implementations of sharing would benefit from an abstraction level higher definition e.g. EIP-5023 that defines an interface which elaborates that shareable tokens should have a method of Share and an event of Share defining what was shared and to whom.

I would imagine it be useful to share NFTs if say the NFT represent ownership of a house, then shared ownership could be implemented by a contact owning the ownership NFT and distributing $HOME tokens that represent shared of said NFT. of course the drawback is the NFT is held by a contact, but perhaps this idea could be expanded.
