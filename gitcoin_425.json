I think that this formation of proposals are blocking other non-related ideas to be evaluated. It almost seems like the AKITA community is trying to take control of the platform and I don\u2019t think its fair. I\u2019m a Binance Smart Chain enthusiast and I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m allowed to make more than one proposal related to BSC but for the sake of the Gitcoin community I limited my proposal related to BSC to just one which I think the AKITA community should also abide to  .

The post explains the author's perspective and suggests that the AKITA community should limit their proposals to one, similar to the author's proposal related to Binance Smart Chain. The post also invites feedback and constructive criticism on the proposal and raises questions about the fairness of the current proposal formation.",
