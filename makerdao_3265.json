I will go first with Fantom (FTM) and Fusion (FSN).  I hear a lot of chirping about Solana as well (SOL) but that doesn\u2019t really count as under the radar but should still get added later via bridges, same with VeChain (VET) as these two are already well into the top 50.  Anyway, feel free to share your thoughts on what you have come across out there in crypto-land.  Note that with bridges in place not all of these need to be native to Ethereum (Bitcoin isn\u2019t and we made that work). ",
