                    "content": "I was quite inspired by the imToken 2 security quiz: https://twitter.com/mr_ligi/status/1024691441115774976 Wonder now if it perhaps even would be a great idea to use the security experience tokens that the quiz generates to unlock wallet features like:  receiving more than X sending more than Y signing transactions with data signing arbitrary data \u2026  And perhaps also a backup could give you security experience tokens and more for the verification of the backup. Also there could be one intentionally vulnerable faucet that can give you unlimited security experience tokens Last but not least: I think we should build a opensource/creative commons database of such questions - unfortunately imToken is closed source so we cannot directly build on top of that. But if every wallet needs to come up with the whole set of security questions - it takes a lot of time. But if every project in this ring just contributes one question - then we already have a great base. We are already 17 Projects in this ring with even more representatives  And as often the first step is the hardest I started with the first question here:    github.com    walleth/security_quiz Collection of Ethereum security quiz questions. Contribute to walleth/security_quiz development by creating an account on GitHub.      When writing the second question it became even clearer how much we need a shared language / glossary between apps as we discussed once @boris. E.g. shoul one call it  \u201cseed phrase\u201d, \u201cmnemonic\u201d , \u201c12 words\u201d , \u2026 Having different words for basically the same thing can really confuse users and also might prevent them from answering the questions in this quiz correctly ",

I would like to add that imToken/Wallet apps and MEW are fundamentally different from the user perspective and therefore would need different approaches regarding education, if at all. MEW is \u2018one-time use interface\u2019 vs. wallet apps are \u2018one time setup and then use\u2019. In MEW the education assessment therefore shows repeatedly and for experienced users vs. wallets, where it shows one time.  also the timing is really important  In imToken you are able to use the app without taking the quiz, but with limited capabilities. When you e.g. get to the point where you want to add an additional wallet address, you will get reminded to take the quiz. Again, not optimal, but better than a popup on first app start IMO. ",

Still we\u2019d need to force users to have fun. The wallet app should take new users through the app - Force new users to make a transaction and exchange a (worthless) token. And at certain views, it explains the concept of private & public keys, etc. Users wouldn\u2019t be able to skip the tutorial. It could be made fun, too - depending on the target group. Could be a mascot, \u00e0 la Clippy, guiding users through the app. @p0s i am sure, Chinese would love a mascot. ",
