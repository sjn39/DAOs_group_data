                    "content": "I\u2019ve received a lot of requests to update the DCF I shared six months so wanted to provide the community with an updated model. There have been some major changes over the past six months, including:  Blended interest rates for the portfolio falling from 3.8% to 1% Stablecoin exposure increasing from 26% to 48% Higher DAI minting than expected (assumed $5.96B in prior model, now $9B expected by YE) Stability fee income lower by 47%  Assumptions:  REVISED: Profit margins increased in almost every year due to lower than expected expense run-rate Long-term Interest Spread remains at 2% - though we are currently half of this today, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect this to increase as Staked ETH and Real World Assets are onboarded (could be even higher if markets strengthen) Discount Rate remains at 40%.  Output:  Fair MKR price increased from $4,385 to $6,643 despite market price falling from $4,610 to $2,300 over the same time period 2030 price increased from $53,297 to $88,228  As a reminder, I would highly encourage anyone accessing this model to come up with their own assumptions and inputs. There is a lot of room for improvement in the model as well if anyone wants to take up the reins of updating  .

Do you have a WACC calculation because I can\u2019t seem to find one? What is the logic behind the YoY growth for 2022? A gradual decline in yearly growth from 23 forward seems reasonable, but I\u2019m curious about the growth for '22. Hope to have a productive discussion of parameters. ",
