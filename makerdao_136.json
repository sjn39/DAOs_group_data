This will be done on Optimism and Arbitrum:  address guy = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;      AuthLike(l2Dai).rely(guy);     AuthLike(l2Dai).deny(guy);  This will test the configuration of L2 components, including the governance relay and L2 DAI by calling the following addresses: // L2 Test Spells     address constant OPTIMISM_L1_GOVERNANCE_RELAY         = 0x09B354CDA89203BB7B3131CC728dFa06ab09Ae2F;     address constant OPTIMISM_L2_SPELL                    = 0x71d75C3D100D14d4db0cE7a83d0De48ecEC32D19;     address constant ARBITRUM_L1_GOVERNANCE_RELAY         = 0x9ba25c289e351779E0D481Ba37489317c34A899d;     address constant ARBITRUM_L2_SPELL                    = 0xAeFc25750d8C2bd331293076E2DC5d5ad414b4a2;   By doing so, the executive will perform an L2 noop (no-operation) spell that rely's the 0x0 address to test that Governance has full control. // Perform a Test Spell on Optimism         OptimismL1GovernanceRelayLike(OPTIMISM_L1_GOVERNANCE_RELAY).relay(             OPTIMISM_L2_SPELL,                /* target */             abi.encodeWithSignature(\"act()\"), /* targetData */             3000000                           /* l2gas */         );          // Perform a Test Spell on Arbitrum         ArbitrumL1GovernanceRelayLike(ARBITRUM_L1_GOVERNANCE_RELAY).relay(             ARBITRUM_L2_SPELL,                /* target */             abi.encodeWithSignature(\"act()\"), /* targetData */             680168429264,                     /* l1CallValue */             0,                                /* maxGas */             0,                                /* gasPriceBid */             680168429264                      /* maxSubmissionCost */         );  Once the above is confirmed, PECU will manually deny its deployer address, ensuring that going forward, Governance will be the only authority retaining  control of the token bridge.
