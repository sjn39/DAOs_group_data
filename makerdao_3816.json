I know some CUs have taken to LLC incorporation as means of avoiding being classed and liable as general partnerships. As I understand it, there is currently little to no legal merit in the US law system, to argue that a DAO itself does not constitute some form of unincorporated partnership. This means, there is a currently slim, but still real chance, that token holders can be held jointly and severally liable In the case of litigation, which may legally endanger not just on chain assets, but their off chain personal assets as well. I am concerned that this could become major problem down the road for many DAOs, especially their deanonymized members, if any sufficiently resourced and blockchain saavy organization takes the route of litigation. I was wondering if there has been any conclusive settlement or discussion on a course of action around minimizing GPL risks for US MKR holders, especially as the MKR foundation, which previously held most of the attention for any legal attack, is set to dissolve soon. I get that there is little legal framework or case law around the topic, but that might be all the more reason to be proactive about engaging with legal organizations and policy makers (if this isn\u2019t already happening around the topic).

Quiet:   Who is registered as LLC owners? As far as I\u2019m aware, US law requires legal names and other KYC level info for incorporation. How do they resolve that?    Generally the corporate services vendor will form the entity (as the sole incorporator for a corporation or the authorized person for an LLC) and promptly thereafter appoint an initial director of a corporation or an initial member for an LLC and then resign. Here, it looks like they are using a relatively new LLC type called a \u2018series LLC\u2019. To be totally frank, this is probably not the best solution for this situation. As far as I can tell, the initial member for each new series LLC under the \u2018master LLC\u2019 (which is owned by OtoCo as far as I can tell) is just an ethereum address. That\u2019s not going to work for most reputable service providers, and it will certainly not work for opening opening bank accounts. It\u2019s possible that you may be able to change the name of the member via off-chain, normal legal documents or perhaps add a new member, but at that point why not just use the normal process of going through a corporate services vendor? Moreover, it\u2019s just too new and unfamiliar. The current formulation of series LLCs (\u2018registered LLC\u2019, vs the prior \u2018protected LLC\u2019) was approved for use in Delaware in 2019.  \u201cAs of November 13th, 2019, Delaware reported that 80 series LLCs had been registered.\u201d Source  Here\u2019s a detailed look at the pros/cons/future of registered LLCs if you really want to get into it, but the long and short of it is banks, accountants, lawyers are unfamiliar with these. Only around a majority of states allow for their formation. This will increase costs at every step, and moreover, reduce legitimacy. Just take a look at the Wikipedia page below, which references an IRS law/regulation \u201cthat should become effective in 2012.\u201d Not exactly a thrilling level of tax, legal and regulatory clarity for an entity already being viewed with suspicion from traditional partners. https://github.com/otoco-io/otoco-wiki Wiki on Series LLC ",
