The current landscape of protocols, DAOs, and protocol governance is extremely nascent. While MakerDAO has been on the bleeding edge of debt management, stablecoins, and governance there is still much to improve. Our team is comprised of heavy defi users, regular governance participants, and core community members of various protocols. While our predominant experience has been in Compound and Uniswap, we are excited to expand our efforts further into MakerDAO. We look forward to applying our learnings from other protocols to MakerDAO and build cross-protocol relationships. GFX Labs isn\u2019t a fund. We don\u2019t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi. Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance. We promise to be active participants. We\u2019ll explain not only when we agree, but most importantly, when we disagree. As first-hand participants in governance know how frustrating it is to work on a proposal, receive limited comments, only to have the proposal shot down at launch. Our door will always be open to those who share the passion for DeFi that we have. Conflicts of Interest GFX Labs may from time to time be engaged as a delegate on other protocols. All governance participation is public and done through the same wallet. GFX Labs has read and agrees to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct. ",

These parameters would raise Maker\u2019s maximum debt ceiling (DC) to 50 million DAI from 10 million DAI, and increase the amount debt can be increased in a single transaction from 10 million to 25 million. This poll also is to lower the targeted borrow rate on Aave for DAI from 4% to 3.9%, as a precaution to increase liquidity for withdrawals should borrowing increase substantially. Recommendation: Vote yes. Over time, it may be preferable to target an amount of DAI and not a rate, but it is fairly small and currently borrow rates for DAI on Aave are at 5.4%. Increase the wstETH-A Debt Ceiling (closes Thursday) Summary Increase debt ceiling to 50 million DAI from 5 million DAI for Lido\u2019s staked ETH. Recommendation: Vote yes. This ilk has high demand and the first 5 million filled up quickly. While staked ETH bears more risk than ETH, it also generates substantially higher fees (currently 4% vs 2.5% on ETH-A). 50 million is also a good cap before extra due diligence and risk assessment, as mentioned above. Recognised Delegate Compensation Increase (closes Thursday) Summary: Increase the maximum annual compensation parameter from 48k to 144k DAI for the current 3-month trial period of paying delegates. Recommendation: Vote yes. Delegation requires compensation to provide the time and effort required to make informed votes. NS-DROP Covenant Modification (closes Thursday) Summary: This would alter the (informal) covenants of Maker\u2019s only real-world borrower of any size. New Silver finances fix-and-flip loans, and this financing is done through the Tinlake platform at Centrifuge. These parameters would allow New Silver to increase the amount of the DROP tokens used as collateral to Maker from 75% of the total pool to 85% as long as New Silver has at least 50% of the junior tranche (TIN tokens). Recommendation: Vote no. New Silver has a current debt ceiling of 20m DAI and currently uses about 10m of that. GFX Labs generally does not think their request is unreasonable, but Maker entered into the current cohort of Centrifuge deals without any legal review, and subsequent review highlighted areas that needed improvement. It seems wise to limit any additional exposure (in total or by adjusting risk parameters) to any asset from the Tinlake platform until the legal structure is upgraded. Our understanding is that this is still in progress. GUNIV3DAIUSDC-A Parameter Adjustments (closes Thursday) Summary: This raises the DC for Gelato UNI DAI-USDC LP tokens from 50 million to 500 million DAI. Also decreases the liquidation ratio from 105% to 102%, and stability fee from 1% to 50 bps. Recommendation: Vote yes. These changes are all part of viewing this collateral type as safe and performing as expected. These LP tokens should in theory act similarly to the USDC PSM (Peg Stability Module) with regards to steadying the DAI <> USD peg, though not in real time. They have the added benefit of generating ongoing fees, though, and put at least some of the USDC blacklisting risk at arm\u2019s length over at Uniswap. Add WBTC-B as a new Vault Type (closes Thursday) Summary: This creates a WBTC-B ilk similar to the ETH-B ilk. It is intended to target more risk-seeking borrowers, and all parameters are listed through the link (there are a lot, since it\u2019s a new ilk). The important ones are a stability fee of 5%, liquidation ratio of 130%, DC of 500 million DAI. Recommendation: Vote yes. This is a copy of the ETH-B ilk (vault type), except with a lower debt ceiling (DC). The ETH-B ilk has performed well under all major stress periods this year, and liquidations are robust under the 2.0 system. Note that when they perform as expected, Maker receives a 13% liquidation fee on top of debt being repaid, so there is substantial buffer in even extreme conditions before the debt itself can go bad. 2 Polls Closing Next Monday: Community Greenlight Poll - OHM (Olympus DAO) (closes Monday) Summary: This vote is merely to gauge sentiment. The margin of Yes/No in theory is supposed to influence how high of a priority a given collateral is to onboard given limited developer resources. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. In practice, it is not clear that these polls alter the order in which collaterals are onboarded. Unless there\u2019s a compelling reason, voting Abstain is probably the easiest move on any \u201cgreenlight\u201d poll \u2013 it doesn\u2019t onboard a collateral and there has not yet been any kind of risk assessment at the time of polling. Community Greenlight Poll - MDI (MD Irradiance LLC) (closes Monday Nov 15 at 11 am Eastern) Summary: This is a real-world company specializing in late-stage solar project finance. It is headed by one of the Real World Finance (RWF) Core Unit\u2019s contributors, Christian Petersen. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. See previous. ",

                    "content": "GFX Labs Recommendations: 8 Polls Closing Monday Nov 22: Ratification Poll for Adding the Deco Fixed Rate Core Unit (DECO-001) Summary: This would add a new core unit (CU) that would integrate the Deco Protocol with Maker. An in-depth explanation of the proposal and ensuing community discussion can be found here. The gist is that when a vault is used to generate DAI, the final repayment of that debt can be thought of as Principal + Interest. Deco splits those two obligations into a zero-coupon tokenized obligation for the principal and a yield token for the stability fees (interest). Maker can and does adjust rates, so all Maker vaults are effectively overnight lending that people roll over by default unless they become undercollateralized. Deco allows for an effective fixed rate by selling the user back their yield token (which represents the variable-rate interest they will pay until time X) for a fixed price up front. This provides their vault with an effective fixed rate until the yield token matures at time X. A possible secondary use case is that these yield tokens or zero-coupon principal repayment tokens can be sold or traded on the secondary market, allowing for hedging, speculation, etc. Recommendation: Vote no. This is a really novel product for crypto and has a lot of applications. That said, the price tag is quite high. The Deco CU would be paid a floor of 1.8m DAI. There is also an MKR vesting component of 1500 MKR over three years for the core unit. After Maker had recouped those expenses of DAI and market price of MKR, Deco CU would then get a 15% revenue share of further sales of the yield token. Given the unclear demand for fixed-rate crypto financing, this would be a fairly expensive experiment where even if it paid off, 15% of all profits would go to the Deco CU. Regardless of outcome, the Deco CU would also receive 1500 MKR (market value $4.7m at the time of writing). The run rate can be roughly estimated at $3.36m, assuming no price appreciation in MKR over three years. This operation of separating the principal and interest is also well known in traditional finance. Unfortunately, this means this could be interpreted by aggressive regulators as a security, and its issuance to the public or being unencumbered on secondary markets could attract unwanted attention. Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1) Summary MakerDAO currently uses a single one-size-fits-all collateral application template for interested parties to propose new collaterals for the Maker protocol to accept. This template has not been updated in some time, and also was created before real-world assets (RWA) were a focus for Maker growth. This proposal provides a RWA-specific set of questions that are more relevant to non-crypto native collaterals. These changes are mostly related to legal structure, funds flow, jurisdictions, and other housekeeping that is more necessary for RWA financing. It also asks more relevant questions about risks, mitigations for those risks, risk monitoring, and the applicant\u2019s compliance program (among other things). Recommendation: Vote yes. These changes were proposed by a project finance attorney who has been a part-time contributor to the Real World Finance (RWF) CU. The questions are certainly an improvement over more technology-focused ones that are more relevant to crypto collaterals. Even if this template turns out to be insufficient, it can be easily iterated upon. Ratification Poll for Immunefi Security Core Unit (IS-001) Summary: This proposed CU would include 1 MakerDAO contributor + Immunefi (a private company) to manage bug bounty program, opsec, and emergency response. This appears to be mainly a combination of a passive bug bounty, ongoing risk assessments throughout MakerDAO CUs\u2019 technical infrastructure, and on-call security services. Total annual cost is around 489k DAI + 21.92 MKR ($68,620 at time of writing) for a total estimate of around $557k assuming no appreciation/depreciation in MKR price. Recommendation: Vote no, but with the strong recommendation to resubmit based on the recommendation below. It is not entirely clear that this is strictly an area not owned already by the Protocol Engineering (PE) CU, but the price tag is relatively small and anything offloaded from PE is generally good, as their time is expensive and their resources are often the bottleneck to getting new features shipped and new collaterals onboarded. However, there is a strong need to move away from CU-based MKR vesting and to a contributor-based MKR vesting. As will be discussed further down in the budget polls, there is a tendency for CUs to be overly optimistic about their ability to fill vacant positions. While this is fairly easy to correct in cash/DAI budgets, it is harder to correct for MKR vesting when done for an entire CU. The current practice is to \u201cstream\u201d MKR to a CU\u2019s multisig, which can be called by that multisig once vested. The practical outcome of this is that unfilled positions are accruing MKR, and the Maker protocol will require facilitators to bear the burden of accurate record-keeping and returning all excess MKR. As positions are not filled or vacated all at once, this also means churn will make it difficult to calculate the actual MKR due to be delivered to a CU. GFX recommends that MKR vesting plans that are approved on the basis of headcount & salary also be tracked at the protocol level individually. If the CU as an entity is requesting vesting based on a formula other than headcount/individual compensation, then accruing at the CU level may be appropriate. Real-World Finance Core Unit MKR Compensation, RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP38)  Summary: This proposal is to establish MKR vesting for contributors of the RWF CU. It is for an annualized total of 560 MKR for 7 full-time equivalents (FTE). As of writing, that is a market price of $248k/person/year in MKR. Recommendation: Vote no, with a strong recommendation to resubmit. See the above argument about avoiding MKR vesting to the CU rather than to individual contributors. Modify Core Unit Budget RWF-001 (MIP40c3-SP39) Summary: This is a continuation of the previous RWF CU budget of 1.86m DAI annually. No increase has been requested from the 2021 budget. Recommendation: Vote yes. The RWF CU is currently under budget due to being unable to meet their target of 7 FTE contributors. Should budget surpluses continue for this CU, then that can be addressed in the future. Modify Core Unit Budget COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP40) Summary: This is a slight increase over the prior budget (from annualized 486k DAI to annualized 515k DAI) for the GovComms CU. Most of the change is due to an increased travel budget to events attended by MakerDAO contributors. Recommendation: Vote no, with a strong recommendation to resubmit. The GovComms CU, like many, has overbudgeted consistently (or come in under budget consistently). This is usually due to fully funded, but unfilled positions. The proposed budget seems reasonable, but there is a substantial cash surplus already on the books for this CU. At time of writing it has 30k DAI that has not yet been claimed from its previous budget in addition to any off-chain cash assets. October expenses are not yet available to the public, but August and September had large (~40k DAI) combined surplus, so there is presumably a healthy cash position off chain. As part of an effort to harmonize CU budgets with actual outlays, GFX Labs recommends this budget be resubmitted in the following governance cycle, as it appears to have more than a month of surplus cash. There is also a 121k DAI emergency fund that can be tapped in the event of budget shortfalls between now and a resubmitted budget. Modify Core Unit Budget MKT-001 (MIP40c3-SP33) Summary: This is proposed 6-month budget for around 425k DAI (annualized 850k) for the Content CU. Recommendation: Vote yes. Under the PaperImperium/Field Technologies flag, this budget was voted down in the previous month due to a large surplus accumulated from overbudgeting. It has some minor changes, but most importantly the unfunded month allowed for Maker to effectively claw back some of that surplus. As stated elsewhere, there is a need to offer this and other CUs which regularly overbudget some assistance in how to forecast budgets. In particular, there needs to be more attention paid to fully funded positions that never get filled in budgets. Ratification Poll for Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit (SAS-001) Summary: This is a proposed CU to maintain and monitor the auction services (such as for liquidations and MKR burning). The annualized proposed budget is 1.13m DAI + 243.79 MKR ($755k in market price at time of writing) for an estimated annualized expense of $1.88m assuming no MKR appreciation. There is also a 245k one-time seeding of an emergency fund. Notably, the MKR vesting is retroactive to June 21st, when this core unit was first incubated within the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES) CU. Recommendation: Vote no, with a strong recommendation to resubmit. The price tag is high, but technical staff never come cheaply. The mission of monitoring the keeper ecosystem is definitely important, as is a dedicated unit to bring auctions to L2s. A number of initiatives are already proposed for this CU to begin work on, including unifying auction UIs, extending auction functionality with features such as notifications and Twitter bots. The roadmap and work to date looks good. The main impetus for the vote no is identical to the reasoning laid out above in other recommendations that MKR vesting that is justified by headcount/salary should be tracked individually on chain. Retroactive MKR vesting should probably be avoided when possible. It is better than losing productive members, but is not ideal. Please take notice. ",

                    "content": " 9 (1 Updated, 7 New) Polls:  Closing Nov 17: UPDATE: Modify Core Unit Budget COM-001 (MIP40c3-SP40) Summary: GFX Labs had recommended a vote No on this due to the core unit consistently coming in under budget and presumably having ample cash reserves.Today, the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling CU was providing standardized synopses of budgets throughout the DAO. GovComms\u2019 facilitator has now posted (correctly) that due to an error their stream of DAI from the protocol was misconfigured, and the GovComms CU has been accruing approximately 10,000 DAI/month less  than budgeted for. Recommendation: Vote yes. The reasoning for recommending No previously was to allow excess cash to burn off. Due to a technical error, this core unit has accrued 30,000 DAI less than expected over the prior few months. This leaves their current stream on schedule to accrue around 46,000 DAI by Dec 31st. The GovComms monthly budget is currently 40,500. Cash stockpiles within the core unit should be within acceptable ranges given that it has received less funding than budgeted. That this occurred for months and was only caught now by another core unit does reinforce the need for standardized reporting by core units, and access to basic accounting resources on the part of facilitators who may need assistance in budget forecasting. Local Liquidation Limit Adjustments for ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WBTC-A, and wstETH-A Summary: This would increase the local liquidation limit (ilk.hole) parameter in the following manner:ETH-A from 40m DAI to 65m DAIETH-B from 25m DAI to 30m DAIETH-C from 30m DAI to 35m DAIWBTC-A from 25m DAI to 40m DAIwstETH-A from 3m DAI to 7m DAI This parameter sets the maximum lot size of a given collateral that can be simultaneously auctioned for liquidation. Recommendation: Vote yes. This is designed to shorten liquidation settlement time, and is recommended by the Risk Core Unit. That lowers tail risk of being unable to liquidate safely because prices fall faster than auction throughput. Rates Proposal \u2013 Nov. 15, 2021 Summary: This would increase WBTC-A stability fees from a rate of 2.5% to 4.0%, and fees for the as-yet-unimplemented WBTC-B ilk from 5.0% to 7.0% (WBTC-B will offer more leveraged exposure similar to ETH-B). Recommendation: Vote yes. The on-chain liquidity of WBTC <> DAI is less than half that of ETH <> DAI. MakerDAO is also the largest holder of WBTC collateral as of writing, and has slower liquidation procedures than major lending platforms, suggesting that liquidity could be exhausted to the point of major slippage if significant amounts of WBTC have to be auctioned off. The increased riskiness suggests it deserves a higher risk premium than ETH. Offboard AAVE-A Vault Type Summary: Encourage offboarding of AAVE-A with the following parameter changes:  Increase AAVE-A liquidation ratio linearly over 30 days such that all vaults are liquidated by the end of 30 days. Lower AAVE-A debt ceiling to 0 DAI. Lower AAVE-A liquidation penalty to 0%.  Recommendation: Vote abstain. This vault type is not profitable. It has only 18 active vaults and a total outstanding DAI debt of less than 1.2m DAI. Estimated revenue is less than 12,000 DAI per year. Oracles are roughly estimated to cost $200,000/year. There may, however, be strategic reasons to maintain such a vault, making the value of off boarding unclear and an informed decision difficult. Offboard BAL-A Vault Type Summary: Encourage offboarding of BAL-A with the following parameter changes:  Increase BAL-A liquidation ratio linearly over 30 days such that all vaults are liquidated by the end of 30 days. Lower BAL-A debt ceiling to 0 DAI. Lower BAL-A liquidation penalty to 0%.  Recommendation: Vote abstain. This vault type is not profitable. It has only 3 active vaults and a total outstanding DAI debt of less than 172,000 DAI. Estimated revenue is less than 2,000 DAI per year. Oracles are roughly estimated to cost $200,000/year. There may, however, be strategic reasons to maintain such a vault, making the value of off boarding unclear and an informed decision difficult. Offboard COMP-A Vault Type Summary: Encourage offboarding of COMP-A with the following parameter changes:  Increase COMP-A liquidation ratio linearly over 30 days such that all vaults are liquidated by the end of 30 days. Lower COMP-A debt ceiling to 0 DAI. Lower COMP-A liquidation penalty to 0%.  Recommendation: Vote abstain. This vault type is not profitable. It has only 4 active vaults and a total outstanding DAI debt of less than 504,000 DAI. Estimated revenue is  just over 5,000 DAI per year. Oracles are roughly estimated to cost $200,000/year. There may, however, be strategic reasons to maintain such a vault, making the value of off boarding unclear and an informed decision difficult. Change of Covenants for P1-DROP (Peoples Company Series 1) Summary: This is a Centrifuge asset related to the purchase of farmland that was approved in the spring, but with an initial debt ceiling of 0 DAI, as the applicant was not yet ready to accept financing. The requested change of covenants: expand the geographical limits to a total of 9 states (Arkansas is the newly included state) and increase the maximum acquisition price from $1.5m to $2.85m for a single underlying asset. Recommendation: Vote no. This was one of the Centrifuge assets that was approved prior to obtaining a legal review. Maker is still awaiting completed upgrades to the initial legal structure. The lack of clarity whether the actual farmland (asset under management) is actually collateralizing the tokens \u2014 rather than simply revenues derived from them \u2014 is not particularly reassuring. Even under a fully enforced liquidation scenario, the borrower would have up to 5 years to liquidate underlying assets. Considering that the 2% proposed Stability Fee is fairly low, the likely unsecured nature of the tokens used as collateral, and the duration risk for Maker, GFX Labs (as a new governance participant who has not previously weighed in on the original deal) recommends a vote against.  2 Polls Closing November 29:  Greenlight Poll for SolidBlock Red Frog Digital Coin (SB-frOGI) Summary: This is a proposal to onboard as collateral the frOGI coin, which represents an interest in Red Frog Digital Series LLC. The LLC will fund the development of Red Frog Beach Island Resort & Spat, to be owned by Blue Sea Holdings LLC (parent company appears to be Panamanian). Recommendation: Vote abstain. As discussed elsewhere, these polls do not seem to have an impact on actual prioritization, except in the event of a No vote. No risk assessment has yet been done and no significant discussion has occurred, so it is also difficult to make an informed decision. Greenlight Poll for Monetalis Wholesale SME Green Growth Lending (MONETALIS) Summary: This is a proposal to onboard as collateral Monetalis as a real-world asset. They are requesting a line of 400m DAI against senior secured credit as collateral. Monetalis plans to deploy the funds to finance green economic initiatives in the UK.  Recommendation: Vote abstain. As discussed elsewhere, these polls do not seem to have an impact on actual prioritization, except in the event of a No vote. No risk assessment has yet been done and no significant discussion has occurred, so it is also difficult to make an informed decision. ",

This Medium article says that GFX Labs is a blockchain products company with products such as minecraft on the blockchain and a DeFi credit card.  A third point mentions that they\u2019d like to be involved in governance of various crypto protocols, including MakerDAO.  What was the motivation for PaperImperium to switch from Field Technologies (which was a one-man company) to GFX Labs?      GFXlabs:  GFX Labs isn\u2019t a fund. We don\u2019t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi. Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance.     Why does the company, as an entity, want to be involved in governance across different protocols? Why do you expect such involvement to be profitable, despite holding no crypto positions? While I appreciate the love for DeFi and team building, a startup has venture capitalists and ultimately, a bottom line, to answer to so I\u2019d like to hear about the company\u2019s motivations and vision.   Is anyone aside from PaperImperium going to be involved in the voting decisions for Maker? If yes, who are they, what backgrounds do they have?   What amount of time per week do PaperImperium and others who may be involved expect to spend on Maker related work vis a vis other governance and product activities you do?   Since GFX Labs will be/already is involved in governance of many other DeFi protocols, how do you plan to address the conflicts of interest you have declared? Note that this has already started to occur with the offboarding of various COMP and UNI vaults.   Thanks for answering and welcome (back!) to delegation  ",

                    "content": "4 New Polls (closing Nov 25): Add GUSD Peg Stability Module  Summary: This would create a new Peg Stability Module (PSM) similar to the current PSM-USDC and PSM-USDP. The initial parameters would be: Toll in (tin): 0% Toll out (tout): 0% Debt Ceiling (line): 100m DAI Target Available Debt (gap): 10m DAI (this is how much it can increase at a time until the max DC (line) is hit) Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl): 24 hours (this is how long before DC is raised by another gap) Recommendation: Vote yes. Tyler Winklevoss proposed this in October. Gemini has a good reputation generally, and from a risk standpoint GUSD looks very similar to USDP. GUSD is smaller market cap, and thus experiences a bit more price volatility, so this is likely to help GUSD\u2019s peg but be immaterial to Maker\u2019s. However, Gemini is a useful business partner to have a relationship with, and the additional risk seems low. Most importantly, Gemini will integrate support for the PSM through their own product lines, offering a way for users on Gemini to directly mint DAI through USD>GUSD>DAI. This is similar to what Paxos has done, and provides an on/off ramp from fiat to DAI and vice versa. The more of those \u2013 and at arm\u2019s length so KYC is the responsibility of the integrator \u2013 the better. Increase the System Surplus Buffer  Summary: This is an instant runoff poll with the following options. Voters are allowed to rank their preferences: \uf0b7 Option 1: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 90 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million DAI per week. \uf0b7 Option 2: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 130 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 0.67 million DAI per week. \uf0b7 Option 3: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 90 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 1 million DAI per week. \uf0b7 Option 4: Increase the System Surplus Buffer from 60 million DAI to 130 million DAI, with a gradual increase of 1 million DAI per week. \uf0b7 Option 5: No change to the System Surplus Buffer. Recommendation: Vote Option 4 for First Priority, Option 2 for Second Priority, Option 4 for Third Priority, Option 1 for Fourth Priority. MakerDAO is still largely in a growth phase. However, as Maker increasingly embarks upon risky policies with regards to its peg management (D3M) and regulatory scrutiny (Deco Protocol), having ample reserves to insure against both bad debt and inability to pay (rapidly growing) salaries seems prudent. DAI supply is rapidly expanding, and a 130m DAI surplus today would still be just over 1% reserves that are earmarked for both self insurance and operating expenses. All options should continue to see Maker regularly burn MKR, which should ensure a healthy keeper ecosystem. The first two options would result in slightly more burning a week, which should not affect MKR price, but does materially slow the accumulation of surplus buffer. Note that even at 1m DAI/week, it would take 70 weeks (around 1 and 1/3 years) to reach 130m Surplus Buffer. Add WBTC-C as a New Vault Type Summary: This would create a new vault type (ilk) for WBTC with the following initial parameters: Stability Fee: 1.5% Liquidation Ratio: 175% Debt Ceiling (line): 1 billion DAI Target Available Debt (gap): 100 million DAI Ceiling Increase Cooldown (ttl): 8 hours Debt Floor (dust): 7500 DAI For the various liquidation auction parameters, see the poll.  Recommendation: Vote yes. Now that Maker is the main source of WBTC lending on Ethereum, new ilks for this underlying collateral can help to segment users based on risk tolerance and also potentially spread out liquidation timing. Two weeks ago, GFX Labs voted yes on WBTC-B, which is now live and provides exposure for users more risk tolerant than WBTC-A would allow. WBTC-C provides lower rates for those users who manage their position more conservatively. For reference, WBTC-A has a LR of 145% and 4% fees, and WBTC-B has a LR of 130% and 7% fees. Increase the Aave D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling  Summary: This would increase the maximum debt exposure from 50m to 100m DAI. Recommendation: Vote yes. This has been successful to date, and allows Maker to generate higher revenue that most of its vaults would generate. As an unintended consequence, Maker is also beginning to accrue stkAAVE. While there are serious concerns about using this module to target a rate and not an amount of DAI, the 100 million DAI maximum exposure is unlikely to pose a risk to the USD <> DAI fixed exchange rate.

It includes onboarding WBTC-C, some parameter changes, and core unit budget distributions. 7 Polls Ending Thursday, Dec 2 Increase the Dust Parameter for Most Vault Types Summary: This would increase the Dust parameter for all vault types excluding ETH-B, ETH-C, and PSM facilities. Dust would be increased from 10,000 DAI to 15,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote yes. Dust is the \u201cdebt floor\u201d parameter. The main justification to raise this is to ensure that liquidations are still worthwhile in an environment where gas costs continue to escalate. If large amounts of bad debt accumulate in small denominations, that debt would need to be either written off or increase the subsidy parameter (Chip and Tip parameters) in order to entice at least one bid. Increase the Dust Parameter for ETH-B Vault Type Summary: This would increase the Dust parameter for ETH-B vault type from 30,000 DAI to 40,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote yes. See the above recommendation. ETH-B offers riskier levels of leverage, so it is particularly important that small lots of collateral not accumulate as bad debt, or present a potential attack vector. Use the MakerDAO Treasury to Fund MKR Expenses  Summary: Future and currently vesting MKR expenses will be paid from the treasury (currently the wallet known as Pause Proxy) rather than being minted. Recommendation: Vote yes. While the treasury MKR is effectively as good as nonexistent while it is out of circulation, it seems prudent to use MKR that already exists on-chain rather than issue new MKR. In the event that MKR is in the future considered a security under US laws, this at least prevents Maker from issuing new securities. This seems like a prudent move, made out of an abundance of caution. Add GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A as a New Vault Type Summary: Include a new vault type, which supports the Gelato token for UNI DAI-USDC LP tokens in the 1 bps pool. Initial parameters would include: Stability fee: 1% Liquidation ratio: 105% Max debt ceiling (line): 10,000,000 DAI Recommendation: Vote yes. The highly popular DAI-USDC pool enabled at Uniswap (after a proposal by a GFX Labs member) has attracted enough liquidity that the associated Gelato token is likely to scale to a size worth onboarding as a new vault type. One Time Payment to the GovComms CU to Deal with Budget Issues Summary: Make a one-time payment of 27,058.33 DAI to COM-001 (GovComms CU) to correct a misconfigured budget streamed during Q3 2021. Recommendation: Vote abstain. This CU just had a ~6% budget increase approved recently. That this discrepancy was not discovered until the close of the previous quarter suggests that these funds were not needed to meet the budget needs of that quarter. Parameter Changes Proposal- MakerDAO Open Market Committee Summary: The MOMC (MakerDAO Open Market Committee) has suggested the following parameter changes: -Increase ETH-A fees from 2.5% to 2.75% -Increase ETH-B fees from 6.0% to 6.5% -Increase LINK-A fees from 1.5% to 2.5% -Increase MANA-A fees from 3% to 6% -Increase UNI-A fees from 1% to 3% -Increase GUSD-A fees from 0% to 1% -Increase UNIV2DAIETH-A fees from 1.5% to 2.0% -Increase UNIV2WBTCETH-A fees from 2.5% to 3.0% -Increase UNIV2USDCETH-A fees from 2.0% to 2.5% -Increase UNIV2UNIETH-A fees from 2% to 4% -Decrease GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A fees from 0.5% to 0.1% -Increase WBTC-A max debt (line) from 1.5b DAI to 2b DAI -Increase WBTC-A available debt (gap) from 60m DAI to 80m DAI Recommendation: Vote yes. These mostly reflect fee increases to reflect increased borrowing demand in the market generally for ETH and LINK. The increase for GUSD is to begin encouraging unwinding of the small GUSD ilk in preparation for a GUSD PSM. The remaining increases are an attempt to make those smaller vault types able to cover estimated oracle expenses. The decrease in the Gelato UNI vault type is an attempt to retain users as liquidity continues to migrate to the 1 bps pool on Uniswap. Add CurveLP-stETH-ETH as a New Vault Type Summary: Adds new vault type for Curve LP stETH-ETH. The initial parameters can be found in the proposal, with the most important ones being: Stability Fee: 4.5% Liquidation Ratio: 155% Maximum Debt Ceiling (line): 5m DAI Recommendation: Vote yes. While not without some underlying risk due to the exposure to Curve smart contracts, Maker has determined it wants to support the growth of and use as collateral of staked ETH. This is another way to offer this to users. ",

These include a slew of parameter changes, onboarding a new vault, and distribution of DAI to recognized delegates (GFX Labs compensation will be rolled to next month out of respect for gas costs to the protocol) 2 Polls Closing Thursday Dec 9: Adjust wstETH-A System Parameters  Summary: Adjust parameters for the wstETH-A ilk. Notable changes are to increase maximum debt (line) from 50,000,000 to 200,000,000 DAI, and the available debt (gap) from 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote yes. The staked ETH (Lido) collateral type has proved to be popular and a growing source of revenue. As staked ETH becomes more liquid on secondary markets, this collateral promises to be a source of much-needed growth for Maker. Though staked ETH is more risky than ETH itself, it does accrue much higher fees. Adjust MATIC-A System Parameters  Summary: Increase maximum debt (line) from 20,000,000 to 35,000,000 DAI. Decrease available debt (gap) from 20,000,0000 to 10,000,000. Recommendation: Vote yes. This collateral was onboarded as part of a deal with Polygon to utilize their treasury. Raising the maximum debt ceiling will allow them to get closer to the targeted DAI debt, while lowering the amount that can be minted in a single transaction reduces risk in volatile markets \u2013 most MATIC liquidity is not on Ethereum, limiting liquidation throughput. 2 Polls Closing Monday Dec 20: Greenlight Poll: aUST (Anchor TerraUSD)  Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote abstain. As mentioned previously, greenlight polls do not appear to in practice affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded. Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. Greenlight Poll: G-UNIv3-DAIUSDP (Gelato Uniswap V3 DAI-USDP LP Token) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote abstain. As mentioned previously, greenlight polls do not appear to in practice affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded. Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. ",

DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Debt Ceiling Targeting  Summary: This proposal from the Maker Open Market Committee is to target a percentage of the DAI (excluding DAI used for recursive or looping leverage) on Aave V2. Options are 25%, 30%, or neither indicated percentage. Recommendation: Vote 25% of natural DAI supply. Some discussion can be found here, though it is not well developed. D3M would most safely be managed by referring to the utilization of the various PSMs. However, targeting a share of supply on Aave V2 as the limiting variable seems more conservative than targeting a borrow interest rate alone. Details of how to regularly monitor non-recursive/looping DAI supply would be appreciated, but this policy seems less likely on the surface to negatively affect the USD <> DAI peg. Note that looping for liquidity mining rewards adds to net supply, so 25% of natural supply would be less than 25% of total supply. DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Net Rates Spread Summary: This targets a net spread between Maker ETH-A vault type and borrow rates on Aave (inclusive of rewards). The proposal is specifically for a 50 bps spread with Maker vaults cheaper than Aave V2. Recommendation: Vote No. This increases both liquidity and credit risk exposure to Aave. Given current rewards and ETH-A rates, this implies targeting 3.75% borrow rate on Aave. This is below the current 3.9% borrow rate targeted on Aave. Manually or automatically, Maker runs the risk of negatively impacting its peg should reserves be drained by overheating the DAI borrow market with artificially suppressed rates. D3M should be used in a manner that is either market neutral, or with a built-in kill switch when PSM reserves fall below a given amount. Until Maker has policies in place to avoid copying hundreds of years of history of government currency mismanagement, actively pushing borrow rates artificially downward is imprudent. Recognized Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier Summary: This would create a linear modifier to DAI compensation for Recognized Delegates that have a minimum of 75% participation. This would slightly reduce earnings for delegates with performance metrics between 90% and 99%, and make eligible for partial earnings those delegates with metrics between 75% and 90%. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This seems a fair iteration on delegate pay, and should foster a healthier delegate ecosystem. ",

                    "content": "5 Polls Ending Jan 13 Prioritize Onboarding a Compound DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) Summary: This would signal to the various core units that a Compound D3M should be prioritized. Recommendation: Vote Yes. @GFXlabs proposed this, and supports it for reasons outlined in the original Signal Request \u2013 the most important points being that it treats Compound and Aave on par with each other, diversifies exposure for Maker, and generates material amounts of revenue. Raise the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) Threshold Summary: This would raise the required MKR from 75k to 100k in order to allow permissionless activation of emergency shutdown. Recommendation: Vote Yes. @GFXlabs proposed this, and supports it for reasons outlined in the original Signal Request \u2013 the most important point being that it would place the shutdown threshold beyond what a single MKR holder can activate. Prioritize DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) for Maple Finance Summary: This would signal to the various core units that a Maple Finance D3M should be prioritized. Recommendation: Vote No. The proposal is to create a pool of DAI that would then be managed by a Pool Delegate to provide unsecured or undercollateralized loans. In its current form, this sounds a lot like creating a portfolio manager rather than lending against specific collateral. There also is minimal junior tranche and no co-investors. The combination of small or no junior tranche/co-investors and unsecured/undercollateralized loans is a large increase in risk. That a Pool Delegate would oversee the DAI investments without direct voting by MakerDAO is a third way in which this would be \u201cdeep space\u201d for Maker, and GFX recommends the applicants return with a way to remove some of these novel aspects, or reapply using the traditional MIP6 process for these borrowers. Increase the Dust Parameter for Select LP Token Vaults Summary: Increase the dust parameter from 15,000 to 60,000 DAI for UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2USDCETH-A, and UNIV2BTWCDAI-A. Increase the dust parameter from 15,000 to 25,000 DAI for UNIV2WBTCETH-A and UNIV2UNIETH-A. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This adjustment is meant to account for the gas costs when liquidating LP tokens, which were not considered under current dust limits. Dust is the minimum permitted debt for a vault. Recover DAI Locked in Optimism Escrow Summary: Assist a user by recovering 10 million DAI from Optimism Escrow. Recommendation: Vote No. Maker should find a way to assist users who perform this and other correctable user errors. There should, however, be a uniform policy in place. This user within hours had highly connected individuals within MakerDAO lobbying for the return of 10 million DAI, while Maker has never assisted small users who have performed similar \u201ccopy/paste errors\u201d like sending tokens to the DAI contract. GFX believes Maker should assist this user, but under a policy that would provide recourse to other users who do not have the benefit of connections or large sums of money to catch attention on the forum. Where possible that process should be permissionless, and probably involve a fee for retrieval \u2013 Compound, for example, charges 10% as a means of discouraging users from treating it as a risk without cost. 16 Polls Ending Jan 24 Community Greenlight Poll \u2013 OGN (Origin Protocol) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. As mentioned previously, greenlight polls do not appear to in practice affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded. Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. Community Greenlight Poll \u2013 OUSD (Origin Protocol) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. As mentioned previously, greenlight polls do not appear to in practice affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded. Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. Community Greenlight Poll \u2013 RBLD (Robinland Holdings) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote Abstain.

Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. Community Greenlight Poll \u2013 TUSD-PSM (TrueUSD) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. As mentioned previously, greenlight polls do not appear to in practice affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded. Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. Community Greenlight Poll \u2013 USDap (BondAppetit) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. As mentioned previously, greenlight polls do not appear to in practice affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded. Additionally, at this stage, there is often de minimus information available, and no due diligence or risk assessments have been performed. Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) Summary: This requests 8,771,477.05 DAI. The breakdown is as follows: Oracle Gas Costs (1/1/22-3/31/22): 3,932,547.84 Oracle Emergency Fund: 1,805,407.21 Maker Foundation Refund (~8/1/21-12/31/21): 3,033,522 Recommendation: Vote Abstain. The costs for ongoing and future oracle gas costs should be in a separate proposal from a 3 million DAI transfer to the Maker Foundation, which requires more discussion. It is not clear why a nonprofit foundation that existed to bootstrap MakerDAO is now sending a bill for 3 million DAI. That being said, this 3 million DAI is bundled together with a \u201cmust pass\u201d proposal. We prefer to pick our battles, and while this is disappointing, this is not a hill we plan to die upon. Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001) Summary: This would onboard the proposed Tech-Ops CU. The annualized budget requested is just around 2.5m DAI (NB: There is a discrepancy in the proposal where not all numbers were updated to a slight decrease in budget, and this does not appear to be reflected in the poll; the discrepancy is just under 80k DAI). MKR per full time contributor is budgeted at 75.68 per year. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The budget is a bit high, but after sharing that view, the proposed facilitator was able to find a way to lower the budget. It still seems expensive on the MKR side, but the personnel have performed good work to date and were willing to compromise. That\u2019s a solid combination. Onboarding Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) Summary: This would onboard the proposed Strategic Finance CU. Its mission would primarily be a dual mandate to provide and improve financial reporting within the DAO, and allocate capital to improve efficiency. The annualized budget requested is approximately 990k DAI. MKR per full time contributor is budgeted at 80 per year. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The facilitator and other staff are members from the Real World Finance (RWF) CU, and are experienced and knowledgeable about MakerDAO\u2019s internal workings. The facilitator, @Aes, has been a driving force for greater internal cost controls and financial oversight. The other prong of the SF mandate that is capital efficiency is also supported by GFX \u2013 which has two proposals that are in part to address that lack of efficiency. Aes and @SebVentures will be addressing a largely unmet need for the DAO. MIP62: Collateral Offboarding Process Summary: Provide a standard procedure for notifying users of collateral offboarding. Recommendation: Vote Yes. GFX made this proposal, and collaborated with members from GovAlpha, CES, and GovComms in drafting it. This will likely need further updates, but will support @collateral-core-unit in their mission to have a \u201clifecycle\u201d approach to collateral management. Modify Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 Summary: This is a budget for the StarkNet CU to pursue its Phase II of deliverables. The total budget is 974,583 DAI, of which StarkNet will cover half. The total request is for 487,292 DAI. Recomendation: Vote Yes. The StarkNet CU is inexpensive, and a way to continue pursuing L2 solutions beyond what Protocol Engineering CU can output. Hedging in as many directions at once as possible is prudent, and the continued cost sharing with StarkNet is appropriate and makes the expenses quite manageable. This tranche of deliverables include L2>L1 fast withdrawals and L2<>L2 teleportation with Maker Wormhole, adding to network effects of the former including Arbitrum and Optimism. MIP64: Ratification Poll for Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure Summary: Proposed by the Immunefi Security CU, this is establishes a bug bounty program managed by that core unit. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is necessary for the Immunefi CU to fulfill its mandate, and Immunefi has become one of the leaders in Web3 bug bounty management. MIP63: Maker Keeper Network Summary: This is a series of contracts to interface with third-party keepers in the MakerDAO ecosystem. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Supporting and otherwise encouraging functional and participating keepers in the various auction formats is important. While the keeper ecosystem is sufficient at the moment, any technical assistance to maintain the health of that ecosystem is critical to the overall health of the Maker protocol. Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) Summary: This is a proposal to reduce budget to 0 DAI and offboard the facilitator for Content CU. Recommendation: Vote No. While some improvements could be made in quality and quantity of deliverables, there is no replacement for this core unit available. Maker has no marketing core unit, and cannot afford to also have the Content CU go dark. There would be even less communication with external stakeholders and the public. Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 Summary: This proposal onboards Will Remor as RWF-001 facilitator. RWF CU currently has no facilitator after @SebVentures stepped down following a related proposal by @rune to offboard him. @williamr is the replacement to prevent the CU from being without a facilitator. Recommendation: Vote Yes. RWF needs a facilitator. Will has shown himself to be qualified and involved in RWF. The only concern is that Will has also been approved to work for Aave in a similar role \u2013 real world asset risk assessments. It would be useful to get some clarification from Will if he will work for a competing protocol as well as head the Maker RWF CU. GFX would support a commensurate increase in Will\u2019s pay to ensure Maker has exclusive access to his services with regard to real world assets in DeFi. Modify Core Unit Budget, DUX-001 Summary: This proposal is primarily to improve the process of funds flows, disbursements, technical implementation, and standardization. Recommendation: Vote Yes. These changes seem appropriate, and automating a stream of payments to a CU wallet is better than lump sum payments from a standpoint of DAO control. Modify Core Unit Budget, SES-001 Summary: This proposal is a similar set of changes as that proposed to the implementation of the DUX-001 budget. It is primarily around technical details and improved internal control, automation, and disclosure. Recommendation: Vote Yes. More automation and adjustments to implementation will improve the oversight of governance. ",

                    "content": "Thanks GFX for the thoughtful points. I\u2019ve set out some points to address them and give context on how we think the Maple proposal benefits MakerDAO in scaling DAI issuance and diversifying the base of assets. One of the core value props is the addition of corporate loans to the asset base supporting DAI issuance. This sounds a lot like creating a portfolio manager rather than lending against specific collateral.  This is lending against corporate receivables and future cash flows. This is a new vertical asset type for Maker which diversifies its entry into the real world lending space. It currently supports small-to-med business lending through Centrifuge and institutional lending is a natural adjacency.  Small or no junior tranche/co-investors  Maple can include credit enhancement via the staked reserve. This is a junior tranche of MPL and USDC which is held in reserve to provide a buffer against defaults. The appropriate level size of this reserve can be part of commercial discussions. It receives a portion of the interest yield to incentivize it so we expect reasonable appetite.  Unsecured/undercollateralized loans  Loans are undercollateralized because we have found that this offering is required to attract the most creditworthy borrowers in the space. The concern highlighted is with credit risk. Expected credit losses are a combination of the Probability of Default and the Loss Given Default. Maple addresses this at the probability of default level by targeting large institutional borrowers where the Delegate 1) thoroughly due diligences borrower financials and 2) Borrowers execute a Master Loan Agreement which gives the legal right to enforce (this would not need to be conducted by Maker, there is a Cayman Foundation set up which would perform this). The other mitigation here is sizing. Maker\u2019s allocation to undercollateralized loans would start as a small portion of the overall DAI portfolio.  Pool Delegate would oversee the DAI investments without direct voting by MakerDAO is a third way in which this would be \u201cdeep space\u201d for Maker  Key concern identified is the ability of the Delegate to deviate in its underwriting. The counter here is that it is not scalable for MakerDAO to underwrite every loan and hence in any basket approach, where Maker is funding a pool of loans, there would need to be underwriting delegation of sorts. The outcome that needs to be solved is avoiding deterioration or drift in credit underwriting. This could best be accomplished through sharing the Delegate\u2019s credit policy and review of portfolio performance on a regular (quarterly) basis to give MakerDAO comfort that standards are maintained.

Detailed discussion of each point can be found up-thread from here. 2 Polls Closing Jan 20 Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal would enact the following parameter changes: -Decrease ETH-A stability fee from 2.75% to 2.50% -Decrease wstETH-A stability fee from 4.00% to 3.00% -Decrease Gelato UNI V3 DAI/USDC (0.01%) stability fee from 1.00% to 0.50%f -Decrease maximum debt ceiling of LINK-A from 140m to 100m DAI -Decrease maximum debt ceiling of YFI-A from 130m to 50m DAI -Decrease maximum debt ceiling of UNI-A from 50m to 25m DAI -Decrease UNI V2 UNI/ETH maximum debt ceiling from 20m to 5m DAI -Decrease GUSD-A debt ceiling from 5m to 0 DAI -Decrease AAVE D3M target borrow rate from 3.9% to 3.75% Recommendation: Vote Yes. The ETH stability fee decreases are in line with market conditions \u2013 the Peg Stability Modules have been filling up quickly, reflecting lower demand for vault leverage than demand for DAI. These small decreases will also help protect Maker\u2019s market share of ETH as a collateral in DeFi markets. The decrease in the Gelato DAI/USDC is also appropriate, as that collateral can serve as a small substitute for some PSM inflows. The debt ceiling decreases are appropriate given the lower liquidity recently for those collaterals, which increases risk of slippage in liquidation. The decrease of the GUSD-A debt ceiling is appropriate as a first step towards transitioning GUSD exposure to the new (and as yet unused) GUSD-PSM. The decrease in targeted borrow rate is appropriate given the parallel reduction in ETH-A stability fees. In the future, we would still like to see something other than rate targets as the metric by which D3M exposure is managed. Decrease Gelato UNI V3 DAI/USDC (0.01%) Liquidation Ratio Summary: This proposal would lower the liquidation ratio of this collateral from 105% to 102%. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Given the underlying stable-stable pairing, and the need for the Gelato LPs to serve as alternatives to the USDC PSM, this seems appropriate. Note that liquidations have been and will continue to be disabled for this collateral type. ",

At the margin, these lower rates may increase DAI borrowing. It would be nice to give this committee a grant or mandate to estimate borrower sensitivity to rates, though. Decreasing the TUSD fee is part of the offboarding housekeeping that will need to occur if fully offboarded. The D3M target rate is simply following the ETH-A rate decrease, having originally been pegged arbitrarily to the kink in the Aave borrowing curve. The rebalancing of the two G-UNI vault types makes sense given the migration to the 1 bps pool. ",

                    "content": "3 Polls Ending Feb 3 Extend the Delegate Compensation Trial Summary: This proposal would extend the delegate compensation trial up to a maximum of 6 months (through July 2022). Recommendation: Vote Yes. Pay is needed to both compensate delegates for time spent on governance activities and to entice new delegates into the ecosystem. Until MIP61 (or another delegate compensation MIP) can be approved, this extension is required to provide pay to Recognized Delegates. Offloading TUSD-A Summary: Rank the following options in order of preference -Activate liquidations on TUSD-A, which will liquidate undercollateralized vaults -No action -Create new TUSD-PSM that only accepts outflows of TUSD for DAI Recommendation: Vote (in order of preference) to activate liquidations, abstain, no action. Creating a new PSM simply to offload what little TUSD is still in the system (around $26 million worth) is not a good use of engineering time. Allowing any eligible vaults to be liquidated would clear it all out eventually (the stability fee is 1% and no new collateral can be added). Given that this legacy vault type is of manageable size, it is unnecessary to spend scarce resources on offboarding it. Turning on liquidations is easy, though GFX would expect to see the MIP62 Collateral Offboarding Process followed to offer users of Maker\u2019s software to adjust their positions. Introduce Rate Limiting to Flap Auctions Summary: This proposal would authorize Protocol Engineering to alter the Flapper Contract to add parameters that can limit the number of DAI-for-MKR auctions that can occur simultaneously. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Several weeks ago, around 400 auctions were run in parallel, resulting in substantial numbers of below-market bids, including several auctions where the winner bid effectively 0 MKR for 30,000 DAI. This was a known exploit, but had not been prioritized to fix. While the auction format needs to be upgraded, this is a low-effort way to fix the exploit. ",

Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is a @GFXlabs proposal. As articulated in the signal request, this is to increase diversification amongst redeemable, regulated stablecoins while not increasing exposure beyond that which can be covered by the Stability Buffer. 8 Polls Ending Feb 28 Facilitator Onboarding (DUX-001): 0xDeniz Summary: This proposal would onboard 0xDeniz as a facilitator to the DUX Core Unit. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is a planned succession within the Core Unit. @bainpm is stepping down to a less managerial role, and @0xdeniz is the candidate being put forward to lead the Core Unit. Modify Core Unit Budget (RISK-001) Summary: This proposal would modify the Risk Core Unit budget from a monthly spend rate of 182,000 DAI/month to 230,000 DAI/month. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The budget increase is largely driven by an expanding headcount and expansion of services provided to include more data analytics. An example of this is bringing @Makerburn within the Risk CU to ensure funding for the makerburn website. Modify Core Unit Budget (CES-001) Summary: This proposal would generally continue the previous budget of Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit, while also adding approximately 250k DAI to the Core Unit\u2019s auditor wallet to maintain a 3-month runway. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This budget is generally in-line with the previous one, with only minor increases in overall payment from MakerDAO. MIP4c2-SP16: MIP 55 Amendments Summary: This proposal would amend MIP 55. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The changes are mostly housekeeping, with correction of typos in MIP55c1 and MIP 55c2, and increasing clarity in MIP55c3 around reduced oversight burden needed for Special Purpose Fund proposals at or below 50,000 DAI in expense. Modify Core Unit Budget (IS-001) Summary: This proposal would modify the Immunifi Security Core Unit by an increase of 69,000 DAI quarterly with an initial lump sum sent to the Core Unit\u2019s auditor\u2019s wallet of 138,000. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This increase in budget is to include operational audit MIP63c4-SP1: Onboard/Amend Keeper Network - TechOps Summary: This proposal would formally put the TechOps Core Unit\u2019s operations of keeper infrastructure within the new MIP63 (Keeper Network) framework. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is largely an internal formality, and does not require additional budget or work that is not already being performed. Onboarding Maker Talent (MT-001) Core Unit Summary: This proposal would onboard the Maker Talent Core Unit with an annualized budget of 746,831 DAI and MKR vesting of 12.97/FTE. Recommendation: Vote Yes. There is a need to staff several CUs that are struggling. If this CU does not demonstrate an ability to source successful candidates for positions after several quarters, it can be offboarded. MIP60: Intangible Asset Assignment Summary: This proposal provides a process for managing intangible assets such as social media platforms on behalf of the DAO. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Currently there is no formal structure, which has historically served to block some CUs from access to certain assets, or has simply created confusion around who controls some assets. ",

This would result in @MakerMan receiving 8245 DAI. No other delegates would be affected. Recommendation: Vote Yes. MakerMan initially missed payment in November due to falling just under an \u201call or nothing\u201d threshold of participation. Recognizing this as a problem, governance has shifted to a compensation model that now proportionately lowers payment rather than a cliff to 0. Notably, MakerMan\u2019s lowered activity level in November was a function of family health events, which highlights why the compensation model was shifted to be more flexible. 1 Poll Ending March 7 Greenlight Poll: PUNK (NTFX CryptoPunk) Summary: Signal support or opposition for onboarding this token as collateral. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. As mentioned in other votes, greenlight polls do not appear in practice to affect the speed or order that collateral is onboarded.

The increase in capacity for staked ETH provides more room for one of the few avenues of growth for the protocol. Similar reasoning can be applied for the Aave direct deposit module. As the use of D3Ms increases, however, Maker needs to come to terms with a more sustainable policy for managing them, as the protocol is a price taker, not a price maker, and artificially suppressing interest rates on the market could have negative effects upon the DAI <> USD peg. Adding Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions Summary: This proposal would add a new parameter (lid) to the surplus (flap) auctions. It would initially be set at 150,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The surplus auctions need upgrading to a new format, but in the meantime, this is a low-effort fix for the problems seen when $60m in ETH was liquidated, resulting in several million DAI of surplus auctions triggered in parallel. This parameter will prevent that from occurring in the future, and the initial level would limit parallel auctions to no more than 5 at a time. @GFXlabs supported the current executive spell, which included our own proposal to raise the debt ceiling on GUSD-PSM, and a small retroactive compensation to @MakerMan ",

These include, among other things, setting the liquidation penalty to 0 and incentivizing keepers to kick the auctions. Recommendation: Vote Yes. All but two small vaults are already eligible for liquidation, should they be re-enabled. TUSD-A is a vestigial vault that has not allowed new users for quite some time, so this is the on-chain portion of the offboarding process, which should be coupled with off-chain components to make users aware who may wish to avoid liquidation. Reinstate Surplus Buffer Lerp Summary: This proposal would lower the ceiling to the Surplus Buffer from 250 million DAI to 60 million DAI. This ceiling would increase in a linear fashion to 90 million DAI over the next 30 weeks. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This would return to the currently adopted MKR burning policy after emergency responses were made to the \u201cFlappy Friday\u201d event that resulted in very inefficient surplus auctions. Any permanent changes to this policy should be run through governance processes. GFX Labs supported the out-of-sequence executive spell, which addressed a possible exploit in how flash loans and the Emergency Shutdown Module interact. ",

This program historically (under the Foundation) focused on translations and materials for non-English speakers.

                    "content": "9 Polls Closing March 28 Declaration of Intent \u2013 Invest in Short-Term Bonds Summary: This MIP13 declaration of intent would signal that MakerDAO has an official policy of pursuing investment in short-term bonds with a portion of its stablecoin reserves. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Details will be important for any implementation, but as would be assumed from GFX\u2019s prior proposals to onboard short-term Treasury bills and notes, this is important for risk management, and should provide revenue as well. Facilitators Offboarding: SHOP-001 Summary: This proposal would offboard both of the facilitators of the MakerDAO Shop Core Unit. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Both facilitators have indicated a willingness to step down and that they are unlikely to be able to give the Shop CU the attention to execute. Onboard Gelato to the Keeper Network Summary: This proposal would add Gelato to the MIP63 Keeper Network. That includes 1,000 DAI/day budget, with min and max buffers of 4,000 and 20,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Gas costs are low currently, but keeping activities often require gas in times of network congestion. Keeper network allows Maker to subsidize these costs to ensure a robust keeper network exists. In this case, it is for 1,000 DAI/day, and with a small buffer that will not exceed 20,000 DAI. The costs are small, and a healthy keeper network is vital to the security of the Maker protocol. Onboard Keep3r to the Keeper Network Summary: This proposal would add Keep3r to the MIP63 Keeper Network. No current subsidy is requested at this time. Recommendation: Vote Yes. See the previous poll to onboard Gelato. Keep3r does not currently require a subsidy while they operate pro bono, but are anticipated to need one in the future. Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties Summary: This proposal would add 115,000 DAI/month to the Immunefi Core Unit\u2019s budget, so that small bug bounties could be paid without delay through the CU\u2019s operational wallet rather than waiting on executive spells. Recommendation: Vote No. There isn\u2019t a demonstrated need for an additional 1,380,000 DAI annually to process small bug bounty payouts quickly. This proposal does not specify what \u201csmall\u201d is in terms of payment, and the CU\u2019s operational wallet currently holds excess DAI, with another quarter million DAI available in the auditor\u2019s wallet. Also, a request for two small payments took only 9 days from request on the forum to payment. In short, there just doesn\u2019t seem a reason to 1) increase the effective budget for the core unit at this time, 2) bypass the existing process. If a bug bounty hunter has earned a small payout and would experience hardship in waiting for a week or more, then the Immunefi CU should make that payment and request reimbursement from governance. MIP61: Recognized Delegate Compensation Summary: This proposal would establish a formula for monthly compensation to Recognized Delegates. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This proposal has been a long time in coming to a vote, and while most proposals can benefit from iteration, this is a clear improvement over no compensation for delegates or a continuation of emergency compensation measures. Modify Core Unit Budget (GOV-001) Summary: This proposal would fund the GovAlpha Core Unit for another 12 months. The monthly stream would increase by 250 DAI/month to 89,983 DAI/month. There is also a one-time allocation of 30,000 to increase the continuity fund (for contingencies) to 180,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. It\u2019s a rare budget at MakerDAO that doesn\u2019t request large increases. That this budget continues the old one with de minimis changes sets an example for other core units. The only notable increase is to add to the core unit\u2019s contingency fund. Modify Core Unit MKR Budget (GOV-001) Summary: This proposal would provide a MKR vesting plan for GovAlpha contributors. This would be approximately 67 MKR/year per full-time equivalent. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The requested MKR is among the lowest, and GovAlpha provides mission-critical services to the DAO. It also has the distinction of being the only CU with a track record of returning excess funding, having done so twice. This reputation for conservative budgets deserves, if anything, slightly more MKR or DAI than has been requested in this governance cycle. Modify Core Unit Budget (RWF-001) Summary: This proposal would increase the existing Real-World Finance Core Unit budget from a monthly spend of 155,000 DAI to 685,000 DAI, as well as formalize some improvements to the flow of funds to the CU from the DAO. It would include a one-time transfer of 2,055,000 DAI to the contingency fund due to the increased overall rate of budgeted expense. Recommendation: Vote No. This is an ambitious budget proposal, which would increase the monthly spend by more than 300%. The bulk of the expenditure is earmarked for anticipated legal costs associated with onboarding new real-world asset originators. RWF CU would become, under this proposal, the largest core unit by cash expenditure, eclipsing even Protocol Engineering. The nature of the request \u2013 funds specifically to perform legal due diligence on counterparties \u2013 is a good one. But this is a serious amount of money being requested, and so a serious weighing of risks and benefits is required. The main risk appears to be simply that there is not a demonstrated history of demand to support half a million DAI in expenses on legal each month. In theory, unused funds would be returned to the DAO. This is, however, a song that many core units sing, and unused funds get rolled over because ever-increasing budgets require ever-larger contingency funds. This very budget proposal is an example of that. Despite a slight surplus at the moment, no funds will be returned, because a larger budget requires a larger reserve. Until a history of core units returning excess capital to the DAO materializes, we feel it is best to reverse this tradition of assuming unspent funds will be returned. Even if funds are indeed returned, those funds could have been deployed elsewhere. After a sleepy autumn and winter, MakerDAO is beginning to ponder aggressive growth strategies that require every penny of reserves to backstop that growth and keep the protocol sound. Given rumblings of doing a capital raise through debt or token issuance, any excess DAI that is overbudgeted could incur costs to replenish in the Surplus Buffer. Finally, for a request of this size \u2013 effectively going from second gear to top speed \u2013 it seems prudent to ensure there is an ability for the underlying deals to close and the assets to deliver cash flow. Even if every DAI is spent exactly as imagined, there is still little clarity on how long it will take to recoup a profit on this investment. We encourage the Real-World Finance CU to return with a more modest budget request. It is simply unclear at this time whether this money can be spent as envisioned, and if that spend would create value for the protocol. After several deals have been closed, a budget request of this size would be more appropriate. Until then, scope a budget that is for the next quarter, and we can all revisit whether the pipeline is maturing as hoped. ",

Note that the margin of Yes vs No will affect the prioritization score for this proposal vs other approved collateral proposals. Recommendation: Vote Yes, but GFX will Abstain. This is GFX Labs\u2019 proposal, so we fully support it. This provides a low-risk \u201cbolt on\u201d opportunity for meaningful revenues, while also strategically expanding Maker\u2019s monetary policy control into the front end of the fixed-rate curve for DAI. Due to a disclosed conflict of interest, we have pledged not to vote at the on-chain poll stage. MIP62 Amendments Summary: This proposal would amend MIP62 (Collateral Offboarding) to remove references to the Content Core Unit, which is no longer active. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is housekeeping to maintain an up-to-date MIP62. ETHAmsterdam Event Special Purpose Fund Summary: This proposal would allocate 50,000 DAI for a MakerDAO event in Amsterdam during an industry conference scheduled between April 20-24, 2022. Recommendation: Vote No. There has been no stated business purpose for the event this is requested for. It is modeled on an event that occurred at ETH Denver and paid for by various core units, but that event appears not to have provided any clear benefit despite enormous spend. That there is no plan to even track who attends, harvest their information, or mine it for potential business partners or job talent is striking. Additionally, 30,000 DAI has apparently already been taken from the budgets of four core units for a deposit on the venue for this event, implying that if this 50,000 DAI is not approved, the DAO will lose the money deposited. This 30,000 DAI was sourced from multiple core units, including two technical core units whose mandates do not seem consistent with the funding of social events with no clear business purpose. There is simply no reason to rush a spend of at least 80,000 DAI on an event with no clear purpose or payoff. Maker already suffers from a reputation of core units spending too much money \u2013 let\u2019s not add weight to that notion. If this event has clear value it can deliver, then there will be no shortage of future industry conferences to host one. At the moment, this appears to be an unnecessary expense at a time Maker is actively discussing raising capital. Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge Summary: This proposal would establish an initial limit of 5,000,000 DAI for the StarkNet simple bridge. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This initial limit is in line with MakerDAO\u2019s standard practices with regards to risk exposure with new assets and technical implementaions. ",

This is a difficult basket of proposals to approve. For the most part, they are correctly reacting to market conditions and Maker\u2019s need to halt losses in market share. The committee is making sensible recommendations. On the other hand, this is projected to lower revenues by approximately 6 million DAI. Note that MakerDAO is already operating at a more than 10 million DAI loss in the absence of large liquidation fees. Given governance\u2019s tendency to approve nearly all spending proposals while rejecting revenue-generating proposals, the loss of revenue will be felt. A wider discussion about fiscal discipline is necessary in the face of market headwinds. GFX hopes that delegates who share this concern (such as @MakerMan, @JustinCase, and @Doo_StableLab, among others) and the @strat-fin-core-unit are open to collaborating to build a series of specific proposals to reduce expenditures where they would be felt the least, freeing up funds to allocate towards efforts that will be accretive to protocol income. Launch Maker Wormhole With Optimism & Arbitrum Domains Summary: This proposal would deploy the Maker Wormhole, with initial support for the Optimism and Arbitrum chains. Initially, each domain would have a maximum of 1m DAI exposure and 0 fees for users to make fast withdrawals. Recommendation: Vote Yes. MakerDAO and the Maker protocol have both lagged DeFi peers such as Aave and Uniswap in launching a multichain strategy. Initiating the \u201ctest level\u201d of support for an official, safe, trusted method of DAI transfer is a massive positive. As more domains are added and confidence grows enough to increase exposure to the Wormhole, this ",

Note that no announcements of changes are required under this amendment, and presumably have no boundaries on what could qualify (or not) for a bounty or how quickly those boundaries could shift.

                    "content": "12 Polls Ending April 25 Governance Communications Mandate Refresh (COM-001) Summary: This proposal would reword, clarify, and slightly expand the mandate of GovComms CU. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Changes are reasonable and mainly serve to clarify the existing role of the core unit. Dissolution of Content Production, MKT-001, Multi-Sig Summary: This proposal would remove the multi-sig for Content Production CU (MKT-001) from the list of recognized multi-sigs of the DAO. The multi-sig currently has no funds but does have a small unclaimed funding stream of 3,800 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. There is, of course, a chance this proposal will be front run to claim the remaining funds before this multi-sig can be wound down. But the funds are not large and this is a housekeeping measure. GFX Labs would support the explicit delegating of this process in the future, when front-running may carry a cost and to reduce burden on governance. Attn: @GovAlpha-Core-Unit Adding CES-001 as a Collateral Onboarding Domain Team Summary: This proposal would onboard the entire Collateral Engineering Services CU as a domain team under MIP7. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This largely formalizes CES CU\u2019s position within vestigial MakerDAO \u201claw\u201d under MIP7 and MIP8, and also potentially interacting under MIP9. GFX Labs would support further cleanup of these three MIPs, should @GovAlpha-Core-Unit and/or @collateral-core-unit wish to take up the task. Modify Collateral Application Form Summary: This proposal would update the collateral application form (used primarily for MIP6 applications). Recommendation: Vote Yes. Most of these updates originate in past experiences and a desire to standardize information format and disclosure. The first step to a fair process is a standardized process. Pairwyse Licensure (MIP66) Summary: This proposal would license the Pairwyse protocol IP for MakerDAO in exchange for 4,000 MKR and 15% of vault fee revenue transacted through Pairwyse. Recommendation: Vote No. This is simply too expensive for what it offers. The underlying technology looks innovative and may find market fit. However, Maker is already straining under cost of developing an in-house fixed rates solution with nearly identical costs. It seems an imprudent use of funds to pay for licensure of Pairwyse when the utilization of D3Ms for fixed-rate protocols like Element and Notional can be done for a fraction of the price, development of the already-approved Term Lending Module, or utilization of the already-approved Maple D3M and proposed TrueFi D3M could provide MakerDAO with the same exposure without the legal liability or expense. Methodology and Review Process for Structured Finance Transactions (MIP67) Summary: This proposal would formalize a process for the onboarding of structured finance transactions. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is an improvement over the current process. It does not, however, define what constitutes a structured finance transaction. To avoid overlapping mandates of too many core units in the first step of this process, we would like to see clarification as to what specifically constitutes a structured finance transaction. That being said, it is a clear improvement over the status quo, and has our support. Thank you, @Real-World-Finance @luca_pro @christiancdpetersen and others who authored this proposal. Modify Core Unit Budget: Protocol Engineering (PE-001) Summary: This proposal requests a 12-month budget of 7,590,000 DAI (632,500 DAI per month). Recommendation: Vote Yes. This represents a 24% increase over the prior year\u2019s budget, which is significant. Note that the previous year\u2019s budget was well executed and resulted in a 130,599 DAI surplus. Most of this increase is accounted for by increased salaries (PE proposes to fill new jobs within the core unit) \u2013 895,750 DAI. This represents increased investment in the engineering and development capacity of the protocol, and we support this. Other changes include increased travel budget and decreased contingency buffer and increased emergency funding to reflect the higher run rate of expenses. An effort was made to justify the increased head count in this post, and we find it a reasonable justification that this increased expense will result in greater capacity to develop, deploy, and maintain new products for the protocol. Modify Core Unit Budget: Data Insights (DIN-001) Summary: This proposal requests a 12-month budget of 1,083,000 DAI (90,250 DAI per month) and a MKR vesting plan of 330.48 MKR over 36 months (33.895 MKR per FTE annually). Recommendation: Vote No. This represents greater than 50% increase in the DIN CU operating budget, mainly driven by new hires to expand the scope of services provided by DIN to expand to L2s and RWA. We feel DIN provides a useful service, but mainly provides support to specific CUs. There is not a clear need for it to be its own CU \u2013 and feel similarly about other service CUs that appear to be vendors rather than core functions that need to be under governance supervision to secure the protocol. GFX would support a budget neutral restructuring to allow DIN to provide the same services it does now and for equivalent income, but without requiring the oversight of governance. That is to say, transitioning to a higher budget for those CUs that utilize DIN (and other vendor CU) services while unwinding DIN as a formal CU would be supported by GFX. If the CUs that act as the end users of DIN products request an increase to pay for expanded DIN services, we would also generally support that. This type of restructuring would 1) lower governance overhead, 2) grant CUs the autonomy to choose and manage relationships with vendors as they see fit. Modify Core Unit Budget: GovComms (COM-001) (Core Budget) Summary: This proposal requests a 6-month budget of 2,093,258 DAI. Recommendation: Vote No. On an annualized basis, this represents a 30% increase from the current 6-month budget. This expense is driven by 37,000 DAI in employer taxes that was not in the previous budget, as well as 72,000 DAI increase in operating expenses. There is also around 50,000 DAI increase in salaries and hourly compensation spread across 4 FTEs. GovComms has generally performed a satisfactory job at its current level of spend. It is unclear what additional operational efficiencies or cost savings for the DAO will be the reward for this increased spend. GFX recognizes that annual raises can be appropriate, particularly if contributors are advancing in seniority to reflect higher levels of skill. The overall 15% increase in compensation seems large. If this is due to seniority advancement as a result of increased skill and productivity, please note that, given the large increase. Of most concern are the large increases in employer taxes and operating expenses. How were these so small (8,000 DAI) in the current budget but a combined 110,000 in the new one? Were the funds from another category backfilling this expense? Or has the expense increased dramatically? The proposal does show that around 20,000 DAI of these expenses were previously covered in another line item, but that still leaves a lot of increased spend. We would like to see whether the current budget is actually insufficient or if the new budget reflects large spending increases in the employer taxes and operating expenses categories before voting yes on a new budget for this CU. This CU has ample emergency funds to cover any gap in funding between now and a future budget. Modify Core Unit Budget: GovComms (COM-001) (Budget Expansion) Summary: This proposal requests a 6-month budget of 2,643,678 DAI and would supercede the previous GovComms poll if approved. Recommendation: Vote No. This budget is the same as the previous one, but with an additional hire as a Public Relations Project Manager. There is no one filling this role in the DAO currently, but GovComms, with its focus on internal and stakeholder communications, should focus on its core competencies that it is already doing well, rather than attempt to fill this gap. For other reasons, see ones inherited from above. Add Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) Summary: This proposal would onboard the Events Core Unit, which would focus on planning, organizing, and executing MakerDAO-branded events. It requests a 12-month budget of 898,150 DAI and onboards 1 facilitator. Recommendation: Vote No. There has not been a clear argument made for how this spending either lowers costs, increases revenue, or improves products produced by the Maker protocol. The focus to date has been on large events at Ethereum conferences, with no commitment to even collect the contact information and names of those who attend. That provides poor optics at a time that there are active discussions of raising capital, MKR holders are denied the burner mechanism, and an assortment of other opportunities to deploy this capital are obvious. At the end of the day, this spend could be better deployed to PE, CES, Growth, or one of the (prospective or current) CUs associated with the RWA program, all of which have more obvious rewards for increased spend by improving the capacity of the protocol or the DAO to deliver, deploy, maintain, or integrate new products. We also refer to the opinions in the Data Insights budget request that this prospective CU appears to be a vendor. In the event that these services are argued to be worth the expense, we would prefer to see CUs who value those services fit the provision of those services into their budgets. Even when taken at face value, there is little reason for governance to have direct oversight of an Events CU, when that could fall under some combination of Growth, a future marketing CU, or even conceivably technical CUs (for hackathons) or GovComms/GovAlpha (for stakeholder exclusive events). Update Data Insights CU Mandate Summary: This proposal would modify the DIN CU mandate to include a focus on Layer 2, cross-chain, and RWA datasets. Exact text may be found in the link. Recommendation: Vote No. As stated with regards to DIN-001 budget request, we would support a budget-neutral unwinding of this CU to allow it to service CUs as customers without direct oversight or interference from governance. This would remove governance micromanagement of vendor selection (by pre-funding a CU for a given service), and DIN is part of an independent entity that is developing products for other counterparties and does not need either the boundaries of a mandate or the direct oversight of MakerDAO governance. As usual, GFX Labs supported the current executive, which is mostly concerned with various Oracles housekeeping tasks. ",

Greenlight Poll: Huntingdon Valley Bank Loan Syndication Summary: This poll asks whether the asset should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The terms suggested as a starting point are more sophisticated \u2013 a yield spread over a benchmark, for instance \u2013 and the counterparty a highly regulated US depository institution. Maker is in dire need of reliable counterparties with a willingness to scale and a track record of experience. HVBC\u2019s willingness to retain 50% of the loans they originate provides more alignment of any partner who has approached MakerDAO to date. Over time, HVBC intends to request lowering this retained portion, which may be appropriate if performance is as expected. If the relevant CUs can arrive at a legal structure that is both acceptable to HVBC and protects the DAO\u2019s most-senior debt position, then the economics of this partnership hold great promise for everyone involved. It is easy to imagine a strategic partnership where the DAO can contract with HVBC to originate loans fitting specific criteria. Even without any partnership beyond this proposal, the commercial mortgages and loans in this application are potentially material to the DAO\u2019s earnings and financial health. ",

Recommendation: Vote Yes. A portfolio approach to D3Ms (DAI Direct Deposit Modules) allows for risk diversification across counterparties and their underwriting practices. A positive result here would begin work on the technical implementation and clear the way for TrueFi to submit a particular pool management team for onboarding in the future. TrueFi likely brings access to markets where existing collateral options and D3Ms are not present, and can provide an accretive way to increase the use of DAI. Open Market Committee Rate Proposal Summary: This proposal would alter stability fees in the following manner: Decrease WBTC-A Stability Fee from 3.25% to 2.25% Decrease WBTC-B Stability Fee from 4.5% to 4.0% Recommendation: Vote Yes. Market share for Maker in the wrapped bitcoin markets overall, and this rate adjustment will end the risk premium of WBTC filtering through to the rate. At the end of the day, despite its name, Maker is a price taker on rates, and must follow market rates generally. The loss of revenue is not to be celebrated, but users of the protocol will find fewer attractive alternatives with this cut of WBTC rates back to the same levels as ETH. 2 Polls Closing May 16 Greenlight Poll: ATDC (ATD Combustors) Summary: This poll asks whether ATDC should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker protocol. The proposal can be viewed here. Recommendation: Vote No. This is an extensive proposal meant to appeal to Maker\u2019s \u201cClean Money\u201d initiative. Unfortunately, it is not necessary to evaluate the merits of this proposal due to the clear risk-reward mismatch. This proposal would create a credit line from the protocol for 5 years with a coupon of 2-2.5%. This is strictly worse than the risk-free rate, which at writing is 3.01% for US Treasury 5-year notes. Maker should not signal to the market that it is interested in any off-chain collateral that is lower yielding than the risk-free rate unless that collateral has similar credit risk as US Treasury debt obligations.

Recommendation: Vote Yes. GFX Labs proposed successfully a number of months ago to raise the ESM threshold from 75,000 MKR to 100,000 MKR. We also support raising it again. Ideally, ESM can be removed someday in the future. As the value guarded by the protocol grows, it is important to increase the resources required to shut it down. This would require more than 15% of all MKR to shut down the protocol permissionlessly. Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate Limited Flapper Summary: This proposal would adjust the lid parameter from 150,000 DAI to 30,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This parameter change would allow for only a single flap (DAI surplus) auction at a time, rather than five. That level of throughput may allow politically for the burner to be re-enabled, which may appease some vocal small MKR holder voices recently who have raised concerns that paid contributors have easy access to the protocol\u2019s revenues, while MKR holders themselves receive no benefit. Whether or not the flap auctions are the ideal mechanism for this, a controlled, constant burn would be a way to ensure that MKR holders \u2013 who ultimately bear the most risk backstopping the protocol as recent events with LUNA/UST have shown \u2013 receive some compensation, even if it is small and indirect.

                    "content": "5 Polls Ending May 23 Modify Core Unit Budget \u2013 Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Summary: This proposal is for 180,000 DAI/quarter + 50,000 DAI (one-time restocking) budget for the Strategic Happiness Core Unit. It would also include a 250 MKR vesting over 4 years with an 18-month cliff. Recommendation: Vote No. The initial budget for Strategic Happiness was small enough to be experimental. It is, unfortunately, not a good time for MakerDAO to commit more than three-quarters of a million DAI to swag distribution. Additionally, the MKR vesting is approximately what a member of the Oracles CU \u2013 a mission-critical core unit \u2013 would receive. A sharply reduced budget that was similar in scale to the previous budget would be supported, even if it included a small increase to offer some part-time compensation to the facilitator who has been working pro bono until now. Amendment to MIP40: Budget Process Summary: This proposal would amend the current budget process in a number of ways, including creating a regular budget cycle cadence, mandating return of unspent funds before any new ones are disbursed, and increased granularity in reporting actual expenditures. Recommendation: Vote Yes. While this will be an increased reporting burden on core units, these are largely quality-of-life improvements (synchronizing a \u201cbudget season\u201d) and needed oversight considering the sums of money being spent. In order to mitigate the increased burden, budgets that have 10% increase or less are exempted from some of the requirements. Budgets that would be >10% increase will also be required to have a continuity budget to accompany the requested increase so that the choice for MKR holders is not \u201cincrease funding or cut to 0.\u201d MIP69: L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals Summary: This proposal would deploy the first iteration of Maker Wormhole, which would allow DAI fast withdrawals from Arbitrum and Optimism to Ethereum. Recommendation: Vote Yes. While not without risks, the expansion of the Maker protocol to L2s and other chains is vital to allow more crypto-native growth. With such large market share on Ethereum, there are few routes to growth on-chain without this expansion. Later planned upgrades will include StarkNet, as well as L2-to-L2 teleportation of DAI. MIP68: Monetalis Lusitano, UK Green Economy SME Wholesale Lending Summary: This proposal would authorize the financing of a bond backed by a SME lending portfolio. Fees would be 2.00% annually + 80% profit sharing (as detailed within the proposal). The expected duration would be 10 years, but the bond would be puttable. The requested initial debt ceiling is 50,000,000 DAI, with an imbedded mechanism to increase to 100,000,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. At 105% collateralization, this collateral relies heavily upon appropriate marking. The precision required to properly mark the backing of this bond may prove difficult, particularly in a timely manner. A robust set of agreements in place to purchase liquidated or underperforming portions of the portfolio would be needed. While we have had no shortage of improvements we would like to see \u2013 and to some extent are beginning to see \u2013 from the RWF Core Unit, it makes us very uncomfortable to bypass the MIP6 process to onboard this proposal in a self-contained manner. In particular, this has prompted Monetalis to provide its own testimonials and assessments by individuals in the lending industry who feel they are credit worthy. Unfortunately, there appears to be potential for conflicts of interest. For instance, Mr. Abrahams formerly served as Head of Operations at Singer & Friedlander, which is now part of Shawbrook Bank. Mr. Ashworth formerly worked at Lombard. Shawbrook and Lombard are two lenders that would stand to sell most of the initial portfolio to Monetalis. These individuals may be very practiced in this field, but probably shouldn\u2019t serve as a substitute for RWF CU\u2019s evaluations. With regards to RWF concerns, we do note that Monetalis has recently announced it plans to onboard a partner to supply a junior tranche of financing. As for the proposed legal structures, the 6S Capital structure highlights how unforeseen expenses can have deleterious impact upon revenues remitted to the protocol. In that case, the fees accrued amount to less than the expenses of the real-world trust, meaning that less than the initial principal is apparently owed for repayment. Even if the legal vehicle performs exactly as anticipated, it is clear that an understanding of associated fees is needed up front. There has not been a clear statement that some form of currency hedging program will be implemented (since DAI are fixed to the dollar and Monetalis will be providing financing denominated in GBP). It would be prudent to have one in place, and one that can be sustained with the low yields projected for Monetalis. Overall, the proposal appears to have improved significantly from the original MIP6. However, the yield is quite low, realistically it requires a term commitment from Maker to avoid selling the portfolio prior to maturity, and the risk-reward just does not look favorable. It looks unlikely to be a disaster, but the money for the effort to implement and monitor simply isn\u2019t compelling. As a result, this is a difficult proposal to support. For now, we simply find it too difficult to evaluate the potential reward, and do not feel confident all of the risks are yet understood, and will be abstaining. MIP65: Monetalis Clydesdale, Liquid Bond Strategy & Execution Summary: This proposal would establish Monetalis as executor of up to 500,000,000 DAI in bond strategies. The intention is to swap to USDC to lower exposure to Circle. Recommendation: Vote Yes. In many regards this proposal addresses the same issues as GFX\u2019s own proposal to utilize US Treasury bills to lower direct exposure to USDC. This MIP reads as though there will still be further approval required for any strategies prior to deploying any DAI/USDC. Assuming the legal structure is considered sufficient by the various RWA core units/proposed core units, this should have fairly minimal execution risk on the part of Monetalis, and the 15 bps fee seems fair compensation for simply moving from DAI to dollars in a custodial account (or multiple, as Monetalis has stated a desire for multiple managers). The true risk comes from what bond strategies are ultimately approved. It is not clear that MakerDAO has the in-house expertise to wisely choose strategies. In particular, there should be special focus on both liquidity and preservation of capital, which will likely result in fairly low-yielding strategies. We strongly encourage the DAO to avoid looking at this MIP as a means of getting yield. Yield should materialize, but it is mainly a risk management move, to mitigate potential risk from such a concentrated counterparty. The mechanical implementation should not be difficult for Monetalis to execute, assuming it is given reasonable guidance by the DAO on bond strategy. Executive As usual, GFX Labs supported the current executive. It contained MKR vesting, fixed a minor bug in flash loans, and continued L2 technical work. ",

Recommendation: Vote Yes. Antalpha is an OTC and lending company. The origination fee of 1% and discount of 50 bps for ETH and WBTC vaults should encourage long-term use of DAI. The size is manageable, with 500,000,000 DAI limit requested each for the two collateral types. Yes, core units should perform preliminary work and present risk assessments for final approval. Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH Summary: This proposal would direct the relevant core units to investigate options for deploying a portion of the MakerDAO balance sheet into ETH. Recommendation: Vote No. Ether is a volatile asset. The Maker protocol is not especially well capitalized, so utilizing DAI from the stability buffer to purchase ETH provides a poor risk-reward without appropriate hedging strategies. Even more risky would be using the stablecoins in the PSMs to buy and hold/LP/stake ETH. Maker is already extremely exposed to the price of ETH through use of vaults. Should Maker choose to invest in crypto assets for income generation or asset appreciation reasons, it should solicit requests for proposal (RFP) from professionals with good track records. Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee Summary: This proposal would launch Maker Teleport (previously known as Maker Wormhole) with a 1 bp fee. Recommendation: Vote No. It is difficult to imagine a scenario where 1 bp would generate material fee, but it does provide friction to users. With no material revenue to be generated, focusing on the best possible user experience seems prudent. If volumes rise to such a point 1 bp becomes significant or demand is inelastic enough for a larger fee, then that can be revisited. At the least, this bridge serves as the only pegging mechanism for DAI between chains so that an Optimism DAI = Arbitrum DAI = Ethereum DAI. Just as we keep the PSMs friction free, so should the bridge until some other mechanism is available on each L2 to assist in maintaining a fixed exchange rate. As usual, GFX Labs supported the current executive, which vests MKR and raises the threshold to the ESM. ",

Recommendation: Vote Abstain. Normally, it would not seem like overcollateralizing FEI to mint DAI would be a large market. It\u2019s difficult to see a compelling use case beyond Tribe itself minting against its native token. If so, perhaps a specific deal should be negotiated with Growth to do an institutional vault for large amounts of Tribe\u2019s ETH collateral. The proposal as it stands seems difficult to evaluate without addressing the usage by Tribe, and whether that would account for oracle costs. Abstain. ",

This ilk has low usage that makes it a cost center after accounting for oracles budget. Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal would make the following changes: Reduce wstETH-A max debt (line) from 300,000,000 to 200,000,000 DAI Reduce AAVE D3M line from 300,000,000 to 100,000,000 DAI Reduce LINK-A line from 100,000,000 to 50,000,000 DAI Increase MANA-A line from 10,000,000 to 15,000,000 DAI Reduce AAVE D3M target borrow rate from 3.5% to 2.75% Increase wstETH-B line from 15,000,000 to 30,000,000 DAI Recommendation: Vote Yes. Dislocations in the Aave markets due to the end of liquidity incentivization makes the line reduction appropriate, and the target rate reduction should have only slight downward pressure on the market while increasing revenues. Increasing exposure to MANA is appropriate, given the high fees charged on that ilk, as well as it being one of the few areas of the Maker portfolio at all time highs. Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c7-SP2 \u2013 Modify Oracle Data Models Summary: This proposal updates the mix of sources utilized by the data model, with changes based on which venues have the most liquidity and volume. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Oracles CU has submitted this request in order to keep the oracles model using the most relevant price feeds. Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c19-SP1 \u2013 Update Oracle Expiration Time For All Oracles Summary: This proposal would raise the medianizer expiration time from ~4.3 hours to 24 hours. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Oracles CU has submitted this request after determining that timing expiration (rather than spread) is the main driver of oracle back end updates. This is expected to have significant gas savings. This does not affect updates based on spread. ",

Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is similar to the flap auctions, so is a good test case for DssKiln. Current market conditions are favorable for buying back MKR as well. Management of Velodrome Airdrop and veNFT Summary: This proposal authorizes a management framework for an expected airdrop of veVELO from the Velodrome protocol on Optimism. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This veVELO is an airdrop, and as a windfall asset that is also locked in Velodrome governance for the next 4 years, Maker may as well use it to its benefit. Add rETH Vault Type Summary: This proposal offers the following (among other) initial parameters and would authorize onboarding a vault type for rETH: Stability Fee: 2.25% Liquidation Ratio: 170% Dust: 15,000 DAI Maximum Debt Ceiling: 5,000,000 DAI Target Available Debt: 3,000,000 DAI Recommendation: Vote Yes.

                    "content": "11 Polls Ending June 27 Ratification Poll for Onboard Growth Task Force (MIP75c3-SP1) Summary: This proposal would onboard a Growth Task Force under MIP75 (unratified currently, but included in this cohort of polls). This Task Force would be provided 1,000,000 DAI and pursue objectives including (but not limited to) a capital raise, recruitment initiatives like hackathons, and positioning Maker as a credit wholesaler. Funds would be controlled on a discretionary basis by the 7 of 9 multisig included in the proposal. NB: This is a Ranked Choice poll with the following choices: Abstain Approve Task Force with delegated authority to spend funds Approve Task Force without delegated authority to spend funds Reject Task Force Recommendation: Vote Reject Task Force (primary and only choice). Leaving aside that MIP75 appears to have been proposed specifically to allow the Growth Task Force to exist, the scoped mandate for this task force is broad and meandering. Bundling hackathons to recruit technical talent with broadly unpopular ideas like a capital raise and undefined ways to support a multi-chain growth strategy is simply too much for one proposal. 1,000,000 DAI left to the discretion of 9 individuals without a defined, narrow goal presents significant risk of misallocation to the wrong implementation, or simply spreading the funds across too many priorities. Multiple members of the multisig also regularly express views on strategic direction that GFX simply does not agree with and does not want to see enacted because of poor risk-reward tradeoffs. The primary example is a desire to pursue a capital raise, which we are currently strongly opposed to in all forms until preceded by demonstrated need and improved spending discipline. For more general views on the proposed MIP75, please see the comments for that poll. Facilitator Onboarding to IS-001: @psychonaut Summary: This proposal would promote J. Pritkin (aka Psychonaut) to being a facilitator of the Immunefi Core Unit. He is currently a deputy facilitator. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. This appeared to be a fairly straightforward title bump + mandated actor privileges. However, a notable and respected member of the MakerDAO community recently posted a strong anti-recommendation. It is difficult to feel like we have an informed opinion at this stage. Facilitator Onboarding to DIN-001: @tadeo Summary: This proposal would promote Tadeo to being a facilitator of the Data Insights Core Unit. He is currently a full time contributor. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The outgoing facilitator has recommended Tadeo, who has also been the contact point for delegates and community members for a while. He is familiar with the core unit and has always been both willing and able to deliver needed data in our experience. Adding Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE-001) Summary: This proposal would onboard the Lending Oversight CU, with an annualized DAI budget of 984,000, a one-time seed transfer of 410,000 DAI, and an annualized MKR budget of ~63.5 MKR/full-time contributor on average. While not binding in this proposal set, SES CU has pledged to reduce its incubation program budget to offset the monthly budget of LOVE, if approved. Recommendation: Vote No. The mandate for this core unit seems unfocused in terms of deliverables. Perhaps the specific deliverables are difficult to articulate on a medium such as the forum, but it is not clear what milestones the CU would be measured against. Initiatives on its proposed roadmap include generalized frameworks, educational support to DAO members, and overall providing a \u201csecond set of eyes\u201d on structured finance deals that include MakerDAO. We recognize that an independent review of real-world asset deals is important, there are already Real World Finance, Collateral Engineering Services, and the incubated Legal & Transaction Services CUs involved in these projects. The most obvious role for LOVE would be to provide risk assessments, similar to Risk CU\u2019s relationship to Protocol Engineering CU when onboarding a crypto-native asset. The mandate as written \u2013 particularly the third initiative \u2013 suggests LOVE would perform more of an assessment of the assessments, presumably through a financial lens. The DAI price is material, but not extraordinary. But the MKR compensation is quite high, commanding levels of MKR that are akin to what a member of Oracles CU (which is mission critical) would receive. For senior staff, this would be even higher at ~111 MKR, which is considerably more than any other non-technical core unit. For reference, this amount would be between the MKR received by DECO and CES. Notably, the two full-time contributors already onboarded would receive this amount, so the 111 MKR/person/year seems the appropriate number to judge (rather than an average of 63.5 when fully staffed with two junior contributors). Perhaps it\u2019s appropriate, but it appears the 2 junior staff would get 16 MKR/year while the 2 already-hired senior staff would get 111 MKR/year. (Note that this does not include the repricing option, which the two staff would likely exercise given depressed market conditions) Overall, this is just an extraordinary amount of MKR for non-technical talent. MIP75: Task Forces Summary: This proposal would allow a framework or MakerDAO to formally recognize groups \u201cresponsible for coordinating high-level business decisions on behalf of the DAO. They may also work with an associated discretionary fund to realize business objectives.\u201d Recommendation: Vote No. This seems like a step backwards, by returning to specially empowered individuals and discretionary funds. The very nature of the proposal is to roll back oversight and remove \u201cstop, look, listen\u201d portions of public debate and input. This seems more like the early stages of a DAO that has not yet decentralized, and not appropriate for a DAO that has already made the transition away from special groups sharing private details with only \u201ctop delegates\u201d while actively excluding smaller delegates, MKR holders, and the Maker community overall. Adding Special Purpose Fund \u2013 Makershire Hathaway (MIP55c3-SP4) Summary: This proposal would authorize Strategic Finance CU (in collaboration with Risk CU and prospective LOVE CU) to pursue yield generation strategies and support DAI liquidity/utility. Funding would be 10,000,000 DAI Recommendation: Vote No. This mandate is too broad, and not under the direct supervision of governance. Given the relatively simple strategies being proposed \u2013 such as providing DEX liquidity for MKR and DAI pairs \u2013 there isn\u2019t an obvious reason to delegate 10,000,000 DAI to multisig. We are generally supportive of the more conservative, passive strategies and encourage Strategic Finance to bring proposals for lump-sum or D3M funding that are controlled directly by governance. MIP16 Amendments Summary: This proposal would alter the governance cycle to allow more time for technical work when implementing parameter changes. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Protocol Engineering has often expressed the view that the original spell-writing cadence was suboptimal. MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations Summary: This proposal would allow the DssKiln module to perform authorized open market operations. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The DssKiln seems to function similar to flap auctions. Making it modular to work with other tokens is a useful tool. Budget Ratification: Strategic Finance (SF-001) Summary: This proposal would allocate either a continuation of the existing SF CU budget (~990,000 DAI) or an expanded budget of ~1,300,000 DAI annualized. NB: This is a Ranked Choice poll with the following choices: Abstain Approve Increased Budget Approve Existing Budget Only Reject Budget Recommendation: Vote Existing Budget Only (first choice), Reject Budget (second choice). The expanded budget represents an increase of >30%. We don\u2019t feel there was a compelling argument made that the size of the increase would result in lower costs or higher revenues for MakerDAO. Onboard Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP4) Summary: This proposal would provide a monthly stipend with minimum 4,000 DAI and maximum 20,000 DAI to Keep3r Network, as described by MIP63. Recommendation: Vote Yes. A healthy keeper network is important for the safety of the protocol. This stipend defrays the gas and other minor operational expenses of a keeper. Budget Ratification: Growth (GRO-001) Summary: This proposal would allocate annually either a continuation of the existing Growth CU budget (~3,270,000 DAI) or a \u201cbear market\u201d expanded budget (~4,200,00 DAI) or \u201cbase growth\u201d expanded budget (~5,000,000). NB: This is a Ranked Choice poll with the following choices: Abstain Approve \u201cBase Growth\u201d Expansion Approve \u201cBear Market\u201d Expansion Approve Existing Budget Only \u201cBrandless Growth\u201d Reject Budget Recommendation: Vote Existing Budget Only (first choice), Reject Budget (second choice). Both budget expansions are significant, which is partly reflective of incubating a Brand CU. The Brand CU has expressed the view that Maker\u2019s product is vaults and leverage, rather than DAI. We simply disagree with this, as DAI is what sets the Maker protocol apart from Aave or Compound protocols. A branding effort focused on the currency rather than lending would be something we would be willing to reconsider in the future. Because we do not support the intended messaging of the incubating Brand CU, we do not support either of the expanded budgets. ",

The initial debt ceiling will be 100,000,000 DAI. Fees will be handled outside the vault level, and further details can be found in the proposal. Rates will be benchmarked off of SOFR. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is a major first step in partnering with a US depository institution, and should provide income that is uncorrelated with the movements of crypto assets. Maker Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal would alter rates and parameters on several vault types. The notable changes are below, with a complete list in the proposal. Increase GUNI V3 DAI-USDC (.05%) Stability Fee from 0% to 0.01% Increase UNI V2 DAI-USDC Stability Fee from 0% to 0.01% Increase wstETH-A Stability Fee from 2.25% to 2.50% Reduce USDC-A Stability Fee from 1% to 0% Reduce USDP-A Stability Fee from 1% to 0% Recommendation: Vote Yes. Raising some fees a modest amount is appropriate. Lowering the fees on vestigial stablecoin vault types will stop the current accrual of bad debt (which results in phantom DAI in the Surplus Buffer). Several debt ceiling lowerings were also included, mainly on LINK, YFI, MATIC, and wstETH. Select A Target Level Of rNPI Profitability To Guide Budget Cuts Summary: This proposal asks MKR holders for guidance on whether MakerDAO should aim to accumulate DAI in the Surplus Buffer, break even, or allow negative cash flow with a minimum of 3 years of runway). Recommendation: Vote Abstain. We have some marginal disagreements with how current financials are reported, and so do not feel it is appropriate to suggest a specific level profitability based upon them, particularly without knowing what budget cuts would be required to meet a specific goal. As usual, GFX Labs has supported the current executive, which includes delegate pay, Keep3r Network stream, and several million in core unit streams and direct transfers. ",

The relationship built with SocGen, proof of concept to the financial world, and diligence demonstrated in dotting every i and crossing every t have already proven useful. The amount is small by Maker\u2019s standards, and though the fees are only 5 bps and will not offset the legal expenses, it is a deal worth doing. 1 Poll Ending July 25 Governance Facilitator Onboarding GOV-001 Summary: This proposal would onboard Patrick_J as a facilitator of the GovAlpha Core Unit. The core unit currently has only one facilitator after LongForWisdom stepped back into a contributor-only role.

Reduce the WSTETH-A Stability Fee from 2.50% to 2.25%. Reduce the WSTETH-B Stability Fee from 0.75% to 0%. Reduce the WBTC-B Stability Fee from 4.00% to 3.75%. Increase the GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A Stability Fee from 0.01% to 0.02%. Increase the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Stability Fee from 0.05% to 0.06%. Increase the UNIV2DAIUSDC-A Stability Fee from 0.01% to 0.02%. Increase the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 1 billion DAI to 1.25 billion DAI. Increase the GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 750 million DAI to 1 billion DAI. Increase the MANA-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 15 million DAI to 17 million DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Unfortunately, the Maker protocol has struggled to convince users to generate DAI through vaults. It is not a good sign that in a rising-rate environment, Maker must cut rates yet again to retain users, but the outflows from stETH in particular and flat usage of ETH-B suggest a cut may be appropriate. Gradually raising rates on LP collaterals is also appropriate, as users need to become accustomed to actually paying for vault usage. Maker Teleport Deployment to StarkNet Summary: This proposal would add StarkNet to Maker Teleport. Initial parameter would be with a 1,000,000 DAI maximum exposure, which would bring the total maximum exposure from Maker Teleport to 3,000,000 (StarkNet, Optimism, and Arbitrum each with 1,000,000). Recommendation: Vote Yes. Maker Teleport is a key strategic asset for Maker\u2019s multi-chain future. It will allow DAI to be officially minted by Maker on each chain and enjoy rapid transport between chains. The work for StarkNet\u2019s addition is completed, and now it is a matter of deploying it and observing it in the wild. Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments Summary: This proposal would direct the following to occur: \u201cThe Strategic Finance Core Unit will co-ordinate the budget re-allocation process with Core Unit, MKR holders and Recognized Delegates\u201d Recommendation: Vote Abstain. It\u2019s not clear how this would be different from what occurs already. Disagreements seem to be in the details or philosophical in nature. That said, it seems fairly harmless as a poll, and we are not actively opposing it. As usual, GFX is supporting the current executive, which follows through on previous commitments. ",

                    "content": "1 Poll Ending Aug 15 Greenlight Poll: Pando Summary: This poll asks whether Pando Investment Grade Climate Assets should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by the Core Units. Details of the collateral can be found here. They are generally a pool of rated solar loans originated by Mosaic Solar, Inc. The yield for Maker would be 2%, with an expected term of 14 years. This would be amortizing (shrinking in balance). Recommendation: Vote Abstain. To be frank, the yield is not suitable when it is significantly below similar maturity yields on US Treasuries, which do not bear credit risk. The duration of this collateral also seems inappropriate for MakerDAO\u2019s limited ability to design and execute a portfolio-wide strategy. Additionally, there does not appear to be junior capital at stake (only yield) for Pando. With that in mind, however, Pando is presenting the collateral as a value proposition partly on Maker\u2019s Clean Money sentiment. The symbolic value of approving this collateral pool is difficult to judge, making it difficult to understand if it offsets the weaknesses of the financial structuring of the deal. 6 Polls Ending Aug 22 Modify Dai Foundation CU Budget Summary: This proposal requests a budget of either 723,357 DAI, 667,055 DAI, or 325,688 DAI to continue funding Dai Fonden over the next 12 months. Dai Fonden a Danish foundation which holds much of the intellectual property related to the Maker protocol. This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote 667,055 DAI budget. The Dai Foundation safeguards important trademarks such as the Dai and Maker trademarks. This includes taking action against misuse of Maker-related intellectual property and defending the legitimate use of that intellectual property. Because MakerDAO is a loose collection of individuals and entities that develop and market the Maker protocol software, it is not a legal entity and cannot own these intellectual properties in its own right. Funding Dai Fonden is a necessary expense, but does not require the highest requested amount, given that there is no major litigation on the horizon and budgets are currently constrained. Amendments to Core Unit Offboarding Process (MIP4c2-SP15) Summary: This proposal amends the core unit offboarding process with enhancements to streamline and make more orderly the offboarding and unwinding process. The goal is to make the process less disruptive to the overall DAO, and the specific details can be found here. Recommendation: Vote Yes. An early version of this was initiated by GFX, and further refined to the current form by @twblack88. These changes represent a much-needed upgrade to the offboarding process. Modify Oracles Core Unit Budget Summary: This proposal requests either 5,061,125 DAI or 4,554,575 DAI over the next 12 months. The lower budget request is accompanied by a commitment from Maker governance to exclude Oracles CU from any future budget cuts for the duration of this budget period. This budget does not include ETH for oracle contract gas. This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote 4,554,575 DAI budget. Oracles represent critical infrastructure for the Maker protocol, and cannot be quickly replaced should it not be fully maintained. While we are uncomfortable with committing to shield Oracles CU from any further budget reductions irrespective of the fiscal state of the protocol, the good faith compromise offered here is a good deal, and we believe governance should take it. MIP76: Makershire Redux Summary: This proposal creates a 10,000,000 DAI pool for yield generation in DeFi protocols. The mandate would only support stable LPs. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This revised proposal removes the dependence in previous versions upon multi-sigs and has a scope limited to stablecoin strategies related to DAI, USDC, and USDP. With revenues appearing to have bottomed, utilizing some of the Surplus Buffer for an experiment seems appropriate. Offboarding Events Core Unit Summary: This set of proposals would offboard the Events Core Unit, removing all budget and providing a one-time payment of 103,336 DAI as a \u201cgolden parachute.\u201d Recommendation: Vote No. This is a difficult decision. We are fully in agreement that Maker does not need this core unit, and support it being offboarded or subsumed under another core unit that could properly direct its efforts. The creeping process by which this core unit was onboarded also makes us uncomfortable. That being said, this core unit is the newest in MakerDAO. It is slated for offboarding before having a track record to evaluate. Maker governance needs to break from its reputation of mercurial changes in policy, and it is too early to remove this core unit. With immediate improvements in the offboarding process being voted upon right now and coming harmonization of budget cycles, we recommend against a disorderly offboarding at this time. Without a strong pivot to uses other than pure social events or demonstrable evidence of value by the time this core unit has been active for 6 months, we will still support future offboarding once the amendments to core unit offboarding have been approved. The current recommendation is based upon procedural grounds and concern for reputational risk. Initiatives like the Governance Voting Initiative announced two days ago are directionally what would make us comfortable maintaining the budget for this core unit. After review, GFX is as usual supporting the current executive, which includes execution of previously approved actions and steps to reverse the DAI flow from Genesis. ",

Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to do that without first assessing needs and priorities, as well as accounting for the current financial position. This poll should be revisited once other questions large (like strategic direction) and small (like exactly which wallets are DAI belonging to core units vs the DAO) are answered first. Collateral Onboarding Project Based Funding Request Summary: This proposal asks for MKR tokenholder approval for the Collateral Engineering Services (CES) CU to spend up to 44,000 of the professional services line item and 55,000 of the contingency buffer line item for assorted expenses related to onboarding and maintenance of real-world assets. Recommendation: Abstain. In our opinion, CES does not need permission to utilize already-allocated resources for activities within its mandate. 3 Polls Ending Aug 29 Greenlight Poll: BlockTower Credit Summary: This poll asks whether BlockTower Credit should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol. Recommendation: Vote Yes. BlockTower is offering junior capital, attractive yield, and is itself a top 15 MKR holder. The risk-reward deserves evaluation and initiating the due diligence process. Greenlight Poll: Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC Summary: This poll asks whether Cabot Renewable Energy Crypto Mining LLC should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol. Recommendation: Vote No. The main collateral for this proposal are around 3,000 MicroBT M30+ mining machines. A casual search of prices shows even at the high end these machines appear to cost $4,000/each. Even allowing for no depreciation of the machines, that provides a 100% LTV. When adding in the additional complexity of a novel jurisdiction in Paraguay, this proposal would require too much work for an already strained RWA pipeline. Greenlight Poll: Detox Digital Coin (DDC) Summary: This poll asks whether DDC (Detox Digital Coin) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol. Recommendation: Vote No. This project seeks financing to develop US commercial real estate for substance abuse recovery facilities. Given the refinance/market risk for exiting the portfolio once it is fully developed and the niche market where Maker has no existing expertise, this project is not a good fit for Maker at this time, and would add to the pressure of the current RWA pipeline. We wish the applicant the best in addressing this very real need. ",

                    "content": "2 Polls Closing September 1 Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal provides two buckets of parameters to change, with two affirmative options: Option 1: Increase the WSTETH-B Maximum Debt Ceiling from 100 million DAI to 200 million DAI. Increase the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling from 5 million DAI to 50 million DAI. Increase the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Target Available Debt from 3 million DAI to 10 million DAI. Decrease the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Stability Fee from 2.25% to 2.0%. Decrease the MANA-A Stability Fee from 6% to 4.5%. Option 2: All of Option 1, as well as Decrease the ETH-A Stability Fee from 2.25% to 1.5%. Decrease the ETH-B Stability Fee from 3.75% to 3.0%. Decrease the WSTETH-A Stability Fee from 2.25% to 1.5%. Decrease the WBTC-A Stability Fee from 2.25% to 2%. Decrease the WBTC-B Stability Fee from 3.75% to 3.5%. Decrease the RENBTC-A Stability Fee from 2.5% to 2.25%. NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Abstain. Because MakerDAO rates have the potential to influence the overall DeFi rates markets and GFX Labs\u2019 involvement with Interest Protocol, GFX Labs is generally abstaining from granular rates adjustments for the foreseeable future. SPF: Legal Domain Work on Greenlit Collateral (bIBTA) Summary: This Special Purpose Fund would provide 50,000 DAI to Strategic Finance Core Unit to reimburse for legal expenses related to due diligence and onboarding bIBTA. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Strategic Finance has agreed to front this expense after the unexpected deterioration of the Real World Finance Core Unit has left it inoperable. This is a modest expense, and the bulk of legal expenses are usually being shouldered by applicants, which accounts for the small size of the allocation. As usual, GFX Labs supported the previous and current executive spells, which mainly contained executables related to HVBC and Maker Teleport ",

                    "content": "4 Polls Ending September 8, 2022 MIP55c3-SP8: Legal Work on MIP65 Special Purpose Fund Summary: This special purpose fund would reimburse Strategic Finance (SF-001) Core Unit for advancing funds for legal work on MIP65. This special purpose fund is for a one-time allotment of 30,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is reimbursement to SF-001 for work that would normally have paid for by RWF-001 prior to that latter core unit\u2019s decision to halt ongoing work. MIP4c3-SP4: MIP65 Amendments Summary: This amendment would remove the requirement of the RWF-001 facilitator to verify legal and governance process appropriateness under MIP65. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This change was endorsed by the current RWF-001 facilitator, whose core unit appears to be winding down. MKR Pro-Rata Vesting for Former RWF-001 Members Summary: This proposal would distribute 121.42 MKR divided between two former RWF-001 contributors who left/were terminated by the RWF-001 facilitator prior to their MKR vesting cliff. Recommendation: Vote No. The cliff of vesting exists for a reason. If these contributors found employment within a current or new Core Unit, their vesting would resume. But neither made it the one-year cliff. This poll is already being used to ask for further exceptions by the Strategic Happiness Core Unit facilitator. The RWF-001 disintegration is regrettable, but a contributor\u2019s relationship is with their facilitator, not with the DAO, which informally contracts with the facilitator. Updating HVBank Legal Agreements (RWA-009) Summary: This proposal makes some changes to the underlying documentation for the Huntingdon Valley Bank legal agreements. The details may be found at the proposal link, but can be described as a slight expansion of authorized loan types for the HVBC portfolio. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This does represent an expanded number of explicitly authorized loan types, such as bridge loans. This seems within the original intended scope of the deal, however. Other changes are similarly looser, but only marginally so \u2013 such as minimum credit score being replaced with an average credit score. This is acceptable and has been recommended by MakerDAO\u2019s legal advisors. 3 Polls Ending September 19, 2022 Greenlight Poll - GUNI-V3-BUSD/DAI Summary: This poll asks whether this asset should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by Core Units. Recommendation: Vote No. This asset has a TVL of $535.30 as of writing. Maker does not need to bootstrap BUSD-DAI liquidity, no material revenues typically emerge from G-UNI vaults, and there is no clear market for this. If Arrakis Finance wishes to subsidize Maker\u2019s oracle costs or demonstrate a large market demand, then this would be worth reconsidering. Greenlight Poll - UNI-V3-wBTC/renBTC Summary: This poll asks whether this asset should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by Core Units. NB: This is poll, despite the title, is indicated to be for Gamma Strategies\u2019 ERC-20 token (similar to Arrakis\u2019 tokens) for the underlying pool mentioned. Recommendation: Vote No. This asset has not yet launched, and similar ones (a bespoke pool with more limited governance just for Maker onboarding) are low TVL. See the same reasoning as the one for G-UNI BUSD/DAI above. If Gamma wishes to subsidize Maker\u2019s oracle costs or demonstrate a large market demand, then this would be worth reconsidering. Greenlight Poll - GNO Summary: This poll asks whether this asset should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol by Core Units. Recommendation: Vote No. Given Maker\u2019s costly oracles, it\u2019s unclear how this asset could generate enough debt to pay for itself. Liquidity begins to deteriorate before $2m of swaps on decentralized exchanges, suggesting this asset could not be both safely and profitably onboarded without either cheaper oracles or an alternative liquidation backstop. As usual, GFX Labs supported the current executive spell, which included a number of previously approved distributions and parameter changes. ",

Recommendation: Vote Yes. These are uncertain times where governance is undergoing structural changes, but like the now-closed HVBC deal, this appears to be worth expending effort on. Access to highly regulated, stable markets like Canadian mortgage lending offers diversification and yield that the Maker protocol needs. 6 Polls Ending September 26, 2022 Amend Measurement Period for Delegate Participation Metrics Summary: This proposal would alter the measurement period for Recognized Delegate participation and communication from a cumulative lifetime total to a rolling 120-day window under MIP61c2. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This would encourage delegates to remain active after periods of personal absence by allowing for rehabilitation without waiting months to become eligible for payment again. GFX Labs authored this proposal. MakerDAO Delegates MIP Set Summary: These three MIPs (77, 78, and 79) would superceded MIP61 to govern the Recognized Delegate Program. MIP 77 revises the responsibilities of Recognized Delegates, as well as how their participation is tracked. MIP 78 revises delegate DAI compensation by raising the maximum monthly payout, and altering the slope of the curve which determines DAI per MKR delegated. MIP 79 provides the first MKR compensation plan to delegates. This also includes retroactive MKR vesting to delegates that were compensated under MIP61 and the initial Delegate Compensation Trial. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Raising the cap on MKR compensation allows for continuing the trend towards professionalized governance by dedicated teams with specialized expertise. It also finally aligns Recognized Delegate incentives more fully with the protocol by establishing MKR vesting. StarkNet Engineering Core Unit MKR Compensation Summary: This proposal would provide an average of 135 MKR per full-time equivalent annually for 3 years, with a 1-year vesting cliff to the StarkNet Engineering CU. Recommendation: Vote No. This amount is too much, and approximately twice what Oracles Core Unit members receive. The StarkNet CU is deserving of MKR compensation, but it should be in proportion to the ability of the recipients to cause harm or deliver revenue to the protocol. Special Purpose Fund for Ambassador Program Summary: This proposal would disburse 81,000 DAI for the provision of non-English language educational materials about the Maker protocol and MakerDAO. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Maker found some of its earliest adoption outside of the Anglophone world. All DeFi projects need more exposure to, and educational materials for, the non-English speaking population of the world. Particularly for stablecoins, some of the most compelling use cases are outside of the US and Commonwealth countries. GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Compensation Summary: This proposal would provide MKR vesting compensation to the GovAlpha Core Unit. The options are: Option 1 (CU preferred): 200% multiplier applied: 330.27 total MKR (153.61/FTE/year) Option 2: 150% multiplier applied: 247.70 total MKR (115.21/FTE/year) Option 3: 100% multiplier applied: 165.14 total MKR (76.81/FTE/year) Option 4: Reject MKR vesting. NB: This is a ranked choice poll Recommendation: Vote Option 3, Option 2, Option 1. GovAlpha is an important part of MakerDAO, but their ability to deliver revenue to or inflict harm upon the protocol is generally low. MKR vesting should be in proportion to those two capabilities. Strategic Happiness Core Unit Offboarding Summary: This proposal would offboard the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, reducing its budget to 0 and removing its facilitator as a mandated actor. A severance of 45,000 DAI would be provided. Recommendation: Vote Yes. MakerDAO is subject to sharp budget constraints, and a core unit focused on swag is not needed. With irregular reporting and oversight, it makes sense to offboard this core unit. ",

The Governance Facilitator holds many points of trusted judgement that are specified by active MIPs. Electing a Governance Facilitator should be done with with great care because of it. Not only are plenty of malicious actions much easier to launch from a trusted Core Unit like GovAlpha, but general incompetence also puts a high tax on the Maker community. I appreciate your vote of confidence that GovAlpha deserves MKR compensation, but must wave a big caution sign at the insinuation that the Core Unit, that maintains all voting portal and MIP related additions, could cause limited harm. @Patrick_J and myself would never abuse this trust, which is why I vouched whole heartily for Patrick\u2019s appointment. But our good intentions should not cover up the great responsibility that comes with being the dedicated Governance Core Unit. ",

                    "content": "2 Polls Closing September 29, 2022 Update rETH Onboarding Parameters Summary: This proposal would set onboarding parameters to the following (making previously approved parameters obsolete where they disagree): Decrease Stability Fee by 0.75%, from 2.25% to 1.5%. Decrease Auction Price Multiplier (buf) by 0.1, from 1.2 to 1.1. Increase Max Auction Drawdown (cusp) by 0.05, from 0.4 to 0.45. Decrease Max Auction Duration (tail) by 20 minutes, from 140 minutes (8,400 seconds) to 120 minutes (7,200 seconds). Decrease Flat Kick Incentive (tip) by 50 DAI, from 300 DAI to 250 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Rates are overall lower and liquidity for rETH higher than when this collateral was initially approved, leading to these updated recommendations by the Risk Core Unit. Collateral Auction Parameter Updates Summary: This proposal would lower the buf parameter by .1 on the following collaterals. The buf parameter is the multiplier for beginning prices on Maker liquidation auctions, so this represents lowering the beginning auction price by 10% of the oracle price. ETH-A ETH-B ETH-C WBTC-A WBTC-B WBTC-C WSTETH-A WSTETH-B CRVV1ETHSTETH-A LINK-A MANA-A MATIC-A RENBTC-A Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is likely to result in shorter settlement time for auctions, from an estimated 9 to 13 minutes, depending upon collateral. It does expose the user to less relief in the event of a rapid recovery in price while collaterals are being auctioned, but quicker auctions protect the protocol against unexpected losses, which is the primary mission of the protocol.

Decrease the YFI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 25 million DAI to 10 million DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. These ilks have potential, but are poorly utilized. The lower rates on the Curve LP are intended to increase usage, and the lower debt ceiling on YFI-A is to lower the maximum exposure on a collateral that is not currently being used at all. Offboarding of YFI may be appropriate if usage cannot get above 0. Approve Multisig for Management of Velodrome NFT Summary: This proposal would approve a \u00be multisig on Optimism to manage voting with an airdrop earmarked for MakerDAO by Velodrome. The 4 signers are all delegates or former delegates: MakerMan, juanbug (Penn Blockchain), ultraschuppi, and rspa (Flipside Crypto). Recommendation: Vote Yes. Ongoing litigation by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) vs Ooki DAO, attempts to establish liability through voting participation. Unlike holding ENS or stkAAVE in the Pause Proxy, this airdropped asset is intended to be used to vote through the Velodrome governance portal, which made this vote more difficult than the formality it was expected to be. That being said, this is not a space where zero risk is practical, and we hope the revenues are worthwhile. Maker is in a much stronger position than most when it comes to political and capital resources to defend itself, and while it should weigh the risk and reward of different actions, should not hide out of fear. As usual, GFX Labs supported the two most recent executive proposals, which formalized already approved actions on chain. ",

                    "content": "5 Polls Ending October 13, 2022 Whitelist Oasis.app on rETH Oracle Summary: This proposal would whitelist Oasis to consume data from the rETH oracle. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This process should be reformed to allow open access. Change Parameters for GUSD-PSM Summary: This proposal would alter the following parameters for the GUSD Peg Stability Module: Increase the PSM-GUSD-A Fee Out (tout) from 0bps to 20bps Increase the PSM-GUSD-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 60 million DAI to 500 million DAI Increase the PSM-GUSD-A Target Available Debt (gap) from 10 million DAI to 50 million DAI Recommendation: Vote No. Increasing the line and gap seems entirely appropriate in light of the unilateral offer of Gemini to provide revenue sharing when the PSM is north of 100m GUSD. Adding a fee on the removal of stables from any PSM, however, is inappropriate, and represents a major reversal of one of the most consistent policies MakerDAO governance has had around the sanctity of peg management. If GUSD is meant to be escrowed away from the market to realize yield, that is entirely acceptable, but should be done so by either re-branding the GUSD PSM as a GUSD vault or some other means. Adding capital controls to any PSM directly contradicts the very name of the facility \u2013 Peg Stability Module \u2013 and the two concepts of yield generation and liquidity management should not generally be commingled. End DAI Funding For SourceCred Summary: This proposal would discontinue SourceCred compensation after October 2022. Recommendation: Vote No. SourceCred has been credited with being the initial nudge that brought many prominent community members into the DAO from social media. It has a strong potential to convert casual members of the community into contributing members. While we recognize that forum discourse has deteriorated in the last several quarters, we would prefer to see GovAlpha seek a mandate to use more discretion in setting parameters for SourceCred, gating its access, or rolling out more substitutes (like off-chain bounties) than ending the program entirely. Remove ETH Supply Yield and Liquidity Incentives from D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations Summary: This proposal would remove LM and yield as part of the calculations of Maker D3M utilization. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. GFX Labs is involved with Interest Protocol, a competitor to Aave, the only deployed D3m at present. Allowed Spread Between D3M Borrow Rate and ETH-A Stability Fee Summary: This proposal would alter the allowed spread between targeted D3M borrow rate (bar parameter) and the ETH-A Stability Fee. Option 1 - 0.5% - implies bar of 2%, 90 million DAI exposure at 30% real supply cap, 680,000 DAI annual revenue. Option 2 - 0% - implies bar of 1.5%, 105 million DAI exposure at 30% real supply cap, 730,000 DAI annual revenue. Option 3 - Reject Options. NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Abstain. GFX Labs is involved with Interest Protocol, a competitor to Aave, the only deployed D3M at present. 1 Poll Ending October 17, 2022 Greenlight Poll: ANCHORAGE Summary: This poll asks whether the asset ANCHORAGE (Anchorage Lending Crypto Mining) should be prioritized for inclusion in the Maker Protocol. Recommendation: Vote No. Maker currently has no operational Real World Finance Core Unit, and simply cannot at present perform due diligence required. ",

Given the lengthy nature of discussions around the End Game and the voluminous material available to summarize, we will simply point curious readers to LongForWisdom\u2019s summaries as a starting point, which can be found here. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This represents the largest package of reforms to MakerDAO governance ever proposed. As would be expected with a large number of concepts that interact with each other, there is something in this package for everyone to like and dislike. On balance, we feel these reforms are a positive step forward, and represent a return to MakerDAO turning its attention to the Maker Protocol, while offloading legal, microeconomic, and specialized tasks to the metaDAOs. We look forward to offering assistance in resolving some of the implementation details that are still to be mapped out, and doing what we can to make this new initiative successful. Offboarding Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Summary: This proposal would offboard SH-001, and provide 43,332 DAI and 26.04 MKR as offboarding relief to the facilitator. Recommendation: Vote Yes. MakerDAO is currently constrained by budget, and this Core Unit provides non-essential services that can no longer be supported financially. Offboarding Events (EVENTS-001) Summary: This proposal would offboard EVENTS-001, and provide 88,332 DAI as offboarding relief to its two contributors. Recommendation: Vote Yes. MakerDAO is currently constrained by budget, and this Core Unit provides non-essential services that can no longer be supported financially. Offboarding Real World Finance (RWF-001) Summary: This proposal would offboard RWF-001, and provide up to 60,000 DAI and 201.46 MKR as offboarding relief to its facilitator and two former contributors. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This Core Unit has been non-operational since the end of July, yet the facilitator has continued to draw around 100,000 DAI per month for expenses while no publicly visible work has been completed. The outgoing facilitator has insinuated he would pursue legal action against several parties if he were not continued to be paid. Providing him continued support during offboarding is distasteful, but will hopefully put an end to the long, drawn-out affair. It is time to move on from the mixed legacy left by this Core Unit, even if it requires payment to do so. MIP81: Coinbase Institutional Rewards Summary: This proposal would authorize use of Coinbase\u2019s custodial services, which would pay between 100 and 150 bps on USDC deposited therein. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Concerns over whether USDC would in fact be retrievable at will from Coinbase can be alleviated by technical solutions. The yield on this is not particularly compelling, but Coinbase is an acceptable parking place for funds that are otherwise idle and earning zero yield. They should be retrieved when needed for the PSM or for a better-yielding opportunity, which makes this likely to be utilized for only a short period of time. MIP82: Monetalis Coinbase-Apaloosa Summary: This proposal would provide 500,000,000 DAI to Monetalis, which would then lend to Coinbase against ETH and BTC collateral. Yield from Coinbase to Monetalis is estimated to be between 150 and 300 bps, with a majority portion of that then going to Maker. Final terms would be subject to a poll before executing. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. Monetalis already holds authorization for a 500,000,000 vault for Monetalis Clydesdale. Assuming that vault is utilized to capacity, it is difficult to be enthusiastic about increasing the already concentrated counterparty risk this and two other proposed Monetalis deals would bring without first growing DAI supply. There may be room for more collaboration with Monetalis, but any additional deals such as Apaloosa, Freisian, or Andalusian would provide larger counterparty exposure to Monetalis \u2013 a new firm that has to date only deployed 1,000,000 DAI \u2013 than to Paxos (through the USDP PSM). We would prefer to see no single counterparty responsible for more than 10% of DAI in existence or 25% of stablecoin reserves. MIP55c3-SP9: Legal and Commercial Risk Domain Work for BlockTower Summary: This proposal earmarks 258,000 DAI to pay for an estimated three months of legal and risk domain work to evaluate the greenlit proposal from BlockTower. Two specific individuals have been named to perform this work. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The BlockTower proposal was greenlit, so someone is required to do the work that should have been performed or funded by the Real World Finance Core Unit, which has continued to draw funds but has not met its obligations under its mandate. The two contributors named to do this work previously performed similar work under the RWF-001 CU. MIP41c5 Amendments Summary: This subproposal would alter language and add detail around how facilitators are offboarded. Recommendation: Vote Yes. There will likely still need to be further iterations on this process, but clearly separating the process for offboarding a facilitator from that of a Core Unit seems appropriate. This amendment describes how powers are bounded during an unwinding process and also shortens the RFC period for facilitator offboardings. Quicker resolution (in either direction) of a facilitator offboarding is probably good, and perhaps even less than the 2 weeks in this amendment would be acceptable, since any facilitator offboarding involuntarily likely stems from high profile incidents. Facilitator Offboarding: RWF-001 Summary: This proposal would offboard the facilitator of RWF-001. NB: This proposal is separate from the RWF-001 Core Unit offboarding and provides no offboarding relief payment to the facilitator. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This facilitator has continued to draw pay while actively neglecting the mandate his CU was charged with since the end of July 2022. ",

                    "content": "3 Polls Ending November 3, 2022 Activate Liquidations on Stablecoin Vaults to Clear Bad Debt Summary: This proposal would turn on liquidations for vaults in the following ilks: GUSD-A USDC-A PAXUSD-A Recommendation: Vote Yes. These are vestigial ilks that pre-date the advent of Peg Stability Modules, where users could generate DAI against GUSD, USDC, or USDP. Over time, accrued fees have reduced many of these vaults below the collateralization threshold to avoid liquidations, but liquidations have not been enabled. By allowing liquidations, this will clear the protocol of \u201cphantom DAI\u201d that accrued from stability fees on these abandoned vaults. It is estimated that there is around 1.3m DAI in bad debt, mainly from these three ilks. There may also be some additional costs associated with auctioning off that bad debt. Fees have been disabled and all three stablecoins are hard coded to $1 value, so any remaining vaults in these ilks should avoid further liquidation. One Month Budget Extension for Strategic Happiness Core Unit Summary: This proposal would provide 5.21 MKR and 49,999.99 DAI for the former Strategic Happines CU to continue operations for one month. Recommendation: Vote No. This core unit was offboarded to reduce expenses. Maker Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal would: Reduce the MANA-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) from 17 million DAI to 10 million DAI. Increase the MANA-A Stability Fee from 4.5% to 7.5%. Onboard Compound V2 D3M with a Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) of 160 million DAI. Onboard Compound V2 D3M with a Target Available Debt (gap) of 10 million DAI. Onboard Compound V2 D3M with a Target Borrow Rate (bar) of 2%. Recommendation: Vote Yes. GFX Labs first proposed a D3M for Compound in December 2021. We fully support the implementation after nearly a year of work. The changes to MANA are recommended by Risk, and we agree with their recommendation. As per usual policy, GFX Labs supported the current and previous executives, which included previously authorized changes and disbursements. Please click through for details of the spell contents.

                    "content": "1 Poll Ending November 17, 2022 Stablecoin Vault Liquidation Parameters Summary: This proposal would alter the following parameters: Enable Liquidations. Use Linear Decrease for Auction Price Function (calc). Set Liquidation Penalty (chop) to 0. Set Proportional Kick Incentive (chip) to 0. Set Flat Kick Incentive (tip) to 0. Set Auction Price Multiplier (buf) to 1. Set tau to 4,320,000 seconds (72,000 minutes, or 1,200 hours). This results in an estimated 10bps drop in price every 72 minutes, or 50 days until the price reaches 0. Set Max Auction Duration (tail) to 43,200 secpnds (720 minutes, or 12 hours). This implies a minimum price of 0.99. Set Max Auction Drawdown (cusp) to 0.99. Individually set the Local Liquidation Limit (ilk.hole) for the vault types as follows: USDC-A - 20 million DAI USDP-A - 3 million DAI GUSD-A - 300,000 DAI Recommendation: Vote Yes. These are vestigial stablecoin ilks that pre-date the Peg Stability Module. While inflows are not allowed, there is still substantial debt accrued to vaults in these ilks. Enabling liquidations will clear the system of bad debt on several of these. NB: GFX Labs missed the deadline to vote on this poll, but this communication was prepared ahead of time and indicates how we would have voted had we done so. 13 Polls Ending November 28, 2022 Immunefi Security Facilitator Onboarding Summary: This proposal would onboard Joshua Pritikin (aka Psychonaut) as co-facilitator of the IS-001 CU. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This facilitator onboarding has failed in the past, and we are not aware of anything that has changed. That being said, Pritikin is clearly performing all facilitator duties for this core unit, and the current facilitator is not involved or even drawing a salary as far as we are aware. This represents a title change and addition of mandated actor status only. Budget Modification: DUX-001 Summary: This proposal establishes the next budget for DUX-001. Options are: Option 0: Abstain. Option 1: Approve existing budget only (Business as usual): 1,871,300 DAI Option 2: Approve reduced budget (NewBase): 1,611,420 DAI Option 3: Approve reduced budget (NewBear): 1,426,416 DAI Option 4: Reject budget. NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote Option 2 (NewBase), Option 3 (NewBear), Option 1 (Business as usual). The Development and UX Core Unit has generally done a good job maintaining the voting portal and working on some future initiatives for the launch of metaDAOs. That said, budget is a binding constraint for MakerDAO. Option 2 represents ~14% budget reduction, which is acceptable. MIP86: CoinShares Active Treasury Management Summary: This proposal would onboard CoinShares to manage a portfolio of 100,000,000-500,000,000 DAI with an aim to construct a portfolio of bonds that are relatively liquid, interest rate insensitive, and with a return above SOFR. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. While adding yet another name to the list of counterparties that could create an insolvent Maker in a black swan event is not a positive, the diversification away from highly concentrated counterparties is almost enough to offset that concern. The relatively conservative mandate laid out in MIP86 combined with governance selecting the exposure without needing a new MIP mitigates in our mind some risks. Keeping this deal on par with that of HVBC seems very appropriate, and is not so far from the existing Surplus Buffer that Maker would have no chance of surviving the unlikely event of the investment going to zero with no recovery at all. That being said, however, Maker currently has no clear oversight or monitoring of most RWA counterparties or their collateral. This needs to be clearly remedied, and immediately. Relatedly, CoinShares\u2019 apparent misfortune of having what appears to be 10% of assets stranded at FTX suggests that this proposal needs to be tabled and revisited at a later date. We are conceptually supportive, but in light of current market conditions and Maker\u2019s unclear financial position in a fast-paced environment, we would like more time and for the DAO to direct resources to due diligence. MIP87: OUSD Decentralized Rewards Summary: This proposal would authorize the deployment of up to 100,000,000 DAI into OUSD, which deploys DAI, USDC, and USDT for yield farming as a means of creating daily yield for OUSD holders. Recommendation: Vote No. Maker\u2019s Risk Core Unit contributors have vehemently provided a negative recommendation. Many of their concerns can be found here, complete with details. We generally require a high bar to override a negative recommendation from the Risk Core Unit, and so will vote No. Modify Immunefi Security (IS-001) Mandate Summary: This proposal would alter the IS-001 mandate from the original to the proposed text (both found at links). Recommendation: Vote Yes. The new text largely elaborates upon the original in more detail, and explicitly places the MIP64 bug bounty program under the purview of IS-001. Budget Modification: IS-001 Summary: This proposal establishes the next annual budget for IS-001: Option 0: Abstain. Option 1: Approve existing budget (Business as usual): 786,830 DAI. Option 2: Approve reduced budget (BearMarket): 427,790 DAI. Option 3: Reject budget. NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote Option 2 (BearMarket), Option 3 (Reject Budget). This core unit largely administers the bug bounty program, incident response assistance, and educational resources for security. The lower budget seems adequate given that bug bounty payments are already authorized to come from general protocol resources as they occur under MIP64. Budget Modification: COM-001 Summary: This proposal establishes the next biannual budget for COM-001, which would be 258,807 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This core unit budget already reflects significant reductions, which should be rewarded. Budget Modification: SAS-001 Summary: This proposal establishes the next budget for SAS-001: Option 1: Approve new base budget: 433,375 DAI seed transfer and 1,040,100 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 2: Approve new bear budget: 394,562.50 DAI seed transfer and 946,950 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 3: Reject budget. Recommendation: Vote Option 3 (Reject Budget). This CU focuses on building out a unified interface for various auctions. After a year, it\u2019s not clear that these tools see much use. Given the budget constraints for MakerDAO, this doesn\u2019t seem like a prudent use of resources going forward. If a drastically reduced budget was proposed, perhaps that would be appropriate. Alternatively, it may be time to discuss offboarding and appropriate winding down packages for the contributors, particularly if consistent use of these tools cannot be demonstrated. Budget Modification: TECH-001 Summary: This proposal establishes the next annual budget for TECH-001, which would be 3,148,685 DAI in total. Recommendation: Vote No. The most mission-critical responsibility under the TechOps CU mandate is the maintenance of keepers to perform various (non-liquidation) functions in the protocol. TechOps is no longer the sole keeper for these functions, as Keep3r Network, Gelato, and Chainlink are also performing these duties. While maintenance of forum, website, Discord, and monitoring/alerts are important, a total spend of greater than 3 million DAI seems far too much \u2013 as reference, this is greater than the annual budget for Collateral Engineering Services CU, Growth CU, or Risk CU. Modify Emulated Surplus Buffer Upper Limit Summary: This proposal would set the upper bound for the MIP84 emulated surplus buffer to 1,000,000,000 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. The practical effect of this change would be to indefinitely delay the POVE (using protocol funds to invest in stETH) until the upper limit is reduced. This generally seems advisable in the current market environment. There has not, however, been an initiation of the POVE despite its authorization, and would prefer to revisit the appropriate buffer limit at initiation, so as to better reflect the reality of conditions at that time. MIP88: Monetalis-Redwood Freisian Summary: This proposal would authorize a vault for Monetalis to draw 225,000,000 DAI to purchase RMBS. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. Monetalis already holds authorization for a total of 1,000,000,000 DAI for Monetalis Clydesdale and Apaloosa. Assuming those vaults are utilized to capacity, it is difficult to be enthusiastic about increasing the already concentrated counterparty risk this would bring without first growing DAI supply dramatically. There may be room for more collaboration with Monetalis, but any additional deals such as Freisian or Andalusian would provide even larger counterparty exposure to Monetalis \u2013 a new firm that has not yet been given an opportunity to establish a track record. We would prefer to see no single counterparty responsible for more than 10% of DAI in existence or 25% of stablecoin reserves. MIP89: Monetalis-Arrow Andalusian Summary: This proposal would authorize a vault for Monetalis to draw 300,000,000 DAI to purchase ETF products backed by \u201cgreen\u201d lending and investments. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. Monetalis already holds authorization for a total of 1,000,000,000 DAI for Monetalis Clydesdale and Apaloosa. Assuming those vaults are utilized to capacity, it is difficult to be enthusiastic about increasing the already concentrated counterparty risk this would bring without first growing DAI supply dramatically. There may be room for more collaboration with Monetalis, but any additional deals such as Freisian or Andalusian would provide even larger counterparty exposure to Monetalis \u2013 a new firm that has not yet been given an opportunity to establish a track record. We would prefer to see no single counterparty responsible for more than 10% of DAI in existence or 25% of stablecoin reserves. Budget Modification: SES-001 Summary: This proposal establishes the next budget for SES-001: Option 1: Approve standard option budget: 2,719,200 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 2: Approve speedy operations platform option budget: 3,199,200 DAI streamed over twelve months. Option 3: Reject budget. Recommendation: Vote Option 1 (Standard), Option 3 (Reject Budget). There is no demonstrated need for a higher budget. An option for a slightly lower budget would have been preferred, but not strongly enough to reject this budget outright. As is GFX Labs policy, we have supported the current and previous executives, which included changes already approved by governance and discussed individually in each poll upthread. ",

                    "content": "4 Polls Ending November 24, 2022 Add GNO As New Vault Type Summary: This proposal would add a GNO ilk with 2.5% stability fee and 5,000,000 DAI debt ceiling and 350% liquidation threshold. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This token has low liquidity, and slippage begins around 500,000 according to 1inch. However, with a LTV of around 23%, the protocol should be able to avoid losses through conservative support for GNO. Maker\u2019s supported collaterals have dwindled over the last year. It\u2019s worth experimenting with GNO. Add Multiple BlockTower Credit Vault Types Summary: This proposal would add four vaults for BlockTower Credit with debt ceilings of 20,000,000 DAI, 30,000,000 DAI, 30,000,000 DAI, and 70,000,000 DAI. All would have 4% stability fee. These vaults would be utilized to finance: Senior-secured, asset-backed facilities Forward Flow Agreements Whole loans and receivable purchases Structured Credit Products: Investment grade asset-backed securities (bonds) Recommendation: Vote Yes. To be perfectly frank, this is not a stellar deal for Maker. The assets are not cross-collateralized and there is no cash flowing directly to Maker on a regular timetable (NB: flows to the Tinlake platform are not identical to cash flowing to the Maker protocol, since that represents appreciation if the cash stays at Tinlake or other off-Maker reserves, or a revolving of the credit line if it is reinvested). Much like traditional permissionless vaults, this means the protocol\u2019s exposure grows over time due to the accumulation of fees unless the borrower chooses to repay vault debt prior to closing the position or liquidation. The 4% yield is also not especially compelling given the time period of up to 48 months. The risk-free rate for 1 year is currently hovering around 4.7% and 4-year around 4.25%. Given the lengthy credit chain between Maker and the underlying assets, this is obviously not a risk-free investment. With that being said, the levels of junior capital offered by BlockTower suggest this is unlikely to be a dangerous deal for Maker on a financial basis. This proposal also marks a departure from some previous large-scale vaults where de minimis junior capital is present and yields even lower. As a result, this offering represents an upgrade in terms for Maker, even if the terms do not garner our enthusiastic endorsement. We should also note that there have been two different core units (two different engineering CUs) that have highlighted the technical risk of how this is being structured. Given that Maker is participating directly in these offerings, the technical risk and complexity by intermediating Centrifuge is not desirable. We strongly believe that Maker vaults should custody the actual tokenized collateral rather than a valueless dummy token. Particularly given Maker\u2019s limited legal leverage in the event of unforeseen events, it seems strange to continue to custody the actual DROP tokens \u2013 which are the collateral for Maker\u2019s purposes \u2013 at a third party. In summary, there are technical risks associated with this deal that we do not like and had hoped to see remedied after a year and a half of collaboration with various Centrifuge projects, and the financial returns seem very low. Compared to alternative opportunities, however, BlockTower is on balance offering an arrangement that is an improvement over previous ones, and so we vote yes. Offboarding Parameters for renBTC-A Summary: This proposal completes the offboarding of renBTC-A. This is being done as an expedited offboarding under MIP62. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Given uncertainty around Ren in the wake of Alameda\u2019s bankruptcy, as well as the parallel deployment of Ren V2 while V1 is being deprecated (mints already disabled), it is appropriate to expedite this offboarding in case the peg for this asset becomes unstable. Total debt is less than 1,000,000 DAI. Proceed With Pre-Implementation Work For BlockTower\u2019s MIP90 Summary: This proposal asks if core units should proceed with legal, credit, technical risk analysis of MIP90. MIP90 is not scheduled to be voted upon in January 2023. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. This proposal asks for no additional funding and seeks approval for something already within the mandate of core units. It is unnecessary micromanagement, and core units should be free to proceed or not with such work as they choose until MIP90 is voted upon. ",

                    "content": "3 Polls Ending December 1, 2022 DAI Savings Rate Adjustment Summary: This proposal seeks to set a new DAI Savings Rate (DSR), with the following options: Leave the DAI Savings Rate unchanged at 0.01% Increase the DAI Savings Rate to 0.25% Increase the DAI Savings Rate to 0.5% Increase the DAI Savings Rate to 0.75% Increase the DAI Savings Rate to 1% NB: This is a ranked choice poll Recommendation: Vote Leave the DSR unchanged at .01%. The DSR may be appropriate to activate, but more information is required to make an informed decision. Firstly, it would be helpful to have an inventory of historical integrations, and how many of those are still maintained. Knowing this would help estimate the likelihood of uptake by DAI users. Secondly, Maker would need to begin monitoring its net interest rate margin, and someone needs to be explicitly tasked with that (our preference is @Risk-Core-Unit). On the surface, this appears like it could lead to adverse selection where Maker is effectively subsidizing Lido staked ETH \u2013 users borrow conservatively against it at 0% currently, and then get additional yield carrying the DAI. While from a user perspective this is already the case when they park their borrowed DAI on Compound/Aave, using the DSR then has Maker both holding the risk of the collateral and paying for the privilege to do so (rather than Aave/Compound DAI borrowers paying to do so). Risk under @Primoz has a history of tracking such nuances, and we feel they should be explicitly mandated to monitor these risks, volunteer to do so, or some new actor be tasked with that role. Thirdly, if Maker is finally ready to reactivate the DSR, we would prefer to take a slower approach and instruct @Growth-Core-Unit under @Nadia to leverage any coming raise in any way possible to secure or reactivate integrations. GFX Labs is supportive of a reactivated DSR, but feel any such changes can be safer and more useful with a plan. We encourage champions of DSR reactivation like @hexonaut and @monet-supply to continue to advocate for it as an execution strategy is built out over another few weeks. Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal would enact a variety of parameter changes, the most notable of which being increased maximum debt ceilings for stETH, and reduced ones for wBTC, ETH, and Gelato UNI ilks. It also sets MANA debt ceiling to 0, and increases the cap on the Compound D3M from 5,000,000 DAI to 10,000,000 DAI. A more detailed list of parameter adjustments proposed can be found here. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The changes proposed are all reasonable and the explanation for them by the committee was also reasonable. Undertake Necessary Risk and Legal Assessments to Increase NS-DROP Debt Ceiling to 50,000,000 DAI Summary: This proposal instructs the Strategic Finance CU to conduct legal and risk assessments required for an informed vote on whether to raise New Silver\u2019s debt ceiling. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This needs to be completed prior to an informed vote, and New Silver \u2013 as the oldest non-stablecoin RWA supported by the protocol, and with a history of repayment \u2013 deserves a vote on their request to raise their debt ceiling (and fee).

Recommendation: Vote Yes. Kat has communicated a desire to step back from this program. We wish her the best of luck with all her current and future endeavors. Dai Foundation Board Election Summary: MakerDAO may appoint one board seat for Dai Fonden. The choices are: Daimon-Law 0xbocaJ Abstain Neither NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote Neither. This is not a vote declaring both candidates unfit, but a recognition that more time is needed to evaluate the two candidates. In particular, Daimon-Law\u2019s possible conflicts within the Avalanche ecosystem and CLO position at Pangolin Exchange, as well as 0xbocaJ\u2019s role as advisor to Redwood Trust, which is an entity recently approved as an end borrower through a Monetalis initiative, both warrant more time and consideration. Sidestream Auction Services (SAS-001) Funding Request Summary: This proposal would authorize SAS CU to continue using its previous budget beyond its original end date. This would not result in the transfer of new funds. Recommendation: Vote No. Sidestream\u2019s budget was recently rejected. We feel the core unit\u2019s function is no longer needed, and would prefer to see a budget for unwinding or being absorbed by other core units. GovComms (COM-001) Funding Request Summary: This proposal would authorize COM-001 to continue using its previous budget beyond its original end date, with the intention of using those funds for orderly winding down. This would not result in the transfer of new funds. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is reasonable, and offboarding relief for contributors will be handled separately through the formal offboarding proposal that is currently in RFC. Ratification Poll For Pioneer DeFi-focused Language Dataset for the Benefit of Risk Modelling & Governance Communication Summary: This proposal would provide 50,000 DAI for a SPF to create a Large Language Model to inform risk parameters. Recommendation: Vote No. As we understand it, this SPF would fund the training of a model that would monitor sentiment in social media. In our opinion, that has no useful application in Maker\u2019s current risk framework. As per GFX Labs usual policy, the most recent executive was supported, which included a wide array of disbursements, parameter changes, and RWA onboarding work. Details can be found at the executive.

Recommendation: Vote Yes. The details around accelerated vesting for outgoing contributors several months ago are still being worked out, but the interim head of CES needs this MKR to make good on promises to current contributors. Confirm Trial Deployment of DssKiln Summary: This proposal seeks to confirm the previously approved (in June 2022) DssKiln prior to deployment. Voters may choose: Yes; 0.5 million DAI Yes; 1 million DAI Yes; 2 million DAI Yes; 3 million DAI No, do not burn MKR NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote 3 million DAI, 2 million DAI, 1 million DAI. This was already approved for 3,000,000 DAI to purchase MKR to burn. There is no need to poll for it again. Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal includes a number of parameter changes: Increase wstETH-B Stability fee from 0% to 0.25% Increase fees into (tin) PSM-USDP from 0.1% to 0.2% Increase Compound D3M debt ceiling from 5,000,000 to 20,000,000 DAI Increase Aave D3M debt ceiling from 0 to 20,000,000 DAI Recommendation: Vote Yes. Discontinuing fee-free leverage on Lido staked ETH is long overdue. Additionally, increasing D3M activity onto the two largest DAI borrow/lend marketplaces offers much better risk reward than alternative growth avenues. Limiting inflows of USDP is also appropriate, given GUSD remits payment to Maker, and two illiquid fiat stablecoins are probably not needed. Over time, USDP will likely drain out of the PSM a little at a time. 8 of 15 Polls Ending January 23, 2023 Keeper Network Amendment (MIP4c2-SP31) Summary: This proposal provides minor improvements to MIP63, such as fixing typos and specifying a maximum of 6 months\u2019 budget request. Recommendation: Vote Yes. These are iterative improvements. Nothing appears likely to cause a problem. Defense Fund Summary: This proposal would establish a special fund to reimburse Recognized Delegates, Core Unit contributors, and voting MKR holders for expenses related to legal or regulatory actions. 5,000,000 DAI would be used to seed the fund. Specifics of how this fund would operate are subject to a procedures manual that are under development by the companies Gallagher and Artex. This fund would not be applicable to any current or past litigation. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This provides a much-needed way for possible targets to be reimbursed for expenses related to litigation or enforcement actions. That being said, we expect a detailed presentation of the procedural manual once it is ready. We are also voting Yes with the understanding that this fund is only for reimbursement of expenses, and not damages awarded or fines. A fund that covered payouts to plaintiffs would likely attract nuisance lawsuits. MIP92: Onboard PSM USDC to Yearn Summary: This proposal would onboard 100,000,000 USDC to a custom Yearn strategy vault. Yearn takes a 20% performance fee at present. Recommendation: Vote No. The performance fee seems quite high, and most of the strategies currently are relatively simple, so Maker could implement them itself (and probably should). We would be open to a revised version of this proposal that 1) requests DAI rather than direct custody of PSM USDC, 2) lower performance fees, 3) posts YFI or other collateral to share in any downside and not only the upside. If @corn wants input on crafting a new proposal, GFX Labs is willing to provide that. Declaration of Intent: Develop a Comprehensive On-Chain Solution for Monitoring RWA Vaults Summary: This proposal requests within 30 days for external providers to craft Special Purpose Fund (SPF) proposals to monitor RWA vaults. All submitted SPFs would then be voted upon to determine a single winner or no winner for funding. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Maker has struggled to monitor RWA vaults, with no viable solutions being provided historically in the form of oracles or manual monitoring. Building automated solutions for any or all of the monitoring for the disparate RWA vaults is a priority to de-risk the RWA program. This proposal publicly solicits proposals from external actors and signals a willingness to fund them. At worst, no funds are disbursed if all proposals are a poor fit, or if no proposals are forthcoming. While Strategic Finance Core Unit has the current mandate to monitor RWAs, some of its staff are members of the Viridian Cluster, which is itself structured around onboarding RWAs. Having a monitoring solution that assists SF CU in its mandate, and doing so in an arm\u2019s length way, would be closer to best practices. Keeper Network: Onboard Chainlink Automation Summary: This proposal would provide a budget of no more than 1,000 DAI/day to Chainlink for performance of keeper duties. Chainlink has performed ~9% of all keeper calls tracked in makerburn.com Recommendaiton: Vote Yes. The addition of Chainlink to Gelato, Keep3r Network, and Maker\u2019s own keepers creates a comfortable amount of redundancy and assurance that keepers will call various permissionless functions in the Maker Protocol. Special Purpose Fund: Developing Proof-of-Performance for Viridian Cluster Summary: This proposal would provide 500,000 DAI for developing monitoring and due diligence for RWA projects that originated from MIP65, MIP81, and MIP88. Recommendation: Vote No. This proposal is brought forward by the facilitator from the Viridian Cluster. The cluster itself was proposed by the RWA originator that would be monitored. The Strategic Finance Core Unit\u2019s RWA specialist, who is presumably catching up on the monitoring of RWAs already, is also a member of the Viridian Cluster. GFX agrees that better RWA monitoring is very necessary, but paying the Viridian Cluster to monitor its own assets is not using best practices. Maker requires its own monitoring of Viridian Cluster and its assets, not to pay the cluster to monitor itself. Special Purpose Fund: Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWA Summary: This proposal would provide 209,000 DAI for the purposes of paying a structured finance consultant and legal review of RWAs. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The existing SF-001 budget doesn\u2019t account for a RWA mandate. No one else is currently doing this work. There\u2019s little reason not to approve this request, as it is not the first \u2013 and likely not the last \u2013 such request. Protocol DAI Transfer: IS-001 Summary: This proposal would distribute 43,560 DAI to the Immunefi Core Unit. The core unit states they will likely dissolve/offboard in May when this budget is exhausted. The core unit\u2019s previous budget was rejected. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Given the stated intent to wind down operations of the core unit and transition to an ecosystem actor (which does not receive a budget), this transfer is reasonable. In general, though, we do not like separating funding from mandates/authorization, which MIP14 transfers do. As per our usual policy, GFX Labs is supporting the current executive, which contains a variety of already-approved DAI and MKR funding transfers. ",

                    "content": "7 of 15 Polls Closing January 23, 2023 Protocol DAI Transfer: TECH-001 Summary: This proposal would distribute 138,894 DAI to the TechOps Core Unit. The core unit\u2019s previous budget was rejected. Recommendation: Vote Yes. The core unit cannot put forth another budget until March, due to internal procedural constraints. GFX dislikes separating funds transfers from mandates and authorizations. That being said, we will not oppose this based purely on the dislike of MIP14 funds transfers. COM-001 Offboarding Summary: This proposal offboards the GovComms Core Unit. It provides several options for offboarding relief for the contributors. The core unit\u2019s previous budget was rejected. Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 80% Multiplier for retroactive MKR Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 100% Multiplier for retroactive MKR Approve Offboarding, 60,700 DAI Golden Parachute and 120% Multiplier for retroactive MKR Reject Options Abstain NB: This is a ranked choice vote. Recommendation: Vote 80% multiplier for retroactive MKR, 100% multiplier, 120% multiplier. This core unit is being offboarded due to budgetary constraints and a reduced need for their services. They performed their duties satisfactorily during their tenure, and deserve offboarding relief. We wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors. Modify MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) Summary: This proposal would amend MIP14 to remove the 250,000 DAI maximum for a MIP14 transfer. Recommendation: Vote Abstain. GFX Labs would prefer for MIP14 to be retired and a new MIP authored. See our communication on that item for more details. Obsolete MIP Removal of MIPs 23 and 24 Summary: This proposal removes two obsolete MIPs, which no longer contain relevant information or authorizations related to the old Domain Team system under the Maker Foundation. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is just cleaning up the MIPs repository. MIP14 Repeal Summary: This proposal would remove MIP14, which has never seen an approved use to date. Recommendation: Vote Yes. MIP14 imposes arbitrary limits on DAI to be transferred, separates funding approval from authorization of the initiative to be funded, has no oversight mechanisms embedded in it, and can only authorize the transfer of DAI and not other tokens. Modify MIP51c4 (Calendar Exceptions) Summary: This proposal would amend MIP51 to remove the December exception to the monthly governance cycle. Recommendation: Vote No. Urgent matters can still be brought to governance, but having a predefined time for governance to slow down over major holidays (Christmas, New Year\u2019s, et al) also provides time for technical contributors to know major demands from governance are unlikely to occur. Amend MIP61 To Tighten Up Recognized Delegate Compensation Metrics Summary: This proposal seeks to add up to two modifications to MIP61. The first is to add a penalty for delegates with a very large share of Abstain votes. The second is to add a requirement around timing of executive votes and weighting them more highly than standard polls. Approve both Approve only the Abstain Modifier Approve only the Higher Participation Requirements and Weighting for Executive Votes Abstain Reject both changes NB: This is a ranked choice poll. Recommendation: Vote Approve only the Abstain Modifier. The abstain modifier makes some sense, but there\u2019s also the risk of people picking semi-random non-abstain options to avoid a penalty. We do not believe the change in weighting to executive votes is needed, nor an addition of a timing parameter when most delegates need time to review executable code, or refer it to those who can do it on their behalf. 2 Polls Ending January 19, 2023 Adjust GUSD-PSM Debt Ceiling Summary: This poll seeks to find out if Maker holders want to adjust the current maximum exposure of the GUSD-PSM. Abstain Set DC to 0 DAI Set DC to 100,000,000 DAI No Change (500,000,000 DAI) NB: This is a ranked choice vote. Recommendation: No Change (500,000,000 DAI). The first rewards have been delivered as scheduled. As long as the rewards continue, there is not an obvious reason to unwind this arrangement. Our understanding is that GUSD reserves are custodied at the same trio of banks as the USDP reserves (and TUSD as well), and that they are segregated and designed to be bankruptcy remote from Gemini. Given that no new information has become available to suggest otherwise, GFX Labs does not see a need to unwind this arrangement at this time, though it is certainly appropriate to periodically check with the MKR-holding community. Decrease GUSD tout fee to 0 Summary: This poll seeks to lower the fee on outflows from the GUSD-PSM to 0 from 0.1%. Recommendation: Vote No. The GUSD-PSM is a revenue-generating ilk for the Maker Protocol as long as Gemini maintains their marketing incentives program. There is no immediate reason to make it easier for that income to be reduced. For those who feel there is an urgent need to reduce GUSD exposure, neither this poll nor the other current one would actively remove GUSD from the protocol, which likely would require an incentive to accomplish quickly.

Recommendation: Vote Yes. These are vestigial vault classes from several years ago, before the Peg Stability Module was created. These vaults appear to be abandoned, and communications will continue to be ongoing in an attempt to get any affected users to withdraw their stablecoins, which were used as collateral to generate DAI. Adjust The Debt Floor (dust parameter) Summary: This proposal seeks approval to alter the dust parameter for several ilks. Voters may choose from: Option 1 - Broad Reduction Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 5,000 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 2,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 15,000 DAI Reduce dust for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, LINK-A, YFI-A, and MATIC-A to 10,000 DAI Option 2 - Limited Reduction Reduce dust for ETH-A, WBTC-A, and WSTETH-A to 7,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-C, WBTC-C, and WSTETH-B to 3,500 DAI Reduce dust for ETH-B and WBTC-B to 25,000 DAI No Change Keep dust unchanged across all collateral types NB: This is a ranked choice vote. Recommendation: Vote Option 2, No Change. A limited reduction seems appropriate given the lower gas environment. We would prefer to see whether a limited reduction brings in more diverse users of the Maker protocol software before aggressively exposing Maker to the risk of small vaults becoming unprofitable to liquidate, should high gas prices return. We also want to be cautious about going too far and needing to then reverse the decision, as that makes for a bad user experience \u2013 once a user is below the dust limit, they can no longer repay only a portion of their user-generated DAI.

The stated use of these funds is to utilize a JokeDAO contest to offer a bounty to a winning proposal to create an information portal with various resources about the ongoing Endgame initiatives. Recommendation: Vote No. This should be a Special Purpose Fund under MIP55, since it involves deliverables and is not simply a transfer of funds. Strictly speaking, this is a proposal to send 9,999 DAI to an address that has not been specified, and with no formal or informal obligations by either those administering the JokeDAO contest, nor any recipients of the grant/bounty. The cost and concept are fine, but this proposal should utilize best practices.

The multisig would become a 3 of 5 (it is currently a 3 of 4). Recommendation: Vote Yes. Removing a retired delegate and adding two current ones seems appropriate. Open Market Committee Proposal Summary: This proposal would alter a variety of parameters. Notable changes would reduce fees on several ilks and reactivate the Aave V2 D3M with a debt ceiling of 20,000,000 DAI. Fees would also be increased by 25bps on wstETH-B and the Compound D3M increased by 10,000,000 DAI to a toal of 30,000,000. For a full list of all parameter changes proposed, please check the original thread  Recommendation: Vote Yes. The parameters recommended by the committee are all reasonable.

This will be an acceptable test of DssKiln in the wild. Additionally, it may reassure MKR holders in an environment where significant immediate and annual dilution is being proposed through the End Game. 4 Polls Ending February 27, 2023 Declaration of Intent: Implement a Feature to Refund People Who Lost Money Sending DAI to the DAI Contract Address Summary: This proposal states that a feature should be implemented in the future to make whole users who mistakenly sent DAI to the token address. Recommendation: Vote Yes. GFX has long been an advocate of better protections for small holders, and are pleased to see this issue raised again. Note that a Declaration of Intent does not by itself commit Maker to any specific course of action. Amend MIP62 to Allow Changing Communication Responsibilities Summary: This amendment would 1) remove references to GovComms CU in the collateral offboarding communications process, as that CU is no longer active, and 2) allow for future substitutions under MIP62 provided the named party is unwilling or unable, and a willing member of the community is ready to assume those communication tasks. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This is simply common-sense cleanup of MIP62. Amend MIP41: Interim Facilitator Appointment Process Summary: This amendment would make various changes to improve the process to appoint interim facilitators. Examples include election by core unit vs by facilitator, since some CUs have multiple facilitators, and a path for a facilitator during a voluntary offboarding to appoint a single successor. Recommendation: Vote Yes. These changes are largely in response to edge cases identified during the recent CES-001 interim facilitator appointment. Most seem like obvious improvements to the process. MIP95: $100,000,000 of Cogent Bank Loan Participations Summary: This proposal would approve 100,000,000 DAI for loan participations alongside a portfolio originated by Cogent Bank. This deal is substantively the same structure and terms as the Huntingdon Valley Bancorp (which is in the process of being acquired by Citizens Financial Services, Inc.) Recommendation: Vote Yes. Generally, we are wary of MakerDAO approving new collaterals that touch the real world markets while the DAO is undergoing the intense levels of uncertainty and internal instability while responds to the End Game proposals. We also would like to see a shift towards Maker holding senior tranches of these portfolios, instead of participating pari passu on a 50/50 basis, and at lower levels than $100,000,000 while Maker\u2019s cash reserves are less than that amount. That being said, there are thousands of community banks in the United States. They represent a market that is hungry to access affordable capital from Maker, and can scale rapidly as a result, giving the DAO granularity and diversification in its combined underlying portfolio. Politically, a narrative of Main Street businesses and jobs being financed by DeFi is also deeply appealing. In the current environment, Maker needs friends, and helping community banks \u2013 which are often starved of capital readily available to larger, politically connected banking institutions \u2013 serve the needs of their local communities is one way to do that. It is, quite frankly, a way to make good by doing good. As a result, GFX votes Yes on this proposal, and hopes to see many more that are similar in the future \u2013 though we expect to see iterative improvements going forward, rather than copying the HVBC proposal, which was partly a proof of concept.

Recommendation: Vote No. If Spark Protocol is passed in March, then we do not expect this vote to be construed as opposition to the standard technical review, but do not support Spark receiving special prioritization or extraordinary resources. Engineering Resource For Phoenix Labs Summary: This poll seeks to clarify if MKR holders desire Protocol Engineering CU to divert 1 full-time engineer to work for Phoenix Labs/Spark Protocol. Recommendation: Vote No. Protocol Engineering has a backlog of work on Maker\u2019s multi-chain Teleport, as well as other responsibilities. Phoenix Labs should present a separate budget or increase its pending requests if it requires engineering resources. As per our usual policy, GFX Labs supported the current executive, which included parameter changes and Aave V2 D3M. ",

Increase the WBTC-C Stability Fee by 0.25% from 0.75% to 1%. Increase the YFI-A Stability Fee by 0.5% from 1% to 1.5%. Increase the RETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling by 10 million DAI from 10 million DAI to 20 million DAI. Increase the YFI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling by 1 million DAI from 3 million DAI to 4 million DAI. Increase the Compound v2 D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling by 40 million DAI from 30 million DAI to 70 million DAI. Increase the Aave v2 D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling by 15 million DAI from 5 million DAI to 20 million DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. Slowly raising rates and increasing debt ceilings is appropriate. In particular, we are very supportive of wstETH-B fee increases and higher exposure to the Compound and Aave D3Ms. NB to GovAlpha: GFX failed to vote in this poll, but this communication has still been provided.

Recommendation: Vote Yes. Support for this SPF should not necessarily be construed as support for launching Spark Protocol or utilizing Phoenix Labs. The cost, however, is low, and it seems likely the legal research will be relevant even without Spark Protocol. Decrease RETH-A Dust Parameter Summary: This proposal would decrease the dust parameter for RETH-A vaults from 15,000 DAI to 7,500 DAI. Recommendation: Vote Yes. This change is recommended by the Risk Core Unit, and would harmonize RETH-A\u2019s dust with similar vault classes. It was previously not included in reductions to other vault classes because RETH-A was newly live at the time. ",

We worry that using the ability in presented in this spell would be irreversible, and should not be implemented quickly. We are, however, willing to reconsider our position on this topic given more time to think about its consequences and the proposal comes through standard governance processes. ",

I\u2019m looking forward to the overall pace of activity moderating in the coming days so we can begin to think in more big-picture strategic terms. However, on balance I and my risk colleagues continue to believe the risk/reward of implementing this change now is highly favorable. Our general reasoning:  PSM Breaker is not quite analogous to end of Bretton Woods, as it is possible to deactivate just a single at-risk PSM while maintaining the DAI peg via the other PSMs (for example, over the weekend if we had the capability we could have deactivated just USDC, while leaving GUSD and USDP available to service DAI demand) Allowing continued minting via an at-risk PSM (as happened this weekend) can have the effect of making DAI free floating due to liquidity and solvency concerns, with a greater likelihood of DAI diverging from target price than if the PSM breaker is used promptly to address changing conditions Governance can remove this PSM breaker mechanism in the future if alternative risk mitigations are in place or if the risk/reward or voter preferences change  Just wanted to share our perspective here, but again we completely respect your decision on the matter and look forward to making further improvements and risk mitigations through a more deliberative governance process in the coming weeks.
