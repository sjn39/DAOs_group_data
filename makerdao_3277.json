                    "content": "Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain launched by Binance back in September 2020. BSC achieves ~3 second block times since it uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism which permits for better speeds and lower fees. In terms of technology, it doesn\u2019t offer the huge scalability and amazing features as Cardano or Ethereum 2.0 will do, but it solves one of the biggest issues which is stopping retail users of having access to DEFI: GAS fees in BSC are around $0.20 in average at the moment of writing. Since January, DEFI dapps in BSC started to lock a reasonable amount of value, and in a few days these have grown to levels comparable to the best of the DEFI dapps on Ethereum. Following the ranking on Dappsradar, 2 of these apps on BSC have scaled to be between the 10 with higher total value locked (TVL) on the DEFI space. Specifically:  Venus  Venus is an algorithmic money market which also creates a synthetic stablecoin VAI, which as imagined competes directly against DAI. You can borrow VAI directly against collateral, with a list of collaterals which includes Stablecoins (DAI, USDC, USDT), BTCB, ETH, XRP, DOT, FIL, BNB\u2026 as seen some of the top coins by market cap on the space. It also permits lending and borrowing similar to AAVE. At this moment the protocol has a TVL of $1.9billions!, and keeps growing (I\u2019ve been following it on the last days). They have emitted a total of 164millions VAI.  Pancakeswap  Another fork from Uniswap; it has grown at alarming pace in last weeks due to being on BSC. Swaping between several coins costs only 10 cents. At the moment they have a TVL of $920millions and growing at alarming pace  Autofarm  As we can imagine, both protocols above (and others new appearing in the chain) are incentivizing with their tokens which have seen an increase in value of 10x on last month alone. Autofarm is an automated yield farming platform, similar to Yearn and Harvest but running on BSC. With $500 million TVL and growing, it is one which could rivalize with the main one on Ethereum.  Serious competency for MakeDAO The sole fact of having very low GAS fees makes all these apps huge rivals for their counterpart on Ethereum blockchain. BSC as explained above is EVM compatible, in fact, the experience using these apps is similar with the difference of the extremely low GAS fees (paid in BNB) and very quick transactions (~5 secs wait time). Platforms like Harvest.finance have already started to make their move toward BSC. Given that BSC is fully compatible with EVM, it is a question of deploying the same solidity contracts over there. I\u2019m not sure how big of a job this could be, but we should seriously start thinking in a move like this. I got worried TBH when I saw Venus, their VAI, and how easy and cheap is to borrow there. The liquidity in BSC is growing in the billions already, and it could continue to grow parabolic if Ethereum GAS fees continue as they are (which we know they will, since solutions are still months or even years away). Wanted to share all this info with the community, and start a discussion on the topic, and the risks that MakerDAO could affront if we don\u2019t move at the speed of the competency in this area. I can see many other protocols moving toward BSC as quick as possible if the flow of money continues migrating toward the Binance Smart Chain ",

                    "content": "All valid points. I\u2019m aware of BSC whitepaper being heavily criticized when it was proposed last year. It was simply another clone of Ethereum. This above doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t gain traction specially with the boom of DEFI. It was placed online in the right moment (DEFI summer), and several projects started to be built over it. CREAM finance also run over it. Currently it has only 21 validators which definitely makes its decentralization questionable. My question for you is though: what would happen if suddenly we see half or more of DEFI TVL moving toward BSC, will we simply ignore it? Binance complete market cap will not support a crazy amount of value controlled there, with 4 billion assets already, that doesn\u2019t seem like Binance-controlled assets.     LongForWisdom:  this means there is little to no cost for them to fake transactions to make the network look busier than it is   I guess we cannot debate this one without proofs, but I was just checking that day the huge % on Pancakeswap statistics those sounded very strong like for suggesting false transactions, at least a lot of tokens where being swap there (meaning that they\u2019ll be giving 0.2% of all those transactions to the liquidity pool providers?, they\u2019ll have to control most of those pools themselves for this being of any profit, sounds hard to believe, but not impossible of course) I\u2019ll keep researching on the topic, and happy to go over any article shared here with any profound analysis of their centralization problems. But I wonder what would happen if we are slow to react\u2026 specially worried by the fact that MakerDAO is a platform for less than 90% of the common people (yes, less than that don\u2019t have 2k USD to open a Vault), and Ethereum GAS fees turns the flame of DEFI off for the commoner. I don\u2019t see those big institutions buying ETH and BTC in the DEFI game anytime soon (not yet), ratail \u201cinvestors\u201d are the main one out there IMO in this game. BSC is definitely offering them a different story\u2026 in fact, the story that the people want to hear, that\u2019s very dangerous! I definitely recommend to be careful here and keep a critical eye on what is going on at the moment there. ",

The biggest protocols in Ethereum - DEFI right now are working or in L2 solution, or expanding to other blockchains. I feel we\u2019re being too slow in this regard, and that\u2019s a huge risk for MakerDAO as a whole, for the complete ecosystem. I\u2019ll keep monitoring BSC and let you all know if I have stronger points to defend it, so far it has been a crazy month for it, similar to the DEFI summer on Ethereum back in late July: https://www.defistation.io/ If the tendency continues I think it\u2019ll be harder for us to simply ignore it. Respect to an L2 solution, I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re doing our best here sadly. I know that we have limited resources when it comes to workforce, but a reality is that we are collecting $60 millions annually in fees and we\u2019re burning it without bringing any positive price impact to MKR, grow there hasn\u2019t been exactly because of we burning it (in fact, seems to grow much more when we don\u2019t do it, odd). I would put out there 1 million DAI as a prize to any team who brings us an L2 implemented solution than continue pushing it further and putting all our ecosystem in risk from being forgotten for not adapting to the DEFI needs. Once again, I\u2019ll do my best to help MakerDAO in all what I can. And I\u2019ll keep sharing any relevant info that can be of our help, and propose solutions or ideas if I realize any. ",

But once liquidity grows, the question is: why do you need to bring those assets back to Ethereum? I\u2019ve seen more than one comment of people going to BSC and saying that they\u2019ll return to Ethereum once ETH 2.0 is out there. If any of these new chains gets similar level of liquidity than the TVL on DEFI projects, offering lower fees and faster transactions, they would have won the battle (which I know will put a lot of pressure in Ethereum developers to bring ETH 2.0 alive sooner, or ETH is going to suffer the consequences). Disclaimer: I\u2019m definitely enjoying low fees on BSC at the moment, and I\u2019m a DEFI gamer, playing there is 100x times more enjoyable just because of fees, no other reason, but that\u2019s a very strong one! But I know there are big risks, I would not move more than 10% my assets over there for sure, I like and trust Ethereum will get rid of this detriment caused by GAS fees\u2026 but the adoption of other chains could change mine and everybody here perception on those chains if things go for the worst on Ethereum.

We have turned our Vaults inaccessible for most of the retail investors. Setting the dust parameter in $2000 was a decision made uniquely due to the GAS issues on Ethereum. If we recommend those retail investors to use the Vaults in a cheaper to use chain, we could keep them within our system (plus we\u2019ll be contributing to the expansion of that chain which could be something positive for the space). I would not think that much in demand for DAI, as in Liquidity in that Chain and DEFI dapps\u2026  if there is a ton of assets to play with in the chain, it\u2019ll be already enough indication that we should facilitate the generation of DAI in that chain. We\u2019ll be solving 2 problems in one shot:  Keep retail investors Keeping up with the competency in a growing chain.  ",

The transaction fees in the pennies and dimes in lieu of tens even hundreds of dollars on ethereum have changed my view on bsc and other potential side chains/platforms Their exponential growth are reflected in their total value locked (tvl) per defistation.io. In my opinion, the reason that makerdao thrived the past year was due to lack of competition.  However as other chains have picked up steams and tvl, makerdao seems to slow to react due to the extreme high fees on the ethereum network at the moment. I love ether for its decentralized and want it to succeed, but its really expensive right now and over 90% of the potential users cant use ethereum network due to fees cost.  For normal folks they could care less about decentralized when its out of their reach.  Also nobody can said for a certain that eth will beat out all other platforms in the future, or become the next blockbuster or blackberry. Even with 1000x increase in tps are not going to support the whole ecosystem in the future.  Even if eth won out, there will still be other side chains/platforms to pick up the slack. The synergy of maker platforms across multiple platforms will bring other competective advantages to usd and euro dai. Therefore, i would like to propose makerdao should agressively invest and expand the maker protocol onto other chains/platforms.  An idea could be that Mkr tokens will own 100% of mkr protocol on ethereum network, and 40% of bsc mkr, cardano mkr, xdai mkr, dot mkr,  etc\u2026 The other 45% to be used for attracting yield farmimg and dai generation, and last 15% for team expenses. Eventually the 40% or so fee from other mkr protocols could greatly increase the mkr token burn rate and value. ",

We could see a situation where new and promising dapps have no choice but to try other platforms. Regarding solutions I trust Ren to build sufficient bridges between the most relevant chains over the next 18 months to enable DAI to be bridged over to chains that shows some traction. How exactly pegs would be maintained on other chains is more of an open question. The Maker community will however need to be on our toes, it would be tragic if some copy-paste team beat us to global success just because we would not move on from Ethereum at some point. ",

It is undeniable that Maker is not really suitable for small investors now. After all, we only have 21k+ vaults after 1 year+ of launching. This amount of vaults is really small, compared to what we have back in SAI where Coinbase on board a lot of CDP holders (it was around 200k of CDP IIRC). We are talking about so many different collaterals now, and yet only 21k+ vaults. I have accepted the fact that Maker vaults is not really for retail at the moment. Is that a big deal though? For now, retail investors can still buy and use DAI without owning a vault, they can still experience DeFi. I stand by with decentralization and I still believe in Maker. I believe the DAO in Maker is seeing the big picture. It is doing well even with just 20k+ vaults holders. And DAI is doing well as well. Perhaps in medium term (6 months down the road) some L2 solutions will appear and suitable for Maker to apply, by then we will have retail investors owning vaults. ",

                    "content": "I also think BSC does not follow the same ethos as MakerDAO. If MakerDAO were to launch on a side-chain, I would expect to only allowed bridged assets as backing. Ignoring Binances questionable centralization of nodes, the Binance-pegged assets are not secure. There is a case you can make that BUSD is no different from USDC if its held in a trusted bank account, but \u201cBinance-pegged ETH\u201d should NOT be considered collateral. I\u2019m not opposed to using side-chains though. xDai is a very promising platform which is launchable today, with a much better decentralization with their nodes. Matic/Polygon is launchable today as well. DOT will be usable in the near future. In the xDai world, 1hive is the DAO running Honeyswap. They have recently released Honeyswap on Matic/Polygon and are working on cross-chain swaps between the networks, and then creating a L2 rollup that supports both chains. Once that is done, the live Uniswap can be plugged in to their L2 solution (as Honeyswap is just Uniswap using the same LP tokens), making it a tri-chain cross-chain swappable platform with L2 rollups. I believe that type of approach is where MakerDAO should go. Don\u2019t focus on BSC, but instead launch on xDai, Matic/Polygon and BSC, but only allow tokens that originated from ETH as collateral (unless a chain has native tokens that the DAO votes it in). Collateral happens on-chain from only trusted tokens, and develop a L2 solution that allows DAI to be issued on any chain, using collateral only trusted from that chain. I would prioritize though a xDai or Matic/Polygon launch over a BSC launch. Similar to how 1hive is doing xDai + Matic/Polygon and THEN adding Eth support last once its plug-and-play, I think it would be best to use xDai and Matic/Polygon as the side-chain, build the L2 solution, and THEN decide if BSC is appropriate or not. EDIT: Or, include BSC from the start, but make the L2 solution let the DAO decide which directions issueing DAI works. For example, if you lock your ETH vault to use in L2, you can issue DAI / DAI on xDai / DAI on BSC, but if you have a BNC vault on the Binance chain and lock that for use in L2, give the DAO the ability to restrict DAI minting to only DAI on Binance if they choose. This extra lever of control would let us decide which DAI issued coins are allowed to be \u201cFungible\u201d with the other. It would let us discriminate and say \u201cETH/xDAI/Polygon vaults on L2 can issue each others DAI, but BSC vaults can only issue DAI on BSC\u201d. If BSC was to ever go down, we know DAI isn\u2019t polluted with BSC collateral and DAI will retain its full value. If BSC ever becomes truly decentralized in its nodes, the DAO can then choose to lift this restraint. ",

Have you read the recent announcement from Compound Finance, lending and borrowing assets from one chain to another, that sounds very very promising!

Governance       Following the brainstorm, now is the time to quantify what is our mission/vision for MakerDAO. I keep the objectives on the side for now.  Below is the description of each possible mission/vision for MakerDAO. Those are stereotypes, the reality is obviously more complex than a one-liner. If needed I can detail more some aspects. I can\u2019t change the poll after publishing, but if you come up with a new type of mission/vision, please put it in the comments for discussion.  Below, there are two polls\u2026     the message we should transmit is related to being the Money Lego of DEFI. As such, then we should focus I guess in making agreements with other protocols. ",

I would love that Blockchain solutions cover the needs of my friends in the Caribbean Island, who are not offered any option there at all, those are really really unbanked in every imaginable sense at this moment. But I don\u2019t think this is a problem only in this type of countries, I have many friends in whole Latam with similar problems, and even in European country this is a problem. Average wage in Poland and Portugal is under 1000eur/month, plenty of people here cannot dream of having 2000usd and less saying 5000usd for investing in DEFI even if they want to. Do they want to invest in DEFI?, yes they do!, I\u2019ve had big talks here with many friends who want to invest but doesn\u2019t count with a big capital, DEFI is really opening a door to many! And to those many, we\u2019re closing the doors in Maker (not saying that we do it on purpose, it is just a result of the current set up of the project). If this is a problem here, imagine in most countries of Latam, Africa we should simply forget about most of them, many there cannot afford even a few hundred of dollars. Most of Asian countries as well, Vietnam is out for sure! I was raised in a poor country (Cuba) with huge limitations and policies against any form of \u201ccapital accumulation\u201d (old soviet-socialist system), and maybe that\u2019s why I feel more identified with the needs of the class who cannot afford thousands to start their investment life. But they want to be able to be there as well!, that\u2019s what blockchain is about right?, decentralization!, similar opportunities for everyone! ",

I totally agree with you on providing access to All when it comes to DeFi products. But, perhaps the best approach is to provide access to DAI and not necessarily access to Vaults.I believe DeFi can provide services such as earning interest on your DAI with protocols like Yield, and Compound\u2013I would prefer to see the average Josefina and Jose convert their money into DAI (maybe EuDAI) and earn a stable Yield, then to have them take a loan out and get liquidated. Just my 2 gwei. Perhaps one day when we have met product-market fit and DeFi scales, we can have a platform built on top of Maker Vaults and offer micro-loans with a low dust parameter. Hey maybe you can build it? ",

Being the biggest concern of course the centralization and control Binance have over BSC. We got immediately another thread exploring launching on xDAI:     [Informal Poll] Why deploy on xdai? Governance       It is theoretically not more secure but the chance of losing money on xDAI due to theft/misbehaving bridges is very small and it can be somewhat mitigated. On the other hand, if you have a small vault on L1 (<$5.000) there are many ways you could lose money  - i.e. being liquidated at 0 bid (congestion), having to pay $1000+ to manage the vault or lose collateral (high fees)\u2026  EDIT: AFAIK - there were no incidents on xDAI causing people to lose money so far. $26M TVL.     I personally will keep using BSC because it is profitable (therefore enjoyable) for a DEFI-player, but I\u2019m already convinced that it is not good for MakerDAO. xDAI is a ways better option (but sadly it doesn\u2019t have enough liquidity). @LongForWisdom not sure if it is fine that I lock this thread?, I\u2019m happy with the community discussion on the topic so far, not sure if somebody else will have something else to say in this respect. Not sure if the correct way to proceed with these threads is for the creator to lock it once the discussion is considered concluded? Edit: I\u2019m not able to perform actions on the thread, like locking it. ",
