                    "content": "Hi Eth Magicians, wanted to discuss some thoughts I had regarding digital receipts on the blockchain and interested to hear what others think. Simple Summary: Using ERC-721/NFTs as a method of distributing digital receipts for physical purchases. Where the metadata represents an encrypted json receipt. Abstract: I\u2019d like to propose the idea of a transaction that flows as follows:  A customer purchases an item from an online retailer, where checking out leads the customer to payment through a smart contract, The smart contract verifys the amount transferred matches the order and provides the user with an standardized receipt NFT. When fulfilling the order, the retailer will upload the metadata to this nft which will be encrypted against the customers public key.  Motivation: If a customer purchases a physical item from an online retailer and uses a cryptocurrency to pay, the purchase will separately includes an invoice/receipt from the retailer that is emailed and/or physically   given to the customer. These receipts are critical for many reasons but digital receipts AFAIK have never gained traction. Instead we are left with PDFs and other analogue formats to represent transactions    that occurred digitally. Including an NFT as a receipt will provide a traceable and private link between the funds leaving the customers account and the digital receipt which may include important information such as serial numbers   and delivery tracking etc. This means that the customer can automate their record keeping with systems and understand exactly what has been purchased without a human having to provide copies of the receipts.  Metamask for example could show this full receipt when you click into an item in your transaction history. One of the major roadblocks to fully automating our current finance world is that businesses need to keep detailed records of our purchases and retailer systems distribute this detailed information outside of our transactional system (Printing a physical receipt, while separately processing payment through the EFTPOS machine). Requiring a human being to physically make the link between the two, usually by data     entry into the financial system. This is archaic and NFTs on the blockchain provide a method for this to be so much better. Outstanding thoughts:  A less interesting thought is that the amount in this encrypted receipt could be proven by the retailer using some zero knowledge proof, which could mean a blockchain could reject the transaction if this   receipt does not match the amount transferred. Voiding the transaction. A more interesting thought would be if the serial number encrypted in this receipt could be proven at a later time by the customer for use in warranty claims, maintenance requests, servicing etc.  Unsure if these are even possible, zero knowledge proofs are hard. Next Steps: If this has any sort of interest I could draft up the following standards for people to review:  Standard JSON format of the digital receipt Standard for the encryption of digital receipt to be put as metadata Standard for metadata of a NFT Receipt  ",

JSON is a great choice for data format, too. Human readable and standardized for efficient digital use. Here\u2019s some feedback to consider:   In Real Life (IRL) receipts are issued by the vendor, which make them more valid when used as evidence to third parties (e.g. taxes). If the receipt is issued by a smart contract upon receipt of payment, it loses that evidentiary quality because it only serves as proof of transferred funds. Was the item exchanged as well?   If the primary purpose of the NFT is the receipt, shouldn\u2019t we store the data in the image of the NFT (rather than in metadata)? Remember that the \u201cimage\u201d of an NFT doesn\u2019t need to be pixel data that translates into a visual picture. ERC-721 doesn\u2019t require that.   Encryption is clearly necessary to preserve privacy. Are there other privacy risks presented by common use of this? Wouldn\u2019t some be hesitant to reveal the link between their IRL persona and their pseudonymous on-chain account? Think about how IRL receipts don\u2019t include the full credit card number but only the last 4 digits.   These considerations are only about implementation details. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the first draft of this. ",

Thanks for the reply   I guess when I refer to a smart contract here I am also assuming the vendor is in control of the smart contract and the receipt would include some form of signature to prove that they indeed issued the receipt. I guess proof that the vendor indeed delivered the goods is another problem (Maybe solved by tracking information?).   I may have confused the term for metadata here. I thought I understood this but maybe not. But I guess if the URL in the token points to a JSON file (Stored on IPFS possibly) and structured like this:   {   \"version\": 3,   \"id\": \"07a9f767-93c5-4842-9afd-b3b083659f04\",   \"address\": \"aef8cad64d29fcc4ed07629b9e896ebc3160a8d0\",   \"Crypto\": {     \"ciphertext\": \"99d0e66c67941a08690e48222a58843ef2481e110969325db7ff5284cd3d3093\",     \"cipherparams\": { \"iv\": \"7d7fabf8dee2e77f0d7e3ff3b965fc23\" },     \"cipher\": \"aes-128-ctr\",     \"kdf\": \"scrypt\",     \"kdfparams\": {       \"dklen\": 32,       \"salt\": \"85ad073989d461c72358ccaea3551f7ecb8e672503cb05c2ee80cfb6b922f4d4\",       \"n\": 8192,       \"r\": 8,       \"p\": 1       },     \"mac\": \"06dcf1cc4bffe1616fafe94a2a7087fd79df444756bb17c93af588c3ab02a913\"   } }  And the cypher text decrypts to what our json receipt is.  Yeah there is definitely an element of privacy reduction in this, however I think a lot of it occurs simply by making the purchase. If you were analysing a wallet then knowledge that a transaction got a receipt (but not knowing the contents) is maybe only slightly more revealing than knowing they transferred to that business at all.  Appreciate the feedback, I might draft up an issue on the EIPS/ERC repos over the next few weeks to see what feedback I can get there. ",

I think what @DAYvid was suggesting is to use the metadata to generate an image with texts. Something like LOOT. Also I am not a big fan of storing things in the IPFS, especially if it is not a PFP collection that has limited supply. This can easily grow into a very large number of supply without a ceiling. In this case I think storing it on chain makes more sense. But then that brings to another question of how do we plan on storing a large json file on-chain in a graceful way. ",

                    "content": "So wouldn\u2019t mind getting this clarified, my understanding of ERC-721 is that it defines a minimum interface a smart contract must implement to allow unique tokens to be managed, owned, and traded. It does not mandate a standard for token metadata or restrict adding supplemental functions.  Where as ERC721Metadata is what actually ties the standard to an image and the **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-721 smart contracts So in my draft EIP i have mentioned under the backward compatibility section that This standard is an extension of ERC-721. It is not compatible with commonly used optional extensions (IERC721Metadata and IERC721Enumerable) mentioned in the EIP-721 standard.  Which I think would be enough to say that the digital receipt NFT could point at a tokenURI that contains JSON that doesn\u2019t comply with the IERC721Metadata extension. But I am not 100% sure on this. Would love some guidance here. That way the tokenURI points to a JSON file of our encrypted receipt, containing none of the normal NFT image fields. Alternatively I really like how loot have generated their image in the contract as a SVG containing all the text. So the image could be a printable representation of the JSON receipt. Which would be great. An SVG like this is way better than a PDF receipt. In regards to IPFS, I actually think the vendors would host their digital receipts on their own servers. This means there is a risk that the tokenURI would eventually point to a dead link, but its probably reasonable to expect the purchaser to back that receipt up somewhere safe. If your digital receipt is signed by the vendor then you have proof that its real, even if the original disappears ",

I know my own jurisdiction (Aus) well but seeing other countries requirements I immediately recognise that the structure needs some updating to be more flexible (variable number of taxes, additional purchase identification areas). I think something that will both a blessing and a curse in this area is that countries will be slow to accept these digital receipts to substantiate expense claims. So even if our structure contains all the correct fields, a tax office auditor may still reject the receipt and require alternative proof of purchase (at least initially). The opportunity that this brings would be that we don\u2019t need to be compliant with all jurisdictions initially, and can work on making them compliant incrementally. As long as our first version is at least useful (which would be providing enough information to the customers financial systems to categorise the expense) then we can add additional fields to a v2 or even a subversion v2.1 for specific jurisdictions. In saying that however, I have some ideas that should make the receipts more flexible and I want to add to the v1. So even if the structure isn\u2019t perfect, a business could still achieve compliance with workarounds if necessary. For example putting an unstructured \u201cextra\u201d field so you can display additional fields such as the FIK, BKP and PKP fields in that cz structure you linked. ",

Couldn\u2019t the retailer just send a signed receipt to the buyer over email or something?  The value of being on chain is the initial link between the transaction and the receipt. A financial system monitoring a wallet sees a transaction for 10 eth which includes the nft receipt also saying 10 eth can be certain that transaction is represented by that receipt. It\u2019s also an easy convenient place to store your receipts, even if you aren\u2019t actively tracking them. You can come directly to the transaction if you need to review the receipt. A good alternative would be a retailer emailing a json receipt and a financial system capable of retrieving the email and matching that to a transaction. Although less convenient to go back through emails to find the receipt if you aren\u2019t running a system, this would be sufficient if it existed. Unfortunately the world has decided that PDFs via email is the easiest method here and parsing the pdf is actually the roadblock preventing progress. Because the retailers need to comply with tax regulations for evidence of purchase it needs to be the tax offices that lead the standardisation of the digital structure to take this pathway. Unfortunately they have shown no initiative to do so despite having decades of opportunity. I actually expect if we get some traction for digital receipts in the cryptocurrency world that will start the fire that forces the old financial system to also standardise their local jurisdictions in a digital format. And we can update our standard to directly copy that if they eventually do.  Hm, so what differentiates that from copying the signed transaction adding the metadata? (I\u2019m mostly playing devil\u2019s advocate here, I do see the value.)  This actually is interesting to explore, from the customers perspective there is no difference. The receipts purpose is simply to clarify the details, and the certainty that the receipts contents are true comes from directly experiencing the transaction. A third party needing to verify the transaction however cannot rely on an unverified statement, so the receipt contents need to be signed by any retailer to meet their evidence requirements. My thoughts are that we require the receipt contain the https url of the retailer, and their ssl certificate is used to sign the contents of the receipt. That way a third party can have 100% certainty of the receipt contents (and the customer isn\u2019t trying to hide an alcohol purchase with a fake receipt).  So I\u2019m imagining a scenario where a retailer uploads an invalid signature, and the buyer doesn\u2019t check the signature until much later (say during a dispute.) Since the transaction signature is valid, but the contract doesn\u2019t check the embedded signature, you can get a disagreement about what is correct.  Yeah this would be possible, this is why it would be prudent to check the receipt signature is correct. But I don\u2019t think we should enforce it here in this system, instead allow the customers to complain to the retailer, saying their receipts are incorrect and allowing the retailer to upload an amended and corrected receipt at a later date. A business customer running a formal financial system that would likely be the place to check. Non business customers rely on the retailer satisfying its business customer needs who will complain. I don\u2019t think there is too high of a risk from retailers intentionally creating false receipts, there isn\u2019t much to gain. And if we allow the metadata to change when mistakes/errors occur then it addresses the more common reason for incorrect signatures ",

It\u2019s like maybe you could use the NFT in another smart contract, but Nicks suggestion that the receipt should contain a field to link to another NFT (or serial number) makes more sense for that too.

                    "content": "So I have been sending messages to people who have reached out and shown interest in this EIP so far and have been discussing their thoughts on whether this digital receipt format should stay  as an NFT or whether changing to an event would be better for their purposes. The conclusion I have reached is that it should stay as an NFT even if this means more on chain data and gas. The reasons I have collected so far are as follows:  Simplicity: NFTs are well understood by the community and end users. When discussing the idea of a digital receipt as an NFT almost everyone immediately recognises how the transaction leads to an NFT and this NFT leads to some data. Although the usage of an event would contain a similar workflow this is not something many users have done before and most reactions I\u2019ve had to using an event are whether its even possible (It definitely is, but the workflow for how this would work is foreign most users). Versatility: When suggesting a receipt as an NFT people appear excited about the ideas of what can be built on top of this. Things like warranty claims and review websites have been suggested to me where a smart contract can check if you own the NFT. I believe a lot of these are still possible using events, but would be more difficult cause you would need to analyse blocks to see if it the receipt exists for this person. Consistency: Ethereum as a whole uses tokens to do things, almost all of the things that have been built are done by moving tokens around. An NFT receipt is consistent with how ethereum end users do things. This is contrasted to events which are typically used by devs when doing tests and by analysts looking over the blockchain. End users don\u2019t usually touch events so to make them follow an event here would be inconsistent. Gas: The primary argument for events is that it would save on gas. Obviously the current proposal on L1 would be too expensive, even right now when gas prices are quite low the price of $2- $5 for a receipt is unfeasible. So L2s are almost immediately a requirement for this proposal where gas prices and block space is cheap enough for this to exist. So optimising this proposal for Gas I believe would be incorrect here.  Overall the tradeoff here is to save gas vs usability for users and I don\u2019t believe the savings in gas justify the increase in difficulty for end users. So I have kept the structure as an NFT rather than adjusting to an event and keeping it entirely off chain. ",

But I am now convinced that this is definitely a unique and useful idea. Not only could this serve as a receipt and warranty, it could also serve as a maintenance record, recall system and much more. Kudos on your hard work with this, I am in hopes that it will be implemented. I feel it would not be the proper method for some items, with a price say < $300 or some amount. That could even be a choice made by the purchaser. It those cases the emitted event method could be more useful and save on gas. One last thought would be an additional field for a purchase order number when used in a business setting and/or a comment field. ",
