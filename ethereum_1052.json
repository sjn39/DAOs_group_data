Unless someone has a financial interest in the decision, the whole thing is very exhausting at this point. Polls about this where people have to go out of their way to expend effort (like burning ETH) are going to bias toward those who have the strongest incentive to lobby for a given outcome. If we are going to try to gauge community sentiment, I think the best way is to randomly sample a subset of the community and then try very hard to get responses from as many from that sample as possible.

I have been mining Ethereum for almost 4 years now. I have invested $$$ of dollars into supporting Ethereum security using GPUs. Like you I care deeply about the project and am looking forward to POS. Like you my company is accountable for paying salaries and ensuring we stay profitable. However unlike you, I have been at a business disadvantage for the last two years. You see I started this business years ago with a well defined business model based on the Ethereum yellow paper that claimed it would be ASIC resistant. Coming from Bitcoin I understood how ASICs can affect GPU business models. However I was willing to invest a huge amount of money and trust that Ethereum would do everything in its power to ensure it stayed ASIC free in accordance with it\u2019s yellow paper. I was mining Ethereum 3 years before your company even existed. For the past two years my business has been going through major challenges as we have been struggling to stay profitable. It was not always like this. We prefer to HODL every coin we mine to build for the future. However due to the inability to compete with ASICs we have been selling the majority of coins we have mined just to cover expenses. Miners like me who have been loyal to Ethereum and have been here since the beginning are beginning to think the Johnny come latelies DAPS are trying to force the old timers into letting go of our holdings in Ethereum at what we all know are extremely low prices. It is pretty simple, ASIC miners dont have the long term holdings we have. Like you they have only been in Ethereum a relatively short time. Squeezing the GPU miners like this the last two years has resulted in us having to sell deeply locked up coins. What is the hardest part about all of this is the development community that we have trusted the last 4 years does not see this as urgent as we do. While the DAPS are busy squeezing the miners ASICs are taking control of Ethereum security. Understand these ASIC farms are 95% in China. Understand these ASICs are pro Bitcoin and not Ethereum. Forcing the old time miners to liquidate their holdings just to survive could prove to be a double edged sword if you get our coins but the network is unable to function as it gets closer to POS. ",

So you had no real skin in the game until 2019 when you joined a DAAP project. We were here long before you were risking everything. So did you read the yellow paper before you joined your DAAP team? I would expect you would. Why would you take on a project prepared to go against what was written in the founding document of Ethereum. This is like becoming a member of Christian church with intentions of converting the members to Muslim. It is immoral and wrong. Please go to another coin that does not state in their yellow paper that ASICs are a \u201cplague\u201d Your company is benefitting from the yellowpaper far more than you understand. When  Ethereum was created it looked to move past the oppressive nature of large ASIC mining companies controlling development work of Bitcoin. A lot of developers came to Ethereum for this alone. What you and the rest of the DAAPS opposing Etherum ASIC fork is doing is the same. You are trying to use your albeit limited power to control the dev team from implementing what was called for in its founding documentation. Please move to a different coin instead of trying to change the one that you joined knowing full well what its core values were. I tell you what. Let\u2019s see how patient you are. What if the miners stipulated that for the next 2 years no development work would be done except that which sought to make Ethereum as ASIC proof as possible. What if this cost you 40% of your revenue. How long would your company survive and how patient would you be. Ridiculous I know, but that is exactly what has happened in reverse the last 2 years for GPU miners. We have been waiting patiently for opportunities when the dev team reaches milestones to bring the ASIC issue up for discussion. Up until recently there was NO  community objections to a fork to remove ASICs. It is now only with the new DAAP companies coming on board that they think their EIPs take precedence over ours. This is  not the Ethereum community we have known the last 4 years. You and your inability to allow others in the community to survive are a cancer to the Ethereum community as a whole. It is not just all about you. We have waited patiently for 2 years yet you refuse to wait 3 weeks after the next fork to remove ASICs. ",

They have adopted KawPOW (their version of ProgPOW) without any security issues two days ago.

I really really can\u2019t understand why someone who is not an ASIC manufacturer would ever support ASICs. Is it because they can somehow \u2018beat\u2019 the game and get an ASIC that no one else gets? Seriously are people that naive? IDC about prog pow. What I care about is making it so that the playing field is fair, and openly understood. This is only possible with GPUs. Additionally, no regular people use Ethereum anymore. The grandma and grandpa buy bitcoin. And the gamer mines monero. Ethereum is dying (20% loss to BTC over the year). Ethereum has every reason to grow and succeed and destroy bitcoin. It has the momentum, but because of bad governance particularly around ASIC resistance it is actually losing. 20% might not sound like a lot, but it only takes a few years like that and this thing is bigger shit coin Truthfully, I have no problem with people making money. But unless you\u2019re actually the asic manufacturer you\u2019re going to lose big. ProgPOW drives me nuts because it isn\u2019t even like a confusing thing. It\u2019s literally the world vs the asic manufacturers. Yet there are so many people who have been convinced to support ASICs. Truly stuff like this makes me think Ethereum will never make it. ",

                    "content": "I agree 100%. Althouh my main argument for Ethereum is based on network security, it is amazing how the majority of the devs live in a world where they accept the current abysmal Bitcoin dominance of 0.02 ETH/BTC. Because devs focus solely on development and security, game theory gets pushed into the background. The increase in Bitcoin dominance as shown by the reduction in ETH/BTC exhange rate is directly correlated to the rising number of Chinese ASIC farmers on the Ethereum network. What a different world we would now be in had the dev team decided two years ago that keeping ASICs off were the number one priority. This is when ETH/BTC exchange rate was well over 0.1. With the huge progress made by the developers in moving to POS, they have seen no increases in value, only continual reduction in valution. BTC is down 50% from its 20K highs. Ethereum would be at 700 if it had only maintained its relative dominance. We all know Ethereum is superior to BTC, so ask yourself why is this not reflected in the markets? Could it be Ethereum is in a battle with the top dog BTC that is currently mined by over 60% in China? Could it be that Chinese ASIC suppliers will dump ETH for BTC to ensure that dominance remains? If you are are a dev please make a change to remove ASICs from your network. You deserve to be rewarded for the amazing progress you are making. Albeit not directly since most are not direct holders of Ethereum. However the Euphoria and energy that comes with gaining ground on BTC is a very positive force. Think back to two years ago and remember how that felt. You can have it once again. Remove ASICs and stop the bleeding. ",

                    "content": "Thank you sir. So if I could take this one step further. If the premise is true, that ASICs are being used to dilute the value of Ethereum to prevent it from overtaking Bitcoin; could not we argue that this is also a security risk and in need of dev attention? As we know there are other security risks in crypto besides a 51% attack. A large attacker does not need to attack the network if their end goal is sell ETH for BTC. They can achieve their goal by slowly siphoning off the GPU miners and gaining higher rewards. Once the ASICs reach a tipping point of over 50% I would expect it to cascade faster and faster as more coins are sold for BTC and GPU miners leave due to low profitability. Of course this is speculation on my part. But isn\u2019t security something we do in anticipation of what an attacker might do? If network security waits for the attacker to reveal their plot, they will surely lose the battle no matter how amazing their technology is. ",

                    "content": "Finally lets explore the true reason the Defi DAPPS don\u2019t want to remove ASICs. Their main goal is to accumulate as much Ethereum at what will be historically low valuations. They fully understand the difference between distributed GPU HODLR mining versus centalized Chinese mining dumping ETH for BTC. As the ASIC miners sell ETH for BTC, BTC value rises increasing their main operations value. The constant development work on Ethereum helps hold the value up so they can continue to dump Ethereum. The DAPPS are very much enjoying this time as they can fill their bags as both GPU and ASIC miners are dumping ETH, but for different reasons. GPU miners are being forced to sell to cover costs and Chinese ASIC miners who control over 65% of BTC hash sell ETH for BTC as a way of increasing the value of their main BTC operations. The DAPPS are playing russian roulette with the ASIC miners though. They know full well of the security risks in allowing centralized mining to take over a coin that will need fork concensus to switch to POS which will result in their removal someday. They however justify this risk with greed of they themselves becoming the controlling HODLRs of ETH once POS is completed and the immense selling pressure of POW miners is removed. If successful the DAPPS, turning a blind eye to ASICS, will have swindled miners out of millions of coins sold so cheap in the early POW mining days of Ethereum. If not challenged this will be the history of the early POW days of Ethereum and how the devs did nothing and did not honor their own words in the yellow founding paper, that \u201cASICS are a plague\u201d and remove them. How the founding miners were forced to sell their early mined coins so cheap to cover costs and losing the battle to cheaper ASICS. Is this what we want history to show for Ethereum? Finally if I am correct about BTC ASIC miners mining ETH for BTC also, there is a way to determine if this is true. Post BTC halving, if you are selling ETH for BTC it is now 50% more profitable to build ETH ASIC miners than it was last week pre halving. All things being equal (ETH price, no reduction in ETH rewards) I would expect to see large increases soon in ETH hash rate as more ASICs are brought online to sell for BTC which is now harder to mine. This also would imply the 0.02 ETH/BTC exchange rate will go much much lower. Possibly by 50%. ",
