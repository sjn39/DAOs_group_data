We need to obtain trusted public certificates (e.g., national identity cards and/or ePassports, resident permits, driving licenses and eSIM, etc.) from a centralized party like governments and financial institutions or corporations as an original identity certificate, from this source ID, to derivate a federated identity architecture to allow implementing zero-knowledge proof of identity in order to access a real trustless and permissionless blockchains to build trust from anonymous.

On this part maybe the author  @yuliu-debond  can give more precise response. but in my understanding, it will be based on the minter of the SBT(that will be first onboarding the KYC identity of the wallet holder as shown in diagram link before). KYC can have a lot of composable elements, especially when looking at the breadth of VC standards. This appears to be a simpler, cut down verification mechanism. Perhaps the name of the EIP should be more generic, but have KYC as a potential use case?  This is indeed you are correct, and indeed we have changed the name of the EIP to On-Chain Verifiable Credentials, thanks for the reminder and we will do the updating here also. Is there a demo of this you can link to?  We are currently building a non custodial wallet, this will be launched most probably till Q1/Q2  2023. ",
