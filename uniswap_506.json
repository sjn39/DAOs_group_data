Something to help get people to stay longer and explore more. I would also like to see more merchandise! Uni has a lot going for it with the hot pink and unicorn. Would be a great way to get the word out to the general public. Many other tokens have t-shirts coffee mugs ect. It helps bring awareness to the platform and helps with conversations. Both of these would help draw more users in, helping them to stay longer, and explore more. Just my thoughts. ",
