                    "content": " Context Engagement has gradually become an essential part of the Delegates\u2019 responsibilities in MakerDAO ecosystem. Participating daily in our community discussions takes time and increases costs for Delegates. Recognized delegates are compensated for the quantity and quality of their engagements on the MakerDAO forum as judged by the rest of the community via the SourceCred mechanism. In addition, Delegates\u2019 active participation with the community and each other generates a more robust discussion and greater community engagement. This undoubtedly leads to a better decision-making process for the protocol.  Motivation Delegates\u2019 exclusion from payouts under main SourceCred instance could interrupt this virtuous process. If the protocol continues compensating Recognized Delegates for their active engagement they will continue to be incentivized to participate in the discussion regularly in order to receive their compensation. GovAlpha continues researching for the best alternative but in the meantime, we believe it is important to maintain off-chain incentives for a growing group of actors that play an increasingly strategic role within our ecosystem. This post aims to present a new Delegate SourceCred reward mechanism with which GovAlpha Core Unit will assess and reward the engagement and community participation of Recognized Delegates within our community.  Delegates SourCred Compensation  Cred Distribution The reasonings behind Delegates\u2019 exclusion from payouts under the main Source Cred instance has been extensively explained and justified in the SourceCred Report, however, GovAlpha will continue using the Cred distribution across Recognized Delegates to assess their engagement. The imbalances detected in the past had more to do with the contributors\u2019 differences than with an algorithm design problem. To mitigate the effects generated by these differences, GovAlpha has designed two changes.   A separate Delegate SourceCred fund is created to compensate Recognized Delegate engagement.   Rewards are distributed outside of the existing SourceCred instance and through a new distribution formula.   Separating the delegate and community engagement budgets prevents Recognized Delegates from monopolizing the DAI distribution and allows us to maintain the dispersion and decentralization of the benefits that SourceCred offers to the community. 52,000 DAI annually will be allocated to the Recognized Delegate reward pool. This breaks down to 4,000 DAI total distributed to delegates per month based on their engagement in the MakerDAO forum. In 5-week months, the monthly amount to be distributed will be 5,000 DAI.  Cred Calculation Cred for delegates is calculated using a custom algorithm based on raw weekly cred scores. This algorithm assesses the activity of the Delegates on a weekly basis, measuring cred earned from likes received, topic-post interactions, and post-reply interactions on the posts they have created during that week. This is performed in a three-step process:   First, the algorithm selects the week evaluated for a specific delegate.   Then, it filters out all of the actions that are not relevant for the scope of this calculation (user mentions, inter-week cred interactions, and cred lost for likes given).   Finally, it counts and stores the cred that\u2019s left in the selection.   This makes the calculation more biased toward direct delegate activity and recent quality contributions, so Delegates that contribute less (garner fewer likes, replies, and link-backs) will notice that the DAI they receive from SourceCred will be significantly reduced.  Payout Process Engagement compensation in DAI is calculated on a weekly basis and paid out to Recognized Delegates once a month. The weekly calculation adjusts activity parameters to reward the most recent contributions maximizing incentives for continuous and consistent engagement. For clarification and transparency compensation calculations are public and located here: GovAlpha Observable. Finally, at the end of each month, payouts will be distributed by GovAlpha from the GovAlpha multisig wallet.  General Eligibility Any Recognized Delegate with one or more official forum accounts is eligible to receive delegate engagement payouts for one account only. Recognized Delegates must opt-in and confirm which forum account is accruing engagement payouts.  Monthly Eligibility A Recognized Delegate is only eligible for engagement payouts in a given month if they meet the criteria in MIP61 to receive a non-zero amount of compensation for that month.  Exclusions GovAlpha Facilitators may exclude any Recognized Delegate from engagement payouts at any time, for any reason. GovAlpha Facilitators must communicate a reason publicly if a given Recognized Delegate is being excluded from off-chain proposal bounty payouts.  Budgetary Impact The Delegate SourceCred won\u2019t require any extra budget expenditure. It will be financed with 20% of the resources currently allocated to SourceCred contributions funding. This is part of a budgetary diversification strategy for the year 2022 where GovAlpha will try to allocate monetary incentives more efficiently in different complementary initiatives to improve the management of incentives and at the same time take care of DAO resources.  Communication Delegates\u2019 engagement performance will be published in each month\u2019s Delegates Round-up along with an overview of their activity within Maker Governance.  Next Steps GovAlpha is aiming to start implementing the new Delegate SourceCred in June. CC: @Recognized-Delegates ",

Yes, it also applies to the community Sourcecred instance. Essentially it\u2019s a protection against anyone trying to game the system e.g. a CU member setting up a sockpuppet to try and get sourcecred payouts.  Note the entry in the Operational Manual makes it clear that we must also provide a public reason when excluding a user from Sourcecred. Similarly, we are able to ban people from discord and the forum etc, as well as having sole permissions to post polls to the voting portal. One could argue those powers aren\u2019t decentralized either. However, as you know, GovAlpha takes our responsibilities very seriously. I would encourage any community member that thinks these powers are being abused to consider whether we retain the ability to carry out our mandate.  GovAlpha Mandate to Make Changes to Sourcecred     flipflopflapdelegate:  I did receive a DM from a community member asking me how, why, and when GovAlpha decide to make decisions on how SourceCred should be distributed without MKR token owners approval of such decision.   Thank you for raising concerns from the community. I will refer you to our most recent budget which states the following re: sourcecred and off-chain incentives:  MakerDAO currently uses SourceCred to reward engagement in the official forum. We will investigate and trial alternative configurations of SourceCred, and non-SourceCred initiatives in an attempt to achieve the goals of:  Retaining interested community members by providing \u2018bridging\u2019 compensation that makes engagement worth the cost in the hope that members will take up a more formal role in MakerDAO. Increasing the number of relevant and useful MIP and signal request submissions.   Also note that there is not a specific sourcecred line in the budget but a line item for \u201cGovernance Incentives\u201d which Sourcecred falls under. This budget was unanimously approved by MKR voters which we believe gives us sufficient mandate to make these changes given there is no other governance process directing Sourcecred (such as a MIP).  Impacts on the Community GovAlpha has previously written about issues with sourcecred here and concerns have also been raised by the community here. Anecdotally, we have also been contacted privately by former active community members expressing surprise that they are still receiving sourcecred payouts. These changes have been carefully weighted to minimize any reduction in payouts to community members. There are 2 groups that will see reduced payouts:  People already paid by MakerDAO (facilitators, CU members, Recognized Delegates [although there is a separate Recognized Delegate instance]). People who are no longer actively participating in governance (contributions 4 months or longer ago will effectively no longer count).  Those community members who do not fall into either of these two groups should see minimal reduction, or even an increase in their sourcecred payout, as well as being eligible for the new off-chain proposal bounties. This is because as things stand sourcecred payouts are dominated by CU members and Recognized Delegates - if you look at \u201cThis Month\u201d in the sourcecred explorer you can see that of the top 10 cred earners, only 2 (rune and Meeoh) are not CU members, facilitators or delegates.  cred715\u00d7835 24.5 KB  Also, note that you and I account for nearly 9% of the total payout for this month of 20,000 DAI, I will no longer be eligible and you will be moved to the delegate instance, freeing up that 9% for other eligible community members. So, while the headline figure allocated to sourcecred is reducing, the remaining individuals who are eligible will be entitled to a larger portion of the sourcecred payouts, hence why we expect their allocations to increase or remain the same, provided they are still actively engaging in the forum.
