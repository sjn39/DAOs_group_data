See Compliance Assistance Release No. 2022-01 | U.S. Department of Labor (dol.gov) It seems the DOL has become aware of financial services companies marketing crypto investments as retirement-plan options recently and \u201chas serious concerns.\u201d DOL said crypto investments present \u201csignificant risks and challenges\u201d to 401(k) investors, including fraud, theft, and financial loss. Without getting into the sum and substance of each aspect (which can be found in the DOL release), DOL cites to the following reasons as to support its position:  speculative and volatile investments; 2) the challenge for plan participants to make informed investment decisions; 3) custodial and recordkeeping concerns; 4) valuation concerns; and 5) an evolving regulatory environment  We shall see how it all plays out.
