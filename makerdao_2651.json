Declaration to Replace: n/a  Specification Context and Motivation As the MKR protocol evolves and new collateral is added to the collateral portfolio, there is a direct need to diversify away from on-chain crypto assets and bring in uncorrelated \u201cReal World Assets\u201d (especially collateral that is backed with credit quality). Furthermore, in addition to bringing stability, an economically motivated independent real world party and sound legal structure will add liquidity to the DAI ecosystem helping to tame the DAI price and use market forces to pull it towards its reference currency, the US Dollar. In doing so, a series of legal structures will be used to secure protections for MakerDAO to allow the lending of DAI to LendCo (an off-chain asset backed lender). This DAI will be converted to USD, and the USD, along with equity that LendCo has and will continue to raise, will then be used by LendCo to provide secured loans to willing Borrowers (\u201cBorrowCo\u201d). Declaration MakerDAO desires to engage 6s, as an off-chain asset backed lender, to cause the addition of a new collateral type (real world assets) along with new roles that would need to be filled from a person(s) / entity nominated by MKR holders. As an off-chain asset-backed lender, 6s would then engage the MKR community in a compliant way to execute a revolving credit facility loan agreement to help bring DAI loans to the \u201creal world,\u201d complementing the business operations of 6s. 6s would then fundamentally put a revolving credit facility loan agreement inside a trust for the benefit of MakerDAO. As a result, MakerDAO will need to create a new role (or expand the roles of others) of a \u201cMaker Representative(s)\u201d as a person and/or legal entity that will be authorized to sign the legal documents necessary to set up the real world side of the transaction including, sponsoring the trust and engaging the regulated Trust Company that will serve as trustee of the trust. Please see the rest of this document for all supporting documentation, reference links, and associated historical posts. Supporting Materials   Introduction to 6s   How is this different?   The Maker Representative   The Legal Structure + Compliance   Core Operative Documents   Oracles   Liquidations   Capital Flow   Real World Asset module   Why is this important?   Time Horizon   Legal Structure Selection   6s Capital LLC (\u201c6s\u201d) / Maker Community (\u201cMKR\u201d)   Matthew Rabinowitz\u2019s Bio   Projects First in Line   General Next Steps   Introduction to 6s 6s Capital LLC & 6s Capital Partners LLC (together \u201c6s\u201d), Delaware USA, along with any future international tax optimized feeder structures 6s works with multiple commercial real estate developers throughout the United States. Those developers build buildings that include a long-term lease. 6s provides secured loans equal to 100% Loan-to-Cost for construction and the underlying real estate acquisition until completion. Those buildings are customized (build-to-suits) and ground leases for Credit Tenant Leases. Specifically: Real-Estate \u2014Commercial -----Credit Tenant Lease -------Single-Tenant Net Lease Construction Time Lapse for an already-completed project - Sample 6s was born during the COVID-19 banking credit squeeze when its sister company, 6s Development LLC, had challenges with banks no longer wanting to provide credit. The principals of 6s Development LLC have been doing Credit Tenant Lease development for 15 years and have built well over a thousand locations. 6s Capital LLC aims to permanently replace and ensure a future is built on a financial foundation of rock, not sand. None of the locations built by 6s Development have defaulted. How is this different? MakerDAO as a credit facility fundamentally provides credit in exchange for risk-adjusted ability to foreclose on assets used as collateral. In this context, MakerDAO would be bringing on \u201cReal World Assets\u201d as collateral, and in doing so, how liquidations would be caused/triggered needs to be adopted for this context. In the real world, a digital oracle to automate the decision of whether a \u201cbreach\u201d has occurred that would then trigger a liquidation will not work. 6s and MKR governance* first must agree on the type of real world events that would trigger a liquidation of a loan to 6s. The most common would be a breach of a covenant by 6s. A digital oracle cannot walk into a court of law and file a breach of contract claim or a foreclosure claim against 6s. Only a \u201cperson\u201d with standing to sue in Court can do that. MakerDAO and 6s can agree on the obligations/requirements/covenants and memorialize those terms in a vote, but those same agreed terms must next be memorialized in a written credit facility agreement that is signed by a real \u201cperson\u201d to be enforced by law in the real world. (as opposed to purely numeric with a pricing oracle) or code. Note: As MKR Governance itself cannot execute a legal document, MKR Governance will need to appoint and nominate one (or more) \u201cMaker Representatives\u201d (natural persons or legal entity). The \u201cMaker Representatives\u201d will first sign the written agreements necessary to execute the understanding between 6s and MakerDAO and will require approval by a vote of MakerDAO governance members. This same authorized Maker Representative will be expected to carry out duties assigned to it by MakerDAO itself. For example, one responsibility will be to set up the trust and hire the trustee, which will require signed physical written agreements. Another duty will be informing the trustee what MakerDAO expects the trustee to do. Another duty might be to review the reporting/reports from 6s or the trustee of the trust to attest to the community whether or not 6s remains in compliance with the revolving credit facility agreement. Other duties will be general real world administrative matters that cannot be decentralized or automated on a blockchain. This representative will be an indemnified role. The Maker Representative \u2022 Appointed by MakerDAO \u2022 Given specific written authority by MakerDAO to take only particular actions approved by MakerDAO \u2022 Sign real world legal documents on behalf of MakerDao as needed to carry out the will of MakerDao in the real world with respect to the DAI being lent and the approved real world collateral being received \u2022 Represent the will and the rights of MakerDAO \u2022 Sponsor the formation of the Trust for the benefit of MakerDAO \u2022 Engage and instruct the Trust Company to be the Trustee of the Trust \u2022 Instruct the Trustee to execute the revolving credit facility agreement and other documents between the trust and LendCo in accordance with the authority approved by MakerDAO \u2022 Oversee movement for DAI from MakerDAO to the Trust (through a series of steps) \u2022 Oversee exchange of DAI to USD \u2022 Oversee Trustee actions \u2022 Review reports from 6s and/or trust and attest to the revolving credit facility agreement\u2019s compliance by 6s and compliance of the trust agreement by the trustee to the MKR community. \u2022 If also a legal entity, the Maker Representative Entity (\u201cMRE\u201d) and the TFE could be the same. Further, it is the TFE that will provide the actual DAI to the Trust. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement, 6s and MKR governance would agree on a set of reporting requirements that 6s would be required to deliver to a Maker Representative quarterly (with some spot inspection rights). Should 6s be in breach of the agreement, and all cure periods have expired, the Maker Representative would report this information to MakerDAO. After that, MakerDAO would and should liquidate the vault and instruct the Maker Representative to notify the Trustee to commence real world liquidation on 6s loans (which would then wind-down the affairs of 6s and sell any remaining assets). All USD proceeds would then be delivered to the Trust to repay the loan of 6s; the trustee would convert the USD to DAI and return the DAI to MakerDAO. The Legal Structure + Compliance Compliance includes, but is not limited to:  Annual audited financial statements of 6s Quarterly Independently reviewed financial statements List of all outstanding loans  In construction Performing Non-performing Equity Requirement Reports per loan    The Maker Representative\u2019s role will be to report on compliance of 6s and execute the operative documents between 6s and MKR holders. However, MakerDAO could decide to assign other duties to the Maker Representative. Further, and subject to MKR consent, a legal entity is also recommended to hold a Maker Representative role, which may also be the Tax Favorable Entity (\u201cTFE\u201d), providing the DAI loan proceeds to the Trust, thus consolidating the two. Subject to legal & tax requirements, verification, and MKR discussion, a Cayman Islands legal entity may be recommended.  https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FINAL%20US%20-%20Cayman%20Islands%20-%20Cayman%20alternat.pdf Withholding exemptions to cross border interest payments. - Wagner Duys and Wood  Regardless of the jurisdiction, that Maker Representative Entity (\u201cMRE\u201d) would be the party authorized by MakerDAO to sponsor of the Trust and cause its formation and engagement with the Trustee, a regulated Trust Company. This Maker Representative Entity shall also serve as an administrative role (e.g., paying bills/questions about MKR governance, etc.). To clearly define the MRE role, MakerDAO should assign the MRE duties and approve them in the vote. Thus, all parties (6s, MakerDAO, the trustee, auditor, etc.) know precisely what the MRE can and cannot do on behalf of MakerDAO. Also, the trust agreement will include provisions stating that:  Underlying trust agreement cannot be changed without a vote from MakerDAO community with notice of the vote delivered to the trustee Underlying trust agreement cannot cause a liquidation without getting direction from the MakerDAO from etherscan.io or vote.MakerDAO.com  Underlying trust agreement allows that an MKR vote (vote.MakerDAO.com) can replace the MRE at its sole discretion and will notify the trustee of this change.  As contemplated, the Trust should have minimal taxation as the TFE / Maker Representative Entity would receive the taxable interest income. After the final jurisdiction of the TFE is determined, someone / some group in the community, in collaboration with Matthew Rabinowitz and with local counsel, will form the entity (or cause it to be created). The TFE will explicitly not be run / owned / affiliated with LendCo or its officers.

However, the revolving credit facility agreement will have data reporting requirements maintained to remain in compliance and keep MKR governance from liquidating the vault. The Maker Representative shall be the \u201ctrusted\u201d interface between 6s, the trustee, and the MKR governance. Fundamentally, this reporting shall comprise an \u201canalog oracle.\u201d The foregoing notwithstanding, the 6s team will actively communicate with the community in addition to the Maker Representative. Further, a Technical MIP is being submitted for review. Please see the reference section at the bottom of this document. Liquidations The Trustee (a regulated Trust Company) will follow the Trust Agreement and the revolving credit facility agreement established for this transaction. If given a liquidation signal from MKR governance, it will liquidate all assets pursuant to the revolving credit facility agreement and the trust agreement for the benefit of the trust beneficiary and deliver proceeds to pay down the Vault balance. Capital Flow   Mint new DAI to TFE   TFE lends DAI to Trust  Send DAI to a U.S. broker-dealer FBO the trust (Ethereum address) Trustee instructs broker-dealer to exchange DAI for USD inside the trust account with the broker-dealer Trustee instructs broker-dealer to transfer USD to a bank account in the name of the trust    Trust lends USD to LendCo (1*)  Send to title company in escrow for a closing between LendCo and its borrower    LendCo conduct lending operations and either repays the loans to the Trust or recycles the capital back into another approved scope transaction   LendCo repays the Trust in USD (1*)  Trustee wires USD to trust\u2019s account with broker-dealer and instructions BD to exchange USD for DAI The Trust repays DAI to the TFE (Ethereum address)    The TFE repays DAI to the vault    Real World Asset module The below structure contemplates FIVE fundamental levers that MKR governance can control to influence LendCo\u2019s behavior:  Aggregate Debt Ceiling Risk Premium - Interest Rate Scope (may be modified by MKR governance ratification of a LendCo request) Equity Requirement per LendCo transaction (may be modified by MKR governance ratification of a LendCo request) Liquidation  Given the operational business needs of LendCo and the possible (if not likely) need to tweak parameters for the benefit of DAI stability, the frequency surrounding modifications should be on a weekly cycle with proper forum posts in advance. Once the legal entities and legal contracts are in place, MKR Governance need only modify the five levers above to control / incentivize LendCo (regardless of how many BorrowCos are behind LendCo). Why is this important? This proposal for the community introduces a new market force to help stabilize the DAI ecosystem. Further, it is a natural counterbalance to helping push DAI to its reference currency, the US Dollar. By introducing an external economically incentivized third-party, further liquidity will be added using an approved \u201ccapital sink.\u201d  It is critically important that any DAI that overflows into this structure for Real World Asset Backed Loans have the community\u2019s pre-approval for credit quality. A \u201ccapital sink\u201d or a \u201ccapital battery\u201d in this context means a known holding \u201cpool\u201d for capital that has been / can be deployed with the known credit in an approved structure.  By implementing legal structures that help secure the MakerDAO from the \u201chit by the bus scenarios,\u201d the DAI ecosystem will have an overflow value for excess DAI (when above $1) and a mechanism for encouraging repayment below $1. In doing this, a needed dampening effect is created that will help smooth out the DAI price. Graphical Objective 1362\u00d71600 563 KB The above is achieved by using market forces and an economically motivated off-chain structure.  Every time the market price is above 1, an economically motivated off-chain party should mint DAI to deploy off-chain. In reverse, when DAI is below 1, that same party should seek to repay the debt. When DAI is materially above 1, that party is well motivated to scale-up operations to deploy capital in-bulk. That capital could be held off-chain for weeks / months / years.  Time Horizon This proposal does not have a time restriction on how long the DAI will be borrowed by the TFE / the Trust / LendCo (1*). Rather LendCo is economically incentivized to respond to market forces and deploy / repay capital accordingly. As such, if the market conditions continue, the overflow DAI may be deployed (and recycled) off-chain for months / years. This size of the overflow / capital sink is constrained by:  Community approved debt ceiling LendCo operations (scope) LendCo economics  Legal Structure Selection The combination of a bankruptcy remote Trust + an Operating LLC (as a Lender, LendCo) is needed for a few essential reasons:  MakerDAO is a collection of unknown people or legal entities. A legal construct is needed to give them standing in a Court of Law to enforce a contract. A Trust with MakerDAO as beneficiary meets this requirement. Legal precedence with a bankruptcy remote Trust  If the trustee goes bankrupt, the assets of the trust will not become part of the bankruptcy estate of the trustee. The trust assets will always be separate and held for the beneficiary MarkerDAO. Industry familiarity with how to liquidate real-estate assets should a liquidation be triggered The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is commonplace for most large companies to access inexpensive costs of capital from a bank. A bank does not need a Trust to foreclose on assets in the event of a breach / liquidation. For MKR, since those rights are held by an unknown group, a Trust (above) is needed Concentration of compliance and audit requirements to LendCo Individually, a Trust structure is not new. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is not new. Pushing them together with MakerDAO as the beneficiary with an MKR community defined scope is novel. As a result of the above, from the big picture LendCo can borrow DAI / USD (1*) in significant scale without increasing the cognitive load on the MKR community / Maker Representative. The independent accountants handle the scale of transactions while the auditors ensure the books are being kept in accordance with GAAP. The Maker Representative then needs to review the aggregate work done by everyone else to attest to the community that things are in compliance.

He has run point on strategic planning / business development / creating strategic alliances / contract negotiation / SPV implementations & management including assisting in the overall strategy, negotiations and contract support for the large (~10GW) renewable energy consortium including Boone Pickens, Fluor Corp. BNSF Railways, ABB, and Siemens. Thereafter, he assisted in the overall strategy, negotiations and contract support for two Life Settlement Trust Certificate bond offerings. He co-managed for two private placement debt arbitrage pooled investment funds. To achieve the best pricing on debt securities, he co-founded and ran back office operations for both an SEC Registered Investment Advisor and a subsequently acquired FINRA Broker/Dealer. He co-managed an oil & gas SPV to acquire an operating oil field asset which was subsequently divested. Finally, he co-founded a commercial real-estate development firm and designed its corporate structure. Matt earned a Master in Business Administration from the University of Texas at Dallas and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Texas Tech University. Projects first in line The 6s team has identified two projects that have already cleared underwriting for financing after the above structure is put in place. Neither project has any construction/development risks. The two projects are both Ground Leases and have been \u201chanded over\u201d to the tenant. The Lease for each project is in force with the credit tenant on the hook to make rental payments with a store opening or date specific (whichever occurs first). No LOI or commitment to fund has been executed.   Transaction #1 Required Closing Proceeds: $3,700,000  (Last Appraisal: $5,620,000)    Transaction #2 Required Closing Proceeds: $5,200,000  (Last Appraisal: $7,140,000)    Both transactions will require refreshed appraisals prior to a possible closing.   Underlying Legal Documents   Documents are still being drafted and should be posted in this thread prior to the deadline for the final executive vote.   Note: The Trust Agreement will use the form provided by the selected corporate trustee. As one has not been finalized yet, we will provide a basic template; however, until a trustee is selected the \u201cactual\u201d draft cannot be provided. That said, we are proposing a Delaware statutory trust which means most of the terms of the trust agreement will come directly form the Delaware Trust Statute.

My concern here is that this particular facility will have to recify differently during an ES than other collateral types that are \u2018non-binding\u2019 in the sense that anyone owning DAI can redeem for their share of MCD assets within what 24-48hrs after an ES and that there i\u2026     ",

I will be posting it in the thread for community review when counsel has finalized the customization I requested. Painfully, there is no good way to make the legal agreements \u201csimple\u201d\u2026 The critical component with the entire structure is that the agreements are binding and enforceable with a Court of Law. The goal is that not only can LendCo use this structure but the many that come after. It must be a \u201cmarket\u201d deal and look quite similar to what a LendCo would get from a bank. That is the direction I am pushing for the community. RE the debt ceiling, LendCo will for sure consume all of it within 90d. LendCo has a pipeline of an additional 30MM in debt needs in Q1 2021. The above said, personally I am not concerned about the  structure, legal enforceability or the process, but I have learned in my career that the best way to gain trust is simply to earn it and never to ask for it. So my plan is radical transparency with basically anyone that will sign a NDA (maker rep or not) to give direct oversight as we get started. I am thinking to keep that up for 6 months or so, so the community can hear from those folks to allow that debt ceiling to be raised to meet the LendCo needs. Very much appreciate the support ! ",

                    "content": "@MakerMan excellent question\u2026 Following on with @g_dip 's comment, the Trust views the MKR tokens holders as the beneficiaries. The Trust is a legal entity with a Trust company as the Trustee. Unless they are specifically noticed, they will make the assumption that all is well and no \u201cliquidation\u201d has been instructed. So now insert the edge case of the Emergency Shutdown of the Maker protocol. It is also important to recognize there are fundamentally two scenarios for the ES. 1.) Something bad happened and the system needs to settle and relaunch. 2.) People are just done with the MKR protocol Case #1) The MKR token holders will relaunch\u2026 During the ES, the trustee cannot be noticed as MKR temporarily doesn\u2019t exist. However, when it does re-launch, it can reconstruct and transfer the debt from ver A to ver B\u2026 This actually solves a huge issue as LendCo doesn\u2019t technically ever know the difference\u2026 More importantly, the legal agreements between the Trust and LendCo have nothing to do with MKR re-launching. So there is NO scenario where LendCo gets free cash. The Trust always keeps the \u201cgun to the head\u201d of LendCo.  Further, it would not be advantageous to MKR (or LendCo) to have all of the LendCo assets liquidated (or practical) to then slam the market with DAI to deliver it. As the underlying intention is to relaunch, it is far better to \u201cstore\u201d the off-chain capital much like a battery to be delivered and paid down in the future. In this edge case, this is the 99.999% case. Case #2) If Maker has not intention of relaunching for operations, the collective of then MKR holders will get together and relaunch for the sole purpose of triggering the liquidation for LendCo, and pursuant to the Trust agreement, LendCo must wind down its operations. gracefully.  This is the 0.0001% of this edge case. The MKR token holders will be listed as beneficiaries of the Trust, including successive re-launches of the Maker protocol. Upon a relaunch, the Trustee and LendCo will then each be notified of where to pay down debt. Trust law has handled the notion of successors for a long time. ",

                    "content": "I had to think about this really. I think my point here is the details of the ES DAI redemption mechanics.   In a quick relaunch basically the new MCD could roll the loan.  But what this means is that the borrower (LendCo offshore) would get new_DAI that would then be deposited into the old MCD which could be redeemed normally by DAI holders.   The problem is the case where MCD does NOT relaunch then basically what in my mind is required is a promissary token from (LendCo offshore) to redeem tokens with something of suitable value (USDC?).   The issue here is that basically the debt becomes an impaired obligation for DAI holders trying to redeem for the claims on assets that by contract have to happen over time.   This is making me think that to borrow LendCo has to deposit some kind of Token to represent the $$ value owed so that DAI holders can redeem for \u2018something\u2019 even if they have to wait to redeem again. I really want to hear someone from MCD development team comment on this. My point here is that every borrower deposits something (collateral) that DAI holders can redeem for \u2018immediately\u2019 after a system shut down.  Unless I am missing something I don\u2019t see what DAI holders would be redeeming for.  I also think even if you were to create a token that represents \u2018debt owed\u2019 that given the terms of the agreements this becomes an impaired asset for the DAI holders.  (quite literally if MCD does not relaunch and the debt can\u2019t be rolled into a new facility before redemptions start occuring there is nothing to redeem for). ",

But what this means is that the borrower (LendCo offshore) would get new_DAI that would then be deposited into the old MCD which could be redeemed normally by DAI holders.   In this structure, LendCo never wants to hold DAI. It will almost always sell it for USD to conduct operations. The only time it will have DAI is right before it pays down a vault balance.     MakerMan:   The issue here is that basically the debt becomes an impaired obligation for DAI holders trying to redeem for the claims on assets that by contract have to happen over time.    Correct. LendCo can operate with a \u201cgun to its head\u201d, but it cannot operate with a demand payment structure to fire sale everything at the drop of a hat. No one will ever deploy capital that way. There are multiple edge cases here.  If there is a liquidation If there is an emergency shutdown If both #1 & #2 happen at the same time and the system restarts Same as #3 but the system doesn\u2019t restart  So:  As an operating business in the business of providing loans, if a liquidation is triggered, to maximize the proceeds of liquidation, a fire sale is NOT recommended for obvious reasons. It will take time to recover funds, and once recovered, the Trustee will cause those to be paid to MKR via the same mechanism that LendCo would use to pay down the vault. In an emergency shutdown, the Trustee has no clue it happened. LendCo from an operating perspective has no clue it happened. Only impact is that LendCo cannot cause new DAI to be minted. MKR holders gather, and relaunch and migrate the debt over to the new system. All the legal docs stay exactly the same. The debt outstanding didn\u2019t change. LendCo winds down. The Trust holds the liquidated cash proceeds from the sale of LendCo assets in favor of the new launch of the Maker protocol (almost like updating a payment mailing address). Extreme edge case. I cannot see a scenario where the system doesn\u2019t restart at all. This would imply all MKR token holders all throw up their hands and just walk away (and not one person decides to restart it). BUT if that where to happen, LendCo could not borrow any newly issued money. It would be able to continue its operations under the terms of the RCFA. When the RCFA would be paid back, all of the cash would sit with the Trust in favor of the beneficiaries until such time as a payment address could be determined.  ",

                    "content": "Emergency Shutdown behaves differently than liquidations so this does need special handling. In short, when emergency shutdown happens, the DAO will allow every DAI holder to convert their DAI to the underlying collateral. We have been working on a solution (and thanks to @equivrel for sanity checking my proposal) that can address this that will work equally well for Centrifuge than for your proposal. @g_dip, you were right, there can definitely be cross pollination. A simplified example: 10 DAI have been minted, 5 were minted with 1 ETH as collateral and 5 DAI were minted to your credit facility, @mrabino1 against $5 worth of real estate. In ES this is what\u2019s happening: Any user can cash out their DAI for the underlying collateral. If you own one DAI you can go to the DAO and you will get 0.1 ETH (1/10th of the ETH collateral) and you\u2019re supposed to get $0.1 from your credit facility. The problem is: how can a DAI holder get their $0.1 from the trustees or from a lending SPV? The normal method that is currently supported by End (the smart contract that manages Emergency Shutdown) has a way that it can give you some of the collateral that was originally in the Vault. For security tokens (like Centrifuge\u2019s) or the assets you\u2019re talking about that exist completley off-chain, there is either no such token or you might not be legally allowed to own it (because you\u2019re not an accredited investor). Without derailing this thread too much and taking it off topic, the answer lies in creating a specific contract that can trustlessly in a fully automated way can \u201cgive you the underlying collateral\u201d which in that case most likely would either be just an equal amount of DAI or some other stablecoin. So you could get 0.1 DAI or 0.1 USDC for the fraction of your DAI that was backed by the real estate in your proposal. When I have a free moment I will write this down in a bit more detail and can show how this can work for both of our assets. ",

I remembered that someone was working on a Emergency Shutdown report because I was working on an analysis but don\u2019t know if there was such a report made.  I think it would be prudent to examine what an ES means not just in face of new collateral types but as a general matter of course of evolution of the Maker system. The implications of a Maker ES covering the entire space/system, whether or not RWA\u2019s are added is important,   The whole topic of whether Maker should work to change the whole Emergency Shutdown mechanics into 'smart contract halting/maintenance approach\u2019would be in order in another forum thread.   A MIP13 proposal really isn\u2019t the place for general ES considerations even though there are real issues to address with RWA\u2019s. In general I think this proposal is well thought out (even if somewhat complex in detail) and the Maker protocol desperately needs to grow asset classes, as well as DAI outstanding,.and RWA\u2019s are great additions to do this.  I really want to see these RWA\u2019s move forward and while I want to see this I also realize more work to evolve the protocol is required.

Hope it\u2019s helpful.     mrabino1:  Declaration Statement: Off-Chain Asset Backed Lender to onboard Real World Assets into the Maker Protocol to borrow DAI and deploy in the \u201cReal World\u201d.   The idea of this statement is to be a sort of summary of the actual declaration. I\u2019d suggest phrasing it in the form: \u201cMaker governance intends to\u2026\u201d In this case I\u2019d suggest something like: \u201cMaker governance intends to onboard off-chain asset backed lenders using the structure detailed in this Declaration.\u201d I think this is what you intend us to vote on, but if I\u2019ve misunderstood, please adjust to your intention.     mrabino1:  Context and Motivation   Seems good. I would maybe try to reduce word-count, but fairly low-priority issue imo.     mrabino1:  Declaration Detail   I would try to make better use of multi-level headers here. With something of this length, I\u2019d even be tempted to include something akin to a table of contents. Or at least an introductory paragraph describing the major sections and their importance.     mrabino1:  Specific Declaration of Intent   So there has maybe been some confusion here. You are writing this on behalf of MakerDAO itself, rather than on behalf of 6s. This declaration is something Maker Governance is declaring (if this proposal passes.) So for example, instead of phrasing this as:     mrabino1:  6s, as an off-chain asset backed lender, desires to engage with the MKR community to cause the addition of a new collateral type along with new roles that would need to be filled from a person(s) / entity nominated by MKR holders.   It should be phrased something like this: \u201cMaker Governance  declares the intention to engage with 6s as an off-chain asset backed lender with the aim of adding a new collateral type and the new roles required to support this collateral type as detailed later in this proposal.\u201d In this way, when the proposal is voted on, MKR Holders either agree to ratify the proposal and confirm the declaration as written, or reject it.     mrabino1:  6s works with multiple commercial real estate developers throughout the United States. 6s provides secured loans equal to 100% Loan-to-Cost for construction and the underlying real estate acquisition until completion for build-to-suits and ground leases for Credit Tenant Leases.   I appreciate that this is maybe super clear to someone who is more up to speed in the finance or business world. Can you describe what this means in practice in laymans terms? What is the loaned capital used for? Buying real-estate and constructing buildings to specifications provided by tenants?     mrabino1:  Further, rather than a digital oracle to automate the decision of whether a \u201cbreach\u201d has occurred that would then trigger a liquidation, 6s and MKR governance* would enter into a revolving credit facility agreement whereby the obligations / requirements / covenants are laid out in written form enforceable in a Court of Law (as opposed to purely numeric with a pricing oracle) or code.   Is this still part of the high-level overview? It seems like a fairly drastic context switch. After this it seems to dive into the role of the Maker Representative. I don\u2019t think this is wrong necessarily, but I do think the flow of this document is off at this point. Changing topic without having an additional header is bad imo, and makes it confusing to follow.     mrabino1:  Provide a brief history of the project:   Can this section just be combined with the \u2018high-level overview of the project\u2019? It\u2019s at this stage I\u2019m realising you\u2019re following the questions in the MIP6 application form. In some ways this is good, because it means this declaration includes the required information. On the other hand, that format really wasn\u2019t designed to fit into a proposal. I think if it were me, I would post the answers to the MIP6 questions in a separate document and then reference that document in this declaration of intent. I would probably aim to follow this structure with the attached term sheet documents as well. Provide them as supporting materials, but don\u2019t include them directly in the text of this declaration.     mrabino1:  Matthew Rabinowitz\u2019s Bio:   Again, I would maybe provide this as supporting material, but not directly inline. I think I\u2019m going to stop there for the time being, for two reasons:  It\u2019s late and I\u2019m sleepy. The way this is structured makes it hard work to follow.  Regarding content, I\u2019m having trouble engaging with it given the current structure and my general unfamiliarity with the concepts involved. I\u2019d be happy to take another look once the structure has been cleaned up a bit. ",

Some questions though:   What\u2019s the Trust Company and Administrator that you\u2019re proposing to use for this? Seems like a crucial point to address as MakerDAO obviously needs to be able to evaluate its rights in case something should go awry and one or several of these borrowers cannot repay.   Could you please share a copy of the proposed a) Security Agreement between Lendco and the Trust, and b) the Operating Agreement for Lendco?   a. Given that the token that you\u2019re proposing to deposit as collateral has no redemption rights, voting rights, or economic value I think its particularly important to better understand specifically what you mean when you say that \u201call\u201d of Lendco\u2019s rights will be irrevocably assigned to the Trust.  Where if I understand correctly, legal beneficiary of the trust will technically be a MakerDAO representative will the the sole beneficiary of the Trust (do I have that right?).  It might be nice to see some legal analysis on how this works, but I dont think this is a strict requirement provided that we can grok the Trust documents, Security Agreements. b.  I think we need to see the operating agreement to better understand the balance of rights between the financing that the DAO will provide and the preferred equity that you\u2019re proposing to raise.  It might be nice to hear from and get the perspective of some of LendCo\u2019s proposed or current preferred equity investors.   It kind of seems like a pretty precarious time for anyone to be investing in commercial real estate (see e.g. https://www.ft.com/content/e4b2302b-76c5-494a-8560-e6d24de9358f?list=intlhomepage) and while I don\u2019t doubt that rising there is opportunity we definitely need to know more specifics about who, and where the borrowers you\u2019re proposing to provide financing to. This list is nice but I think we need many more details about these projects.   To be clear you haven\u2019t closed on any of these projects yet? We may want to kind of see you close on a few deals first to so that we can kind of familiarize ourselves with this process with some real world demonstrations of this model.   Like when you say \u201cno speculative project risk\u201d it kind of makes me a bit suspicious bc commercial real estate financing def seems risk af presently, and you\u2019re proposal uses a lot of technical terms of art like \u201cshovel ready\u201d etc that we just generally dont understand.   On some level, it feels a bit like you\u2019re asking us to play VC on a collateral types that are difficult for this community to reason about compared to say shitcoins, where ( I think ) the failure modes are pretty well understood.  Here, its a bit murkier as its not directly in our wheelhouse.   Who is conducting these appraisals and can we please see the appraisal documentation for these two proposed deals?    Having a really hard time understanding specifically what you mean here.  Could you please give us the ELI5? Like in one sentence, assume these borrowers go bankrupt or like rioters destroy the property they are proposing to build and they cant repay Lendco, could you presumably inflate the valuation of one of the loans that Lendco provides even though the property/lease/etc is worthless? Maybe if we could start with the worst case and if you could describe how you could fuck over the DAO by leaning on these \u201cGap Collateral Rights\u201d that would be super helpful.   I have other nitpicky things re the actual amount of money you\u2019re requesting (which seems high given the speculative nature of this project in terms of both the assets and the \u201cconsumability\u201d of this collateral type), and the general inspection rights that you\u2019re proposing to the DAO but these kind of seem ancillary to the questions above. (Re inspection rights: have you considered making this MakerDAO representative a unit holder in LendCo LLC? Like some extreme de minimus amount simply to preserve the statutory inspection rights in DE.  You could easily imagine any distributions paid out to this minority unit holder would be pledged to some charity like the free software foundation etc etc.) ",

                    "content": "@chris Good questions. Many of your questions / comments may need a follow-up call (or a call from your attorney to mine). Let me start to address below.     chris:  What\u2019s the Trust Company and Administrator that you\u2019re proposing to use for this?   We are engaged with several Trustee attorneys at this point to get their recommendation. Wilmington Trust would be an ideal candidate. One has not been selected yet.     chris:   Seems like a crucial point to address as MakerDAO obviously needs to be able to evaluate its rights in case something should go awry and one or several of these borrowers cannot repay.    The borrowers engage with LendCo. If a borrower cannot repay, LendCo will foreclose on them. The primary time the Trust is used is when a liquidation event is triggered by MKR governance.     chris:   Could you please share a copy of the proposed a) Security Agreement between Lendco and the Trust, and b) the Operating Agreement for Lendco?    Legal drafts will be posted soon. Regarding the operating agreement, I need to get guidance from counsel. We need to find a way to get you / the community comfortable with the contents. That said, I am not running a public securities offering (and the operating agreement represents that security). I would be happy to have your attorney speak to mine to get the substance. Let me get back with you / the community on this point.     chris:  Given that the token that you\u2019re proposing to deposit as collateral has no redemption rights, voting rights, or economic value I think its particularly important to better understand specifically what you mean when you say that \u201call\u201d of Lendco\u2019s rights will be irrevocably assigned to the Trust.   In the same context that LendCo would receive borrowed funds from the Trust (which it received from the Maker protocol), the Trust should only every provide a loan when it knows that it has some protection for providing that loan. In this case, the revolving credit facility agreement and the \u201ccut through agreement\u201d are the agreements that give the Trust comfort / assurances as to what the funds can be used for, the terms, etc\u2026  So table the \u201ccut through agreement\u201d for a moment and go one layer down\u2026 LendCo will then only loan money to a BorrowCo when it consummates a transaction whereby LendCo sends money for a simultaneous close where by LendCo receives clean title to a senior lien w/ a promissory note, loan documents, assignments, assurances from the principals of BorrowCo etc. This part is exceptionally important. LendCo has to hope for the best and always plan for the worst. LendCo has to always make the assumption that every loan will default. This means LendCo might have to take over a project that for whatever reason didn\u2019t get completed. Of course, all of the agreements that are executed in exchange for LendCo\u2019s capital are to ensure and mitigate every conceivable risk from that happening. But in the worst case, if LendCo has to foreclose on the project and sue to the principals of BorrowCo to recover funds, it will. All of those \u201crights\u201d and enforcements are in the deal book for that one loan (LendCo gets those rights in exchange for capital). Going back up a level, the \u201ccut through agreement\u201d allows the Trust (in the event of a liquidation) to push LendCo to the side and have the same ability as LendCo to step in the shoes of LendCo and foreclose on all of the borrowers. The important take away here is that for a Lender (LendCo). The Loans are the assets of the company. Those loans must be enforceable. And ALL of the rights that LendCo receives from each BorrowCo are unconditionally and irrevocably assigned to the Trust.  It is the only way the Trust can cause a foreclosure on LendCo\u2019s assets EVEN IF LendCo files bankruptcy. LendCo is powerless to stop the Trust\u2019s rights. Summary: LendCo has a gun to its head from the Trust. And LendCo puts a gun to the head of each of the BorrowCos (and their principals) to perform. Everyone is incentivized to repay the loans.     chris:  Where if I understand correctly, legal beneficiary of the trust will technically be a MakerDAO representative will the the sole beneficiary of the Trust (do I have that right?).   No. The Maker rep is a person / entity. The beneficiaries of the Trust should be Maker Token holders (or its successor in the event of an ES and relaunch).     chris:  It might be nice to see some legal analysis on how this works, but I dont think this is a strict requirement provided that we can grok the Trust documents, Security Agreements.   Note: The Trust Company will require us to use their \u201cform\u201d for the Statutory Trust agreement. Until a Trust company is selected, it is impossible to provide the live version. However, a Statutory Trust is driven by statute. So there shouldn\u2019t be massive changes. The key components that will be unique will be A.) the beneficiary (above) and B.) The Liquidation trigger which is caused by MKR governance. (Fundamentally where to look on the blockchain to see if Vault has been triggered / cured / liquidated, etc.). The rest of the Statutory Trust should follow their form. As I wrote above, I am happy to also get on a conference call with you / your attorney to provide additional clarity.     chris:  I think we need to see the operating agreement to better understand the balance of rights between the financing that the DAO will provide and the preferred equity that you\u2019re proposing to raise.   Important. I am not aiming to raise any equity from the community. I am not running a public offering. I am only looking for a revolver (debt) under terms. That said, fundamentally, there are two classes of equity and then debt. In terms of liquidation preference, the debt always gets paid back first. Thus the revolver (from the Trust) would be in first position, meaning any liquidated proceeds would pay the DAI loan first. then the preferred equity investors. and last, any money that is left over goes to the common equity. As I wrote above, I am happy to also get on a conference call with you / your attorney to provide additional clarity.     chris:  It kind of seems like a pretty precarious time for anyone to be investing in commercial real estate   This one specific area of commercial real estate (credit tenant leases) specific to those that have \u201crecession resistant\u201d tenants is not only doing decent during COVID-19, it is expanding rapidly. The triple-net lease space (or Ground Lease) is a unique area of commercial real-estate. If were intending to build movie theaters or high rise office towers, this would have exposure (and I don\u2019t like exposure. I am always looking for how to de-risk the transaction). Important aspect is that we are not providing capital to the tenants. As a lender, LendCo lends money to developers that build the locations pursuant to an already executed lease (critical, as the tenant significantly de-risks the transaction). Thus the tenant is on the hook to pay rent once the location is built. Thus prior to close, we must also have a general contractor committed to build the location (along with GC mgmt oversight). The developer has his / her profit locked in the project and doesn\u2019t make a dime of profit until he / she divests the project. The developer (aka BorrowCo) is well motivated having taken the development risk & construction risk to then divest the project. In doing so, they repay LendCo. LendCo can then repay DAI. The Tenant selection is an essential component to the mix. I bring up movie theaters for no other reason than the tenants outlined above have been intentionally selected, as they fit the narrative of recession-resistant / amazon-resistant. (critical) As outlined, the scope of operations of LendCo is initially agreed between the community and LendCo. After which the community may amend the operations of LendCo by ratifying a LendCo request. The proposed scope is constrained to no development risk with pre-defined tenants (known and researchable credit pricing) with known lease structures. No development risk means, that LendCo will not close on a transaction unless it has clean title to a senior lien on the underlying real-estate / an assignment of an enforceable credit tenant lease / an assignment of the engineering work / an assignment of the arch work / an assignment of the General Contractor (and commitment to build the location) / developer must have all of the permits & insurance / developer must have a GC engaged to do the work / the list goes one\u2026 but there are underwriting requirements that LendCo will follow before a dime of LendCo money is released for a given project. Stepping back: Banks provide capital (loans) for these projects across the country today. This is not new as they are secured senior lenders. Typically the borrower needs to raise corresponding equity (30% typically) to marry to the bank\u2019s 70%. We are abstracting the equity raise from the borrower to LendCo such that it can then provide a 100% Loan-to-Cost to a willing borrower. In that case, the borrower just doesn\u2019t need to raise equity. The objective is to have the equity consolidated at the core (LendCo) so we can scale operations. Summary: The objective is to have the risk profile for LendCo\u2019s revolver, e.g. Maker, be the SAME as a bank.     chris:  To be clear you haven\u2019t closed on any of these projects yet?   I have be directly involved in 11 of them on the borrowing side ($~35MM). No defaults. Some still under construction. More closing soon. 6s Capital is being setup to be a lender for an upcoming pipeline of transactions with a portfolio of pre-approved tenants.     chris:  Like when you say \u201cno speculative project risk\u201d it kind of makes me a bit suspicious   See comment above. LendCo does not take speculative risk. Developers take speculative risk. LendCo is the senior lender during construction / refinance. LendCo only closes on deals that been de-risked from developmental perspective.     chris:  On some level, it feels a bit like you\u2019re asking us to play VC on a collateral types   Not related to VC risk at all. No speculative risk. Credit and construction risk. Both will be mitigated to the maximum extent possible. LendCo will have the senior lien on a portfolio of projects, thus we are then de-risking further by removing geographic risks, etc. At some point, LendCo starts to look like a bank, but it is not one.     chris:   Who is conducting these appraisals and can we please see the appraisal documentation for these two proposed deals?    It is industry practice that all loans require an independent appraisal that are certified (such appraisal is always ordered by the lender, not the borrower). LendCo never does the appraisal. Typically groups like BBG (https://bbgres.com/our-services/valuation/) would be used. LendCo will contract with a firm (like BBG) to generate an independent appraisal. I am happy to share the historic appraisals (and the needed updates) with the Maker Representative(s) prior to any contemplated closing.  Every loan that LendCo ever does must be well documented and packaged to show to an auditor during our annual audit of LendCo financial statements as well as Maker Rep inspection. That appraisal must be in that package. It provides one of the core metrics to base a Loan-to-Value constraint calculation.     chris:  Gap Collateral - Having a really hard time understanding specifically what you mean here.   Two angles to view Gap collateral.  1.) If LendCo has a recent independent appraisal that says a given project is worth $10MM, but the Borrower only wants to borrow $2MM (e.g. they have 10 acres of land, but the project is only using 1 of them). If LendCo has the senior lien on the project and all of the land, the difference is value that LendCo can claim as Gap collateral. In this case that would be up to $8MM.  2.) If LendCo makes it a requirement for BorrowCo to put up additional collateral (eg\u2026 they are a new developer with a minimal track record), in addition to a personal guarantee, LendCo may require them to post addition collateral (if cash, via a control agreement, no appraisal is needed). In the case of real-estate, a recent independent appraisal would be needed. To your comment on what are the things that could be done wrong, LendCo has discretion on constraints regarding its lending activities provided it doesn\u2019t breach its equity requirements. However, changing the appraisal or ignoring the values would be a clear breach. LendCo would not survive an audit and most certainly not survive a Maker Rep inspection. MKR would then trigger a liquidation. There is a reason there is a gun to the head of LendCo. Further, there is a reason there is a gun to the head of BorrowCo. Put simply, economic incentives to perform and structure setup to protect the rights of the Lender (LendCo or the Trust). When everyone performs, everyone wins.     chris:  the actual amount of money you\u2019re requesting (which seems high   To get a large name-brand known Trust company, a $15MM start is on the extremely low-end of the scale. If we go any lower, we cannot get Trust companies to want to be in a Trustee role. Further, this structure is designed such that the legal enforceability regardless of scale still protects MKR. By having a strict operating scope and a controlled list of tenants, MKR governance has a clear idea of the risk profile of the end tenant. By legal enforceability opinions from BorrowCo on each loan, and LendCo having an equity \u201cbuffer\u201d that comes AFTER the Trust, the objective is to always keep the Trust exceptionally well protected.     chris:  and the general inspection rights   All of those inspection rights are contractually granted via and may be found in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement  As outlined above, I am happy to get on a call and go over the above points and get your attorney in contact with mine to get additional comfort.

One of the more attractive aspects to the proposed structure is moving the control to MKR governance to allow for updates to scope, interest rate, equity requirements, and debt ceiling amounts without changing the legal contracts or the structure as a whole. Thus as 6s grows and adds a \u201cnew capital sink\u201d that the MKR Governance approves, 6s can expand its model (with the associated compliance reporting staying virtually the same). Further, the time horizon (like other MKR vaults) doesn\u2019t have a specific contemplated end date (except that the structure will terminate when the debt ceiling is zero and the amount outstanding is zero for more than a year). Thus, our interests are aligned with building a relationship that is built on rock for the long-haul.     latetot:  Why is this worth the trouble for them?   Excellent point. With an initial debt ceiling of 15MM, the economics of setting this entire construct up have about a 10 year break-even. It is painfully expensive upfront. That said, from the perspective of 6s, this is a strategic investment to be first and to demonstrate to the community over time why an increased debt ceiling is both justified and helpful. ",
