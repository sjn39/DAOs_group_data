                    "content": "Following the brainstorm, now is the time to quantify what is our mission/vision for MakerDAO. I keep the objectives on the side for now. Below is the description of each possible mission/vision for MakerDAO. Those are stereotypes, the reality is obviously more complex than a one-liner. If needed I can detail more some aspects. I can\u2019t change the poll after publishing, but if you come up with a new type of mission/vision, please put it in the comments for discussion. Below, there are two polls. The first one only allows one choice and the second one is multiple choices. I suggest that you avoid selecting all options in the second poll (I know it is tempting). There are pros and cons for each method so the easiest way is to do both. If the results are interesting and if that makes sense (I delegate that to @LongForWisdom ), the same question will be put on-chain. Mission list Maker the CryptoBank corporation Be the biggest bank amongst DeFi and CeFi thanks to a first-class workforce and governance. Banks being defined as what a bank means in the future. Expanding the competitive landscape to CeFi (Square is next on the list, then HSBC and BoA). Put an emphasis on the importance of the workforce (paying our teams with the protocol money, being the best place to work) and the governance community. Maker Autonomous Protocol Be the leader in stablecoin lending and provide a good return to MKR holders This is a narrower mission and it avoids pushing the scope too far and over-investing to remunerate the MKR token holders. One target is to have the least human interaction in the day to day activity. So most likely a small or no dedicated workforce and low governance overhead. Maker The Money Lego Be the key building block in DeFi and change the world Support all the DeFi by having the best permissionless, trustless system. Be at the bottom on the Protocol Sink Thesis . Put an emphasis on the protocol versus front-end for instance. Also, need a lot of interaction with other protocols to collectively create the best possible version of DeFi. Maker Making the World a better Place Banking the Unbanked Put an emphasis on the retail market, marketing, and the front-end. Leverage the work done by the Foundation in Latam and elsewhere. Single choice poll     Maker the CryptoBank corporation Maker Autonomous Protocol Maker The Money Lego Maker Making the World a better Place Abstain     0 voters     Multiple choice poll     Maker the CryptoBank corporation Maker Autonomous Protocol Maker The Money Lego Maker Making the World a better Place Abstain     0 voters     Polls open until January, 20th.

The visions as single statements don\u2019t work for me as a \u2018vision\u2019 and two of them seem to overlap  Maker the CryptoBank corporation, Maker The Money Lego. Maker making the world a better place is far too ambitious, or really ambiguous. Given that the key element of Maker is DAI I personally think that being a capital vendor (ala a Decentralized Bank that manages its own currency) is probably the key point to focus on for vision. Being a bank means doing bank like things, managing liquidity, return on assets deposited in a fully transparent fashion. A focus predominantly on return and asset securitization (doing everything possible to offer options to users to help them NOT get liquidated, or if liquidated getting the highest return on assets).   Maker needs to be the strongest peg in the DeFI protocol space and DAI has to be one of the most secure and open stablecoins that is permissionless, fully decentralized, and as antifragile as possible. This is my own view though.   I think when it comes to vision writing up a realistic statement of what each vision means both for owners, users, defi and crypto in general is critical.   I had an idea to write my own vision - simply to offer up \u2018a vision\u2019 but would be happy to see what others can come up with.  How about a vision for maker contest.    50MKR, 20 to runner up, 10 to third.  Anyway.  Moving on. ",

In terms of governance process I think I\u2019d like to see a good number of people providing input on a DoI (potentially with informal polls to help determine support for various clauses). I\u2019d also direct attention to MIP1, which includes a vague list along the same lines of what you are going for here. One might consider making an amendment to that MIP rather than a DoI. The issue with doing something like this as a signal request is that the contents of signals are very easy to \u2018lose\u2019 after the signal finishes and disappear in the forum. At least with the MIPs process there is a ratified record of what had token holder and community support. I\u2019d also argue that this is a fairly critical decision that probably deserves more input, and perhaps some face to face meetings to discuss the various merits of different goals. On a personal note, I\u2019d like to see a more concrete set of goals alongside more general mission or objective statements. ",
