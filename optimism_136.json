                    "content": "Project Name: Celestia Labs Author Name: Aditi with feedback from Mustafa Al-Bassam, John Adler, Nick White, Yaz Khoury, Ismail Khoffi, and Zaki Manian Number of OP tokens to claim: 300,000 L2 Recipient Address: [TBD] Relevant Usage Metrics Celestia is the marriage of Ethereum\u2019s rollup centric roadmap, Cosmos\u2019 sovereign interoperable zones, and shared security. Celestia is a consensus and data availability layer and is currently poised to be a leading ecosystem (check out the current testnet here). Optimism Alignment A Celestium is an improvement on a validium that uses Celestia instead of a centralized and unaccountable data availability committee (DAC). Celestiums are not technically Ethereum rollups as the data availability is off-chain to Ethereum, but are Ethereum sidechains with higher data availability guarantees, or the \u201coptimistic\u201d version of validiums. Celestiums use Ethereum for settlement and dispute resolution, while using Celestia as a data availability layer. Optimistic and zero-knowledge sidechains can leverage a Celestium to decrease calldata costs and still maintain cryptoeconomic security guarantees. Celestia Labs plans to deploy a Celestium Testnet, leveraging a fork of Optimism and the quantum gravity bridge, a Celestia-to-EVM message relay. This testnet will be focused on cutting edge R&D experimentation, starting with alternate data availability layers (referenced by the Optimism team here). No tokens/tokenomics are currently planned for the Celestium Testnet. Celestia Labs is requesting 300,000 OP tokens. Builders are crucial to any ecosystem and as such, 50% (150,000 tokens) will be allocated to grants which will encourage the community to build on top of the testnet and add core features. The remaining 50% (150,000 tokens) will be allocated to fund core development of this work. Proposal for Token Distribution   How will OP tokens be distributed? If this governance proposal is passed, Celestia Labs will allocate 150,000 OP to ecosystem grants funding builders building on top of the testnet. Celestia Labs will retain the 150,000 OP as funding to build out the Celestium Testnet.   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? This will help bootstrap the growth of the Optimism ecosystem and allow for broader experimentation. This will also further contribute to core development and improvement on the upstream Optimism codebase which will ensure more usage as more builders test out new features and core improvements to Optimism.   Why will incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Funding builders to add features on the testnet can bring in more users. Those users may become regular users of the Optimism ecosystem and may not leave easily (as seen with other ecosystems like Polygon). With the contributions brought by builders on the Optimism-fork, it can become an R&D-focused testnet for Optimism where core-features and improvements can be merged upstream to the Optimism codebase. As more core features are added, builders are incentivized to test out those new features with their smart contracts and dApps built on top of the Optimism-fork prior to deploying on Optimism mainnet.   Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? 6-12 months.   How much will your project match in co-incentives? Celestia Labs is willing to match 50% of the Optimism grant, as 50% of the asking amount will be distributed to ecosystem efforts. The co-incentive match will be based on the USD amount at the time $OP is granted. Celestia Labs will also fund the core developers working on this project beyond the 150,000 tokens allocated to core development.   ",

The value of Optimism and Arbitrum lies in the fact that the data is on Ethereum thats why people use L2s in the first place. If they wouldnt care about this they could use Polygon or BSC. I want my transactions to be secured by Ethereum or else all of this (rollup centric roadmap) has no meaning. ",

I don\u2019t think that this would be possible until the Bedrock upgrade which I believe is at least several months away (no dates have been announced yet). My main question: What do you see as the primary benefit(s) of carrying out this experiment? I feel that your proposal is currently too vague about the exact benefit to the Optimism ecosystem. You state that:  This will also further contribute to core development and improvement on the upstream Optimism codebase which will ensure more usage as more builders test out new features and core improvements to Optimism  Do you have concrete examples of the sort of contributions you would imagine that this would bring? Optimism\u2019s tight ties to Ethereum are core to the Optimism culture, roadmap, and security model. It seems unlikely that the Optimism community would choose to use Celestia as the primary DA layer. Optimism is investing lots of time and energy into EIP-4844 which should reduce costs without needing to leave Ethereum as the primary DA. ",

Nevertheless, governance funds allocated for phase 1 says  any project on Optimism can submit a forum proposal to request any amount of OP tokens. The proposal must include a plan for how the tokens will incentivize growth on Optimism.  In this sense, If Celestia devs/contributors wants to deploy a Optimism fork, I can made some open questions (for all): Is this (Celestium idea) truly part of Optimism ecosystem? or would we be just supporting a potential new \u2018not at all/semi-L2\u2019 chain? Is this responsibility of the OP governance about fund beyond proposals that will surely not impact the primary network?. Ethos on Optimism is closely aligned to Ethereum in many ways. By example, it\u2019s different from funding Ethereum DA roadmap initiative, because it positively impacts the Optimism mainnet at some point in the future. At the moment I don\u2019t see that this proposal helps to grow the Optimism ecosystem in terms of greater use of the primary network (first goal in our vision). I expect this discussion is going to go on for a long while. ",

                    "content": "    adeets_22:  The testnet ideally benefits the development of Optimism as a broader codebase for R&D experimentation and bringing people into the Optimism ecosystem   I think that realistically this proposal is maybe at least 6-12 months too early to be executed on effectively. I\u2019m hoping that the Optimism codebase can eventually turn into a base platform for other optimistic rollups and this proposal aligns with that idea. From a practical standpoint though, Bedrock, Cannon, and EIP-4844 should be the primary focus right now and finishing these tasks will make it much easier to plug in alternative DA layers (I assume that implementing EIP-4844 will be a good test for Bedrock\u2019s modularity). So for right now my opinion here is that this proposal too early right now but is worth considering at a later point in time and should probably be re-proposed in 6-12 months when Bedrock and EIP-4844 are live.
