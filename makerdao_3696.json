As many know, there was an informal poll regarding the 84k MKR received from the foundation, and we currently have a signal request to send them to the burner.  While MakerDAO having mint/burn capabilities over MKR may make the \u201cProtocol Treasury\u201d (as it is called on daistats.com) economically meaningless, there can be little doubt it is psychologically significant. I therefore wish to propose that MakerDAO create a highly memetic \u201cProtocol Treasury\u201d hoard by burning MKR from or minting MKR to the treasury to achieve the most infectious meme. Pros  Removes the cognitive overhead of having such a boring Protocol Treasury value Possibly good PR for MakerDAO  Cons  Engineering time to craft the spell Some people could find the meme distasteful Likely additional cost to commission accompanying artwork  Please indicate which numbers you think would be most virulently memorable.  I have included only numbers which will keep the total supply of MKR, including the treasury, under the very nice and memorable \u201c1 million\u201d.    Favorite Treasury Meme Number  1 42 69 420 1337 11111 36666 (ape yearn) 36667 (surpass yearn) 42069 55555 69420 77777 84000.1 (no change) 84048 84848 88888 88888.88888 90210 92429 Abstain     0 voters     Final Results: 75% of votes were Abstain or No Change. Therefore, signal has been closed and no further action will be taken. ",
