I\u2019d like to open up the discussion here for further discussion. The idea was inspired by Universal Logins and Web3Connect. Description: ENS allows users to store data in a key value store associated with a given ENS name. To allow for a wallet agnostic login widget (example below), users can add urls to web3 providers in their ENS name\u2019s key value store under keys such as \u201cprovider-mainnet\u201d. In the widget users can enter their ENS name and click \u201clog in\u201d. The widget can then look up the appropriate provider URL in the ENS contract and then download the provider from that URL. The provider can then be passed to the dapp which will then instantiate web3 (or other alternatives) with the provider. (e.g. var web3 = Web3(provider)). As @danfinlay suggested here, a user could register different providers for each network. It was also suggested by @cmeisl that users could register different providers to be used on desktop vs mobile. We plan to build a PoC (with @shane, @amxx, and @dobrokhvalov) for our ETHBerlin hack and then write up a draft of the standard but wanted to open up the discussion for ideas, suggestions, and concerns from the rest of the ETH Magicians community in the meantime.

A couple thoughts:  Ensure either some measure of privacy about the user\u2019s choice of which client they use, or a robustness to the paths of their choice such that the choice could not be faked by a malicious dapp in order to target them and their cryptocurrency. I\u2019m not quite sure how one would go about doing this, but it is important if this preference were to live on-chain that there is guards against such malicious behavior on the user side. Internationalization choices might be nice to consider as a part of this standard. See ERC-1444 for inspiration or integration: EIP-1444: Localized Messaging with Signal-to-Text  Not sure if this is the right place, but it seems related to the idea I\u2019ve been considering with ERC for \"Execute as\". The basic idea of having a set of handlers that the user chooses for how their web3 connection should be handled (and how transactions are submitted, etc.) would integrate nicely here. Instead of maintaining a bunch of dapp-specific or wallet-specific functionality, this could serve as a common standard for translation of multi-party, smart-contract based accounts to the front-end user. If it makes sense, please consider that with this proposal.  ",
