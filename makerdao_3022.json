                    "content": "Hello everyone! As you might have noticed I\u2019m pretty new to the scene over here at Maker, but what can I say, it\u2019s truly been one of those eye-opening rabbit holes that makes my brain fire off in every direction. I think the story of Maker is one of intrigue, innovation, and struggle. With my background (creative writing minor and journalism experience in and out of college), I realized I definitely have the tools to try to tell the story of MakerDAO and I think it\u2019s something people would love to hear about. I don\u2019t know what makes the most sense at this point, but I know whether I pursue this project by myself or on behalf of the community I will need to conduct some interviews. Obviously, I would love to hear from some of the Core Team members who can tell the internal story, but I also think any member of this forum will have unique insight as to what they saw in Maker and how they\u2019ve experienced its evolution. So first step: is anyone reading this willing to arrange a time to answer some questions? COVID obviously dictates no in-person interviews, but I\u2019d be happy to conduct them over Zoom, phone, or even just emailing you a list of questions (though I do find we\u2019ll get to some more interesting stories with some real time interaction). My hope is project will get enough response to turn into a decent sized eBook and if there is community/foundation support I\u2019d be happy to do the project under their patronage. Is this a good or even new idea? Let me know if you have thoughts, stories, or even some places to start research (I read Zandy\u2019s Story last night, talk about drama). It\u2019s so neat to be apart of something still so new and fresh and I think if more people knew about Maker we\u2019d have the USDC market-cap eating our dust [some pun intended]. ",

I do know a few visual artists myself, but none of them are much into the crypto space (yet ). I\u2019ll see what I can do on that front. @Anna thanks so much for all the work you do, it\u2019s crazy to go from seeing you talk about things on a YouTube video to having you engage with my ideas in the forum, go DAO! My objective was to tell the Maker story, and the suggestion of a graphic series is so smart in terms of making something people not too familiar with crypto could actually engage with. I\u2019m thinking it does make more sense to go through the Community Development Portal and see if this is something the community wants to support, and if not, no worries as it\u2019s a great story I\u2019d still be pursuing on my own anyway. I\u2019ll poke around the portal today and see where I get! ",
