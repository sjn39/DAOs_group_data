Would be nice if providing liquidity with UNI would give some sort of token that has voting rights ? exemple you pool your UNIs, gets vUNI for that time being that exclusively can be used as a governance token ? Would that make sens? ",

                    "content": "I like this idea. Same could apply with deposited UNI (aUNI, cUNI). Ideally, a constant scan of UNI balances could determine the voting power of an user. To avoid \u201cbuy, vote, sell\u201d attacks, one could imagine that the UNI that are taken in account for a given vote are the UNI an user owned at a given time, x day/hour/block before the vote was proposed. I think Curve is using such a system. Maybe it could be improved, taking pooled/deposited UNI into account. I don\u2019t think governance should be financially incentivized, but maybe it should not be \u201cuncentivized\u201d either. ",
