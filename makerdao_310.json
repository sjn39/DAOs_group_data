                    "content": "Summary The trading terminal is the very necessary infrastructure that becomes the entry point to the ecosystem for new traders, users, and developers on it as a result. Working with data: aggregation, structuring and its visualization is an organic step towards mass adoption among future users of the ecosystem. Projects such as Kattana, working with big data, are able to provide any requested information and its variations at the request of third-party developers, which can be used to create new products/apps that will accumulate the required pace of MakerDAO protocol development as a whole. Proposal  Add Kattana cross-chain trading terminal to the MakerDao ecosystem Add the ability for developers to freely use trading data:   Trading charts in real-time for AMM (DEXs) (at the moment, Kattana works with DEXs on 6 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, HECO, Avalanche, and Elrond) Price feeds, liquidity, and the trading volume for tokens that are traded on AMM (DEXs)  to develop and optimize new and existing products Synergy Kattana is already very involved with the Ethereum chain and plans to develop new technological solutions on it even deeper. Collaboration can both speed up this process while also significantly improving the experience for MakerDAO ecosystem apps users. About Kattana Kattana is a cross-chain trading terminal for DEXs and CEXs. Working with Trading Big Data, Kattana gives users the ability to trade in real-time on over 40 DEXs across multiple networks, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, HECO, and Avalanche. Up to 24 charts on one screen, 3 types of limit orders, an AI-powered news aggregator, data analysis, and other innovative tools with the trading terminal of the future! Website Twitter ",

For example, Dai is already integrated with various DEX and aggregators like Uniswap and 1inch. And don\u2019t see why MakerDAO ecosystem should favor your project to be integrated on Maker dashboard. Also, why is such trading data important for MakerDAO ecosystems? There are already domain teams that work on relevant data (such as price feed for oracle). ",

                    "content": "Hey, thanks for the answer I would like to clarify the idea  Dai is already integrated with various DEX and aggregators like Uniswap and 1inch  This is a fact, but as you correctly noted, this is an example of DEX and liquidity aggregator. Kattana, in turn, is a trading terminal with its own ready-made infrastructure for data processing and visualization. On Ethereum network alone, Kattana records and processes more than ~1.2 million trade logs per day (for BSC, this value is more than ~2 times higher) Own infrastructure for data processing allows working with true values and quantities Example: Take a look at this token listed on PCS - Link  PCS info screen1954\u00d71506 178 KB  Screenshot from PSC Info Where 1 - Its token smart contract address 2 - The value of the liquidity size of this token on PCS (comparable to the capitalization of Bitcoin at the moment) (note: this value is obviously erroneous) 2 - Trading volume  Kattana Screen1596\u00d71050 67.5 KB  Screenshot from Kattana The data here is seriously different from what PCS shows. The critical importance of the truthfulness of data and their values is the number 1 priority when working with infrastructure products on the blockchain, and therefore Kattana approached this so globally. In conclusion The trading terminal is, first of all, accuracy and speed, this is the foundation for the further development of the ecosystem, I think that the proposal above can be considered at least reasonable  screen11908\u00d7931 122 KB  Kattana trading terminal (multicharts) ",
