Paragraph Summary This MIP sets up a SPF of 500k DAI which will fund the due diligence, completion, and ongoing management and monitoring of the following projects: MIP65, MIP81, MIP88, and potentially others brought for evaluation to the community where Monetalis will act as Arranger in the next six months. It allows Maker to continue key RWA projects in the interim period until MetaDAOs can be launched and allows the Maker Community to evaluate the work of the Viridian Cluster ahead of a potential adoption of the cluster to a Protector MetaDAO. Importantly, it also allows the resources of the Viridian Cluster to work on the Protector MetaDAO implementation.  Motivation We, the Viridian Cluster, believe it is key in the period until MetaDAOs can be launched that Maker does not lose steam in its engagement with RWA. This SPF is intended to allow the Viridian Cluster to accomplish a set of key Maker RWA projects that we believe are important for Maker\u2019s engagement with RWA. Also it provides essential resources necessary for implementation of the Protector MetaDAO format. In addition, we find it good people risk management to test out a potential MetaDAO Cluster before considering an adoption. This accomplishes all of these.  Special Purpose Fund Name Viridian Cluster Special Purpose Fund  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Credentials  Projects & Funding Break-down     Component Why? Amount (DAI)     Project Manager & Facilitator  @Hajive from MakerGrowth CU will act as the Project Manager & Facilitator for the cluster, whilst phasing out/reducing his Growth CU responsibilities for the European region through this period. Note: MakerGrowth CU will continue to fund the fixed component (not commissions) of DAI compensation and MKR bonus for this resource at least until Jun 23 as per its already allocated budget. 330,000 (total for three resources)   Legal & Compliance Lead  @Kam will, as contractor, act as head of legal and compliance for the projects.Note: @Kam has already been engaged on a project basis working with CUs as well as partner legal teams for legal assessments and reviews.

Notes   @SebVentures, as a Viridian cluster member, is already fully budgeted for via the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) budget and hence there is no additional funding requirement for this resource. The cluster will work in partnership with SF-001 and in support of SF-001\u2019s expanded mandate regarding RWAs.   Funding Return Rules  Excess funds will be held in the multisig until the work is complete. Unspent funds will be returned to the Surplus Buffer.

Maker intends for the initial MetaDAO admin teams to be fairly selected from among any potential clusters.  Do you not feel that specific clusters receiving funds from MakerDAO represents MakerDAO essentially picking winners? At the very least, it gives some clusters an advantage over others. If some clusters have been pre-funded by MakerDAO, I imagine I would rather use any MetaDAO tokens I farmed/bought/owned to onboard them as my MetaDAO admin team, than an alternative cluster that hadn\u2019t received prior funding from MakerDAO. Clearly they would be more favoured by MakerCore and therefore more likely to receive support moving forwards. If we\u2019re proposing funding clusters prior to their being onboarded to MetaDAOs, perhaps it should be done equally?  To be clear, this is not really a criticism of Viridian, or this proposal generally. My points are mainly:  Thus far everyone has been extremely careful to emphasize that MetaDAO token holders choose a cluster to onboard as their MetaDAO admin team, rather than it being a decision of MakerDAO. If certain clusters have been directly funded by MakerDAO, and the fruits of that funding will be reaped by MetaDAO token holders that vote to onboard that cluster as their MetaDAO admin team; then how is this not just Maker indirectly bribing MetaDAO token holders to onboard the clusters that MakerDAO favours?

I believe this portion of the SPF will be confusing to recognized delegates, including and not limited to Flip Flop Flap Delegate.

Is this SPF asking for a budget for members of the Viridian Cluster to perform due diligence and monitoring of their own members? The initial posting by the head of Monetalis lists Arrangers as being internal to the Cluster. Note that there is already a Cluster member monitoring the Cluster\u2019s own projects. It would be best practice to separate these roles. Perhaps Arrangers should not be internal to the Cluster, or the Cluster should not be requesting funds to due diligence and monitor its own projects. Looking forward to seeing how the discussion evolves on this. Thank you for bringing up these needs with plenty of time to land on a good solution! ",

If we wait for everything to be in place - we run the risk of losing the first mover opportunity that we now have in the RWA space ! Forgetting for a moment what the structure is, the reality is we desperately need to onboard more legal and credit expertise to fuel the momentum that is now starting to build with RWA and that is the fundamental objective of this SPF ; ie. making new and highly experienced legal and credit talent available to the DAO. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be achieved via this Cluster approach and could, for example, be done via onboarding new resources to the Strategic Finance CU considering their expanded mandate with regards to RWA. However we also saw the opportunity here to pilot the concept of a working cluster, consider it a launch or test cluster. Am sure there will be many valuable lessons from that experience which are better learnt at this \u201cproof-of-performance\u201d stage rather than after a big bang switch over at scale. ",

                    "content": "Maker cannot force the MetaDAOs to onboard a cluster, but a crucial part of the pregame is to ensure high quality clusters are available for the launch of the MetaDAOs. The SPF structure or using a core unit is the best way to allocate resources to this. Alongside the funding we also need to activate the recognized launch metaDAO cluster MIP to properly decide on how many MetaDAOs we will be launching (matching one launch metaDAO with each cluster). One more thing that\u2019s going to be important to properly support this process is to modify the SPF mip to better support the needs of clusters and ecosystem actors, while also specifying that cluster or ecosystem actor bootstrapping is the only valid use of SPFs in the pregame (and will be completely phased out post-pregame). Mainly I think what is missing the possibility of providing MKR rewards in line with what CU members are getting. I plan to make some proposals to this end in January ",

It\u2019s an edge case and perhaps unique to my situation where as an existing Growth CU contributor a large portion of my compensation is commission based. Therefore dedicating time & bandwidth to the cluster ends up negatively impacting my variable element of compensation. This SPF proposal seeks to find a compromise where I would not be financially penalized for dedicating time to the Cluster. ",
