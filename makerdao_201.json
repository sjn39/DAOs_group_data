                    "content": " Motivation I\u2019ve published the idea here. Most (all?) financial systems started with coins that weren\u2019t swappable at par but fixed this problem as it is much better to have the same unit of account. It\u2019s inspired by the Suffolk System which solved this problem in 1824. It was also suggested in The case for Clean Money, which is a good TL;DR of this Signal :    The case for Clean Money   To increase the growth of Dai, and to make it possible to properly compete with centralized stablecoins, the spread on the PSMs should be reduced to 0 so that Dai becomes a proper stablecoin with no problematic UX friction.   Bringing the ecosystem to have a mindset of 1 DAI = $1 will take a bit of time so it\u2019s important to start early (payment rails should be upgraded, broker-dealer so take it into account, other stablecoins protocols should join, \u2026). USDC is eating the on-chain volume market share and we shouldn\u2019t stay passive.  The second step will be when our balance sheet will be fully invested (RWA, bonds, institutional vaults, plenty in the works). Then we will be able to increase the DSR. DAI will be $1 but yielding a better rate than the fiat-backed stablecoin (that can\u2019t really compete). Reducing the USDC is another kind of problem and making it difficult to deposit USDC in the PSM is more adding friction to DAI than anything else (people want to own DAI but we tell them to use USDC instead or to pay a premium, paying a premium to lend us capital at 0% \u2026).  Pros  Stop making DAI holders pay I estimate that at least $6M are spend on stablecoin swap with DAI (only for LP fees). While this is good for liquidity providers (like me), this is clearly making our customer pay for using DAI. It\u2019s a tax on DAI adoption. This equates to 0.1% on bank transfers. While uncommon now in TradFi (I still have one bank charging 0.15%), this shouldn\u2019t exist at all in DeFi.  Simplify the perception of DAI Currently, DAI is a stablecoin which value is around $1. This would anchor the perception that 1 DAI = $1. DAI would simply be a dollar with a Maker logo on it. You could swap it for free for fiat-backed stablecoin and get $1 there.  Facilitate Real-World Asset lending DAI not being equals to $1 is quite an issue when dealing with RWA. This would significantly improve the value proposition. Some are going to go through Circle then pay the 20bps to DAI (PSM) to repay their loans. For 90 days invoice financing, that adds up quickly (almost 1% yearly).  Fuel the future DeFi repo market The SocGen deal is about creating a repo market in DeFi. The repo market is a short-term funding solution to provide liquidity to actors that have a temporary deficit in it. This works best if all the stablecoin are at the same price so the liquidity is merged (think of Aave when you lend/borrow any kind of \u201ctier 1\u201d stablecoin at the same rate). Even a few basis points is an issue as there is a lot of transactions.  Simplify future payment rails When I buy a $100 product on an e-commerce website, it cost me $100 no matter the bank I\u2019m using. A merchant will likely take USDC or USDP at face value but not DAI (with the exception of our shop). PS: Actually, I wasn\u2019t able to confirm what Coinbase Commerce is doing but I assume USDC is at face value while DAI is not.  Increase DAI presence in DeFi stablecoins Having a strong peg will force other stablecoins to fix their peg as well. They will be able to leverage DAI for that, hence lending capital to Maker at DAI interest rate (at max DSR so 1bps). Read more here.  It would be better for them to use DAI than USDC directly as it feels less centralized, less management is needed, and we provide an MKR backdrop.  Cons  Less revenues So far the PSM generated 4M of profit for the protocol.  Most of those revenues are generated when we expand DAI supply (or when we introduced PSM-USDP). In a stable environment, the fees from the PSM are below 5% of revenues.  Not great for Curve Curve is in the business of providing stablecoin swaps. We would provide a better alternative for DAI <-> USDC <-> USDP (assuming efficient markets). This might be an issue for their business model.  Increased exposure to USDC Such a move will be arbitraged by market makers with Curve. This might lead to increased exposure of 200M in PSM-USDC (thanks @Primoz). using 1inch to get more liquidity providers, the increase might be 250M. This should be solved by institutional vaults, RWA and, more precisely, by short-terms ETFs.   Should MakerDAO set tin/tout of PSM to 0%?     Yes, tin/tout to 0% for all PSM No, leave tin/tout as it is Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This signal request poll will run for the next 2 weeks, until Monday, October 25th. If a majority of forum voters (excluding abstain votes) are in favor, the proposed changes will be submitted for an on-chain governance poll the following week. ",

I believe this is the biggest way we are currently shooting ourselves in the foot on a daily basis when it comes to momentum and growth. 4 million in revenue, or whatever, is nothing compared to allowing Dai to be a viable alternative to USDC and other centralized stablecoins. There\u2019s also the context that a lot of large scale collateral solutions are finally seeing the light of day, like staked ETH, the direct deposit module for aave, and real world assets / backbone collateral such as corporate bonds, so the short term growth in USDC exposure should be seen as a positive rather than a negative, since it means more capital available at 0% cost that we can allocate to other assets and earn profits from. IMO we cannot afford to drop the ball on this so I will follow this up with a MIP that would allow MKR holders to have the final say on this, should the forum process block it. Again, this is the biggest way we are shooting ourselves in the foot on a daily basis - seeing Dai left out of solutions that include all other stablecoins, and also letting people think of Dai differently as simply a \u201cnot-quite-stable\u201d coin rather than a real 1:1 USD stablecoin. It is really a quantum leap in terms of Dais role in the market and we shouldn\u2019t let it be delayed longer than the quickest our governance processes will allow. as an example I learned a while back that most OTC desks have special markets they call 1:1 markets for stablecoins like USDC and other things where there is a 1:1 arbitrage available somewhere. Since Dai doesn\u2019t have the 1:1 arb, it doesn\u2019t get this kind of treatment and most OTC desks instead consider it a volatile cryptocurrency, using different, more complicated and more expensive processes to price it and make it available to their users. This has forced me to use USDC over Dai in multiple transactions in the past because it creates a significant friction and inefficiency, especially at larger scale. ",

This has forced me to use USDC over Dai in multiple transactions in the past because it creates a significant friction and inefficiency, especially at larger scale.   You are right, FTX has a deposit section called USD; where you can deposit USDC, TSUD, PAX or USDP, HUSD, BUSD and DAI. DAI is listed as a volatile currency, and it is surprisingly very expensive to withdraw DAI through that exchange. Like that, I am sure there are many more cases. 4 Million feels good and comes in handy, but we should always look to think ahead to what we want for DAI. We are looking for DAI to be the strongest and most solid alternative to centralized currencies, and also to be without a doubt the benchmark in terms of DEFI. I will vote YES, worth $4 million, when it is in our interest to position DAI as the most solid and robust digital dollar 1-2 years from now. ",

Maybe starting with 0.05% fee in, 0% fee out, and then reassessing for further reductions (potentially all the way to 0%) after a month. Another option we could consider is \u201ccentering\u201d the peg around 1% by reducing fee in but increasing fee out slightly above 0%. For example we could charge 0.025% for both fee in and fee out, which would result in a 0.05% spread / round trip fee from USD to DAI and back, but would create market conditions where the peg would trade right around 1:1 most of the time and never more than 2.5 bps away from peg (versus up to 10 bps off peg currently). This preserves our ability to earn some revenues from stablecoin swaps (maybe even growing revenues if we see a lot more volume), and also ensures we don\u2019t negatively impact Curve pools which serve as an important driver of DAI demand.

                    "content": "The fees in the PSM serve several purposes that keep the system from going off of the rails. The PSM module was deployed to help take on as only as many 3rd-party stablecoins as necessary to get Dai\u2019s peg back down to an \u201cacceptable\u201d level after a market downturn. It\u2019s stated purpose was to be able to take the hit from a market crash and get enough Dai on the market at a reasonable price to let vaultholders cover their positions. Moving the TIN to 0% means that we will take on to our books all of our competitors stablecoins until that market is completely saturated. According to the market, Dai is objectively more valuable than the other stables. I like to think it\u2019s subjectively because we\u2019re censorship resistant, but Dai\u2019s value will only equal other stablecoins when we\u2019ve cut enough corners on issuance to counteract it\u2019s real benefits vs. other stables. PE has been working for the last year and a half on various solutions to get USDC and other regulated stablecoins off of the books, and this does the exact opposite of that. Maker governors should be prepared to take on many multiples of the current portfolio regulated stablecoins if this is adopted. Having the PSM\u2019s full or at even greater percentages of Dai backing than what we\u2019re currently seeing is going to limit the appetite to take on more stables in a market crisis (when we need it the most). Without any spread, there\u2019s no limit to how much stable risk the protocol takes on, and zero friction for anyone looking to pass that risk to us. We would be taking on blacklist, technical, and insider risks for 0 premium in an environment where we absolutely can and should expect to be rugged on these tokens. This is a short-term fix that exacerbates a long-term problem. There are also potential legal considerations around this change, which is why the Foundation did not want to touch the PSM. I\u2019d strongly recommend getting a legal core unit to weigh in on the implications here. ",

I would feel more comfortable seeing a clear method to sterilize the counter party risk larger amounts bring to our portfolio first (likely bonds or other fixed income that scales safely).

Finally, regarding market share, yes, we are losing out to USDC but in a twisted way, we are losing out for good reasons! As Brian points out, the premium on DAI is not an accident - it clearly shows that users prefer it precisely because it is not backed by a centralized entity. Throwing away those fundamentals to increase short-term market share doesn\u2019t seem like the best move to me. ",

I believe the 250M figure is based on the DAI currently available to sell on DEX platforms for over $1 (of USDC or USDP). This amount would probably be filled immediately because it represents risk free arbitrage. But we may also see greater demand for DAI if it trades at a 1:1 price beyond this - in some ways this is the point of lowering PSM spread to 0%, it increases DAI\u2019s utility for RWA, OTC trading, and other use cases.

DAI is now more backed by non-stablecoin assets than before this move and within the stablecoin backing, we are seeing USDP take over from USDC. This move to remove the tin completely torpedoes those efforts.   We have had this problem for more than a year now. One year ago the stablecoin ratio was 53%, it\u2019s 56% now. We kept market share. Regarding the tail risk of USDC, no fees can compensate for that. Taking 20bps or 0bps is quite the same when you lose your principal. The last published solution to solve USDC exposure was gelato USDC <-> DAI where we have all the protocol risk (105% LR is not helping). We can still send those PSM stablecoins in DeFi protocols and achieve similar results. DAI being more valuable DAI > $1 can be seen as people wanting DAI because it\u2019s better. Yet, we have only 5-6% of market share and not growing above-market growth. Most new stablecoins are above peg mainly for farming (directly or indirectly). There is an inherent link between the yield you can achieve and the stablecoin buy pressure. I wrote about it last year and while the theory was not fully fleshed, it was kind of correct. The interest rates are now quite in line between USDC and DAI on Aave. This means that people don\u2019t care much about DAI or USDC, they care about the yield. More precisely yield + stablecoin risk. It\u2019s difficult to analyze in detail as some players might be delta hedged (debt in DAI ~ asset in DAI so insensitive to DAI price). Impact on stablecoin exposure The $250M figure is coming from 1inch, how much DAI you could get with a risk-free arbitrage USDC <-> DAI (the PSM). Could there be second-order effects? Sure.     monet-supply:  ensures we don\u2019t negatively impact Curve pools which serve as an important driver of DAI demand.   We have close to $600M DAI on Curve. Let\u2019s assume it no longer make sense to swap there, and they all look for yield in another stablecoin, the net impact might be up to -$350M USDC in the PSM. We might be able to do the same thing with D3M (depressing DAI yield on Aave to make people move to USDC lending), but the farming incentive makes things less simple.

The Curve pool is not a bucket that we can reach into and swap $250mm in liquidity out of to get the price to peg. The price on Curve is more akin to a tidal watermark. $250mm represents a single swap which will get Dai price parity for a block or two, but which will quickly be refilled from arbitrage trades coming from every other exchange on the market. We\u2019re not looking at bailing out the Curve pool to get to peg, we\u2019re looking at bailing out the entire DeFi market. So far we\u2019ve taken on 3 billion USDC to get the Curve balance from about an $800mm difference last year to the $250mm difference now. As we get closer to the peg the liquidity gets deeper and it requires us to take on increasingly more USDC to reduce that spread. Our 3 billion USDC represents the long tail pricing that gets us to the price that we\u2019re at now, but that\u2019s small change compared to what it\u2019s going to cost to hit true market parity. Unrelated, I\u2019ll add that from a vaultholder perspective, generating Dai in the traditional (revenue generating) way is very expensive in gas fees, even for large amounts. The handful of extra basis points on the market can somewhat help in the recovery of those costs and reduce the cost of vault ownership. By further dampening the benefit of generating Dai in favor of these risky and unprofitable solutions we continue to discourage vault ownership, which is still the bread and butter of this protocol.

I really don\u2019t like the argument that because massive USDC exposure is bad then we should shoot ourselves in the foot and deliberately damage Dais position in the market as a stablecoin. If that\u2019s the way we wanna go, why not just shut down the PSM entirely and turn into rai? It\u2019s not like the 4 million in income per year does anything to protect us against the hypothetical blacklisting risk of USDC, and similarly its not like having 3 billion vs 6 billion USDC makes a difference. In both cases it\u2019s a fatal exposure. Why do we want to hurt ourselves if it doesn\u2019t actually help us in a meaningful way? This is really Makers biggest achilles heel: getting stuck in a spiral of self-flagellation where we are shooting ourselves in the foot on obvious decisions that anyone else would be able to get right, but we faceplant on them so we can pat ourselves on the back and feel like we are being \u201crisk averse\u201d even though we aren\u2019t because we are refusing to move forward so we can deal with the problem at its root. Choosing growth and accelerating forward actually provides us with a real, proper, long term solution to the problem of overexposure to stablecoins rather than half measures like shitty UX-destroying fees. We can solve the problem of USDC exposure without also punishing our users. Most of all, having a huge amount of USDC accumulated in the short run will act as a big, flashing beacon to all the potential RWA providers out there, proving to them that Maker has a lot of very scalable business to offer and this will help them muster the massive motivation they will need to jump through all the hoops and barriers to set up proper scalable and secure RWA facilities. The larger Maker is, the more Dai there is in circulation, and the better Dai is as a product, the more likely we are to attract the kind of high powered partners we need to place 100s of billions of future collateral in globally diversified bonds and sustainable and resilient flagship projects outside the US. I am working really hard trying to get these kind of deals set up, but they are very complicated and it takes a lot of luck and effort to get it done. It sucks to put in all that effort if the DAO is also meanwhile making things harder by choosing to have Dai be a worse product for crypto insider virtue signalling reasons (when it doesnt actually solve the problem!). It just makes it more difficult to explain to potential partners of the future why we are a rational and reliable partner they can count on to help their business thrive and survive. In the grand scheme of things, in terms of exposure and in terms of where the project will be 5 years from now, 3 billion USDC or 6 billion means nothing, and there\u2019s no difference between the two, so we should just choose growth and focus on real, endgame solutions rather than half measures. The other massive possibility having a 1:1 PSM opens up for are direct deposit modules that have a simple PSM integration allowing them to deposit large amounts of Dai that gets converted into USDC at a 1:1 rate into aave and compound. We could potentially deposit all 6 billion USDC or however much we will end up with in this way, within a very short amount of time. ",

It seems we should keep the Maker mission in mind as we decide these key strategic issues. \u201cThe mission of the MakerDAO products and the Maker foundation is to create an unbiased currency for the world, which of course means for everyone all across the world.\u201d I believe this means we want to develop a GLOBAL unbiased currency, where Maker becomes the dominant (or at least a key) stable coin worldwide and can be easily used by anyone.  So we need to design a stable coin that has broad appeal across the world.  Thus what key features does THE stable coin need to have?  I strongly believe that two key features are mandatory:   Folks want frictionless transactions:  thus no transaction fees.   Folks want value stability:  thus minimal \u2018bank run\u2019 risk   The Maker folks have built something wonderful here and created alot of value.  But there is still a long way to go before making Dai a global unbiased currency.  This audacious goal cannot be achieved without taking risks.  A low risk strategy at this point would result in Maker being a niche success, at best.  Being true to the mission requires taking risks to build a better, more appealing stable coin and in turn significantly increasing Dai usage. I just dont see how maintaining transaction fees helps us achieve the audacious mission\u2026 Lets stay big and bold in our vision and execution ADDED LATER: The market structure and economics of stable coins is iimportant to issues such as this.  Do stable coins have INCREASING RETURNS TO SCALE?  Basically this means that for a given stable coin its marginal costs of production decrease as their volume increases for all volume levels.  For Maker that would imply that creating/servicing the 100th Dai would be cheaper than the 99th, and the 1,000 Dai would be cheaper than the 999th and so on. Search engine is a typical example of a business with increasing returns to scale.  Once Google builds their search engine, the marginal cost of servicing additional customers is very low & and the development costs per customer fall as they are split across a larger group of customers. If stable coins have increasing returns to scale, this implies the industry should become a natural monopoly or at least an oligopoly (a few huge players) at scale, tending towards a winner take all industry.   I suggest that stable coins ( and digital currency) do have increasing returns to scale.  I also suggest that stable coins have network effects which means that the stable coin becomes more valuable to a customer as other customers adopt it.  Products with network effects such as Facebook tend towards monopolies as well. Here is my main point:  assuming that stable coins have economies of scale and/or network effects, the stable coin market at scale will have only one or a small group of huge competitors.  Thus there is a race to scale to become one of the few winners.  Slow careful growth will be quite risky as it allows as other stable coins scale more quickly than Maker. QUESTION:  do folks believe that stable coins have economies of scale and/or economic network effects?  If so, Maker needs to prioritize rapid growth.  (I didnt say reckless growth - one might suggest that Tether is growing recklessly) ",

Given that the current USDC on the balance sheet is already fatal, there\u2019s no difference between a little bit fatal and a lot fatal. We should maximize the benefit we get from having USDC on the balance sheet. By setting fees to 0, we can suck up USDC into the protocol like a Dyson. This serves multiple advantages.  A hard peg at $1, which has multiple tangible benefits around integrations, RWA, and marketing. The more USDC we have, the more drypowder we have for re-allocating that USDC into whatever configuration we want our balance sheet to look like.

It is much easier to offer fixed rate vaults, liquidity mining, invest in ETF bonds/RWAs and so on if you know that you won\u2019t need to immediately start thinking how to decrease DAI supply if for some reason stablecoin backing decreases to lower levels. It seems part of the community is still confused about \u201ctoo much USDC\u201d narrative and I do understand it, because at the same time we are making efforts to decrease or hedge USDC exposure: lower rates, G-UNI LPs for blacklisting reasons, diversification with different PSMs, generous fixed rate vaults and many other attempts to boost supply from non-USDC collateral. But in reality we are mostly switching 0 yield USDC collateral to something more yielding and this is actually a good problem to have, unless you are very worried about holding USDC right now. We are probably talking about <10% increase in PSM which won\u2019t change things much risk wise, but yes it might have negative PR for those who still look at the USDC backing narrative differently.

The USDC we receive immediately produces some profit, the profits generated can be used to buy back ETH, wBTC or even DAI. It builds confidence for investors because it diversifies us, it builds confidence for those who are against USDC being in our system and at the same time it can protect the system from overexposure of USDC in the long run.

Centralized stablecoins in Maker were introduced as an emergency measure after Black Thursday, where we had dai liquidity crunch due to how the old liquidation system worked. Today dai premium mostly exists due to how price is defined inside AMMs and the ever growing amount of USDC and other centralized stablecoins in the crypto economy. Additionally dai is more valuable because of unique features and advantages over centralized stablecoins. During a large market crash event, demand for dai suddenly increases which could result in higher to normal premium, where current PSM parameters prevent the large premium, without accumulating excess reserves when that is not crucial. We went from high LR stablecoin vaults, to low LR stablecoin vaults, to PSM with fees and now we are possibly going to complete USDC=DAI PSM. PSM was introduced as a mechanism to prevent large premium of dai but suddenly we are discussing it as a mechanism of acquiring reserves, which can later be deployed into different assets or to achieve yield or a mechanism to pump supply of dai artificially. I think this is a completely different strategy as PSM and stablecoin vaults were introduced for. This strategy should first be exactly defined and accepted by the community and not \u201csemi-forced\u201d upon with changes to mechanisms, which can be irreversible later in time. Defining and agreeing upon this takes much longer than it takes us to lower PSM fees. Under current strategy and market conditions, slight premium is not problematic for anyone, but RWAs and can even be an incentive to issue debt from crypto collaterals. So before we exactly define what the future strategy is, I don\u2019t think we should prematurely decrease the PSM fees and subsequently increase USDC reserves. From the risk perspective, this would obviously lead to an increase of risk. I believe that zero fees could potentially increase the USDC in reserves for much larger amounts than a few hundred million, especially as USDC and other stablecoin supply continues to grow. ",

                    "content": "Upon more thought, I think this is not the right move for Maker at the moment. Field Technologies will be voting against this when it appears as a poll this week, but is open to considering it again in the future. Reasoning number one: Not all stablecoins have the same value (which is the whole reason the PSMs exist). With regards to DAI, it has several features that make it a better medium of exchange than other stablecoins \u2013 namely the inability of Maker to implement capital controls such as freezing, burning, blacklisting, etc; also it has marginally lower gas fees associated with its use. This is not dissimilar to gold coinage in pre-modern times. A useful analogy is with European medieval monarchs, who did not actively source precious metals to mint coins, but instead allowed private actors to bring bullion to their mints and pay a fee (similar to our \u201ctin\u201d parameter) to melt down the bullion into standardized weights and purities that were easier to transact with (coinage). DAI\u2019s position is similar to that of those old gold coins, and USDC, USDP, and any future stablecoins are similar to gold scrap or bullion that private actors want to convert into currency for lower friction transactions. I don\u2019t see an obvious reason for DAI to prop up a discounted price of centralized stablecoins more than is absolutely necessary, and the 10 bps tin has served Maker well historically. This small amount of friction also leaves room for AMMs to still function profitably elsewhere, which further reduces Maker\u2019s risk of an individual blacklisting event. Note that stable-stable LP tokens are an increasingly successful form of collateral, and generate fees while still exerting some non-real-time pressure to stabilize the DAI peg. Reasoning number two: This is one of the very few monetary policy levers that Maker has available to pull (and it\u2019s a fairly small one). Maker is a price-taker with regards to stability fees and size of its monetary base, and this toll is similar to the medieval minting fees referenced above. It allows for some (small) control over size and composition of our monetary base and dollar-proxy reserves. The success of the diversification of USDC to USDP is a clear example of the value of this tool. This tool does demand, however, that our tin/tout policies serve no other masters (like revenue generation or strategic initiatives to position Maker as the source of stablecoin-stablecoin liquidity). Reasoning number three One of the major (but not mentioned that I\u2019ve seen anywhere?) benefits of setting all tin/tout to 0 is to reduce the risk of hedging on the part of RWA/fixed income counterparties for whom even a small deviation in DAI<>USD peg can be significant due to the scale of transactions being proposed. This is a real concern, but probably easier to hedge on Maker\u2019s side by simply allowing a way for debtors to repay in USD rather than DAI should DAI deviate beyond an acceptable exchange rate band with the dollar. In my mind, this was the most compelling reason to adopt a 0 tin/tout parameter, but is most easily hedged on behalf of those for whom it matters with other solutions that don\u2019t affect the total flows of stablecoins in and out of our reserves. Following this line of reasoning, I have also begun a Signal Request to set the USDC-PSM tin to 10 bps (and make no changes to the USDP-PSM). ",

Price of a stablecoin shouldn\u2019t be in nominal term but in interest rate. We should be quantity elastic and price inelastic. The fact that DAI is preferred over other stablecoins is a myth until proven otherwise. First, the market cap show that USDC, Paxos (incl. BUSD) and even USDT are still winning. Second, due to the nature of curve, the 3pool should be split between assets at par. So with a $6B 3pool, you have not much of the market cap on USDC and USDT but 25% of the DAI market cap which adds a buy pressure for purelly technical reasons. As some people are delta hedged on DAI (borrow + lend somewhere) and therefore not impact the price, this is even more than 25%. USDC is currently more valuable than DAI on Curve as the share of DAI is at an all-time high. Now you pay only 2bps (meaning a price of DAI before fees of 0.9998).  image1194\u00d7566 45.6 KB  Therefore we already passed our arbitrage price from 10bps to 2bps. There was an argument that decreasing it would increase exponentially the amount of stablecoins on our balance sheet. Well, the opposite happened. You can argue that there was a lot of minting against crypto for sure. You can also argue that as we decreased our stablecoin exposure, people started to see DAI as less attractive (correlation is not causation).  image810\u00d7395 19.5 KB  For reason #2, I would cite that 2 rivals in Scotland were able to accept notes at par 300 years ago. The fuel of MakerDAO is DAI issuance and investing this float. We can control by DC and by changing the tin/tout at some point if necessary. But at least one tin should be 0 and one out should be 0. Then the market-making can do the rest. For reason #3, it was voted against by a poll last year. Moreover, this is adding quite a complication and make DAI less suitable to be the stablecoin of the RWA financials markets. ",

In general, I think much of what you\u2019re saying is true, but simply disagree upon whether a commitment to make major stablecoins fungible is worth what Maker would give up. Namely, a small tool to guide composition of our dollar-proxy reserves, and the potential to make stable-stable pools less profitable after Maker has been successful in attracting Uniswap and Gelato stable-stable LP tokens as collateral. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any kind of disaster to set tin/tout of all current and future PSMs to 0. I just don\u2019t want to risk losing the ability to encourage diversification between PSMs or risk reducing collateral that helps maintain the peg indirectly (but keeps blacklist risk at arm\u2019s length and generates revenue).
