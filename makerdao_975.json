                    "content": " Summary:  Twitter has underperformed the S&P 500 since 2013 by % (you would have made a fortune on longing S&P and shorting Twitter) Elon Musk is, newly, the largest shareholder of Twitter, inc. at nearly 10% If from 2013 to today you\u2019d longed Musk\u2019s Tesla and shorted Twitter that spread trade would have made you % (an even bigger fortune) On April 13th, 2022, Musk made a tender offer at $54.20 per share ($43B) to take Twitter private Musk\u2019s stated goal is to open source Twitter for the purpose of safeguarding free speech For that, we propose on-chain governance for Twitter Twitter is the town square of Web3 and many other communities This signal request asks: Should Web3 and MakerDAO consider providing debt financing to Musk for such a leveraged buy-out? If so, what terms should Web3 demand as a lender? [remember the golden rule: He who has the gold makes the rules.] Below are the facts, why this matters, and proposed terms for a hypothetical debt facility with $500M in anchor funding from MakerDAO (super-senior secured and with Musk\u2019s personal guarantee) and the Delaware statutory trust for Web3 to effectively acquire Twitter so that an open source Twitter protocol can emerge. The alternatives:  Elon acquires Twitter but fails to do a Web3 integration Twitter fends off his bid, remains independent, and continues to languish at the center of the culture war Another acquirer emerges: Google, Disney, Comcast, or a Saudi Prince who likes to dismember journalists for speech he doesn\u2019t like   We are in a culture war between centralized elitists who don\u2019t believe in free speech (feel threatened by free speech) and decentralized populists who want to retain our First Amendment rights   Informal Poll:    Should MakerDAO establish a free speech trust (Delaware) for the benefit of Web3 and Twitter Users, to Finance Elon Musk\u2019s Purchase of and Open Sourcing of Twitter?  YES work on a MIP for debt financing Musk and Web3 open sourcing Twitter, inc. as Twitter protocol, a public good for messaging/communication YES work on a MIP and I am willing to co-author it or co-sponsor it NO, STOP THIS NONSENSE     0 voters      Musk\u2019s Offer on April 13th, 2022: \u201cBret Taylor Chairman of the Board, I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company. As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced. My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder. Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it. /s/ Elon Musk\u201d  Facts:  Twitter is an iconic asset; it is the town square of Web3 and many other communities Twitter is inundated with spam and bots It is struggling with how to safeguard freedom of speech The assets of the company are woefully underexploited and mismanaged The current share price is roughly the same as it was in 2013 (while SPY has gone up and to the right violently, Twitter has not). Twitter could be used to onboard millions of users to Web3 via the adoption of a governance token with on chain governance and by integrating crypto wallets for user authentication Musk has the resources to acquire Twitter and demonstrably Musk is a champion of free speech Musk has a track record of building best in class products and growing his companies exponentially Musk has a track record of actually open sourcing valuable IP such as Tesla patents Musk asserts that \u201cI don\u2019t care about the economics at all.\u201d implying that Musk would be amenable to capped upside for him, with excess value accruing to the users of Twitter (the \u201cTwitter Community\u201d)   Technical Implementation:  MakerDAO\u2019s portion of funds can come into the real world by the creation of a new vault with $500M debt ceiling and a MIP21 secure conduit to the Delaware statutory trust (using a licensed broker-dealer intermediary for the swap of Dai to USD)   RWA Legal Structure:  A Delaware statutory trust for the benefit of Web3 and Twitter users A \u201cFree Speech Trust\u201d as a vehicle specially designed to support open sourcing most of Twitter and safeguarding our first amendment right to freedom of speech   Lender Participants:  MakerDAO as an anchor $500M of super-senior secured debt Other DeFi lending protocols like AAVE, Compound, Uniswap, etc. if these protocols are so inclined to be lenders (they have enormous unused treasuries) Other Qualified Purchasers Others, as possible in compliance with the law, who want to lend to Musk and govern a Twitter Protocol   Proposed Terms of Debt:  Senior secured debt cross collateralized by a personal guarantee from Musk 25 bps over 30 day SOFR Governance: Musk to vote his % of ownership but a maximum of 10%, with participants in this Delaware trust and Twitter users to vote the other 90% in on-chain governance Open source terms: All code that can be open sourced without violating user privacy must be open sourced, with on chain governance Crypto wallets (e.g. Metamask) must be integrated for user authentication Musk to be capped out at profiting beyond a Twitter having a valuation of $69.420B, with the remainder of Musk\u2019s future profits distributed (e.g. airdropped) to Twitter\u2019s human users   Open Sourcing Twitter and Launching Twitter Protocol on Web3. Ideas:  All algorithms posted to GitHub Everything that can be published to GitHub under the law should be Make it know what code is being run in production Give a community of governance token holders the ability to make changes to the code being run using on chain governance Governance by tweet? Progressively migrating servers to Web3 Allowing users to export their social graph and Tweets Giving user\u2019s ownership of each of their Tweets as an NFT Labeling users as human or bot Sybil resistance Gas charges to reduce spam Metamask integration as login with an NFT for each account Multi-chain integration including Arweave integration   What\u2019s at stake: Free Speech  Our First Amendment rights are at stake   Investment Bankers for Musk:  Musk has engaged Morgan Stanley as financial advisor.   What we should expect from Musk:  From time to time, Musk may engage in discussions with the Board and/or members of the Issuer\u2019s management team concerning, including, without limitation, the Proposal, potential business combinations and strategic alternatives, the business, operations, capital structure, governance, management, strategy of the Issuer and other matters concerning the Issuer. Musk may express his views to the Board and/or members of the Issuer\u2019s management team and/or the public through social media or other channels with respect to the Issuer\u2019s business, products and service offerings.   Regulatory & Reporting:  If Musk\u2019s Proposed Transaction is completed, the Common Stock would become eligible for termination of its registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Web3 requires that Musk keep the same reporting standards as a public company, to the extent doing so does not hinder the ability to open source Twitter as a communications protocol public good under the stewardship of the American people   Why take Twitter private, and wen token(s)?  \u201cTwitter needs to be transformed as a private company.\u201d - Elon Musk The advantages to going private are less regulatory overhead, and so on\u2026 The pitfalls are\u2026 (?) The plan: use six months as a private company to consider token(s), economic design/mechanism, copyleft vs. copyright, stewardship of this digital town square and communications protocol public good, and how we get the Federal Government of the USA seeing this phenomenal opportunity to again lead the free world Goal of aligning shareholders interests with that of the network user   Big Hairy Audacious Goals:  Launch a minimum viable protocol for governing on chain in two weeks or less   Musk\u2019s Tender Offer Proposal is non-binding  and, once structured and agreed upon, would be conditioned upon, among other things, the  (i) receipt of any required governmental approvals; (ii) confirmatory legal, business, regulatory, accounting and tax due diligence; (iii) the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements providing for the Proposed Transaction; and (iv) completion of anticipated financing   Next Step if signal passes?   @maxglass will lead the drafting of a MIP6 real world asset onboarding. The collateral shall be held in a Delaware statutory trust or other vehicle best suited to steward this public good protocol until it is sufficiently decentralized (see Nakamoto Coefficient by @balajis)   TwitterDAO Anthem, a cover of ENS DAO Song A Day:  ENS DAO cover song   Sources:   The SEC filing of Musk\u2019s ownership: 9.2% or 73,486,938 shares of Common Stock out of 800,641,166 shares outstanding as of February 10, 2022 Musk\u2019s tender offer SEC filing Elon at TED 2022 Analysis: The All-In podcast episode 76  A sampling of the scary reactions from media and intellectuals that are pro-totalitarianism and anti free speech:  https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1514578609754812419 https://twitter.com/maxboot/status/1514570168730636290 https://twitter.com/DefiantLs/status/1514738236207337477 https://twitter.com/auronmacintyre/status/1514653963408318474   Glenn Greenwald  \u201cThey have somehow inverted history so that they now believe that it is not censorship that is the favored tool of fascists, tyrants, and authoritarians \u2013 even though every fascist and despot in history used censorship as a key means for maintaining power \u2013 but instead believe that it is free speech, free discourse, and free thought that are the instruments of repression.\u201d       Excerpts of Transcript of Musk at TED 2022  Elon from 11:26 it\u2019s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech where\u2014 Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square. So it\u2019s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law. So one of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to people\u2019s tweets, if they\u2019re emphasized or de-emphasized, that action should be made apparent so anyone can see that action\u2019s been taken so there\u2019s no behind the scenes manipulation, either algorithmically or manually. I think everyone will still blame me for everything. Yeah. If I acquire Twitter and something goes wrong, it\u2019s my fault. A hundred percent. I just think it\u2019s important to the function of democracy. It\u2019s important to the function of the United States as a free country and many other countries and to actually help freedom in the world and more importantly in the US. And so I think the civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of Twitter as a public platform. the intent\u2026 it\u2019s definitely not from the standpoint of let me figure out how to monopolize or maximize my ownership of Twitter, what I\u2019m saying is this is not a way to make money. It\u2019s just that my strong, intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don\u2019t care about the economics at all. In my view Twitter should match the laws of the country and really there\u2019s an obligation to do that. But going beyond that and having it be unclear who\u2019s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what\u2019s going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous. the code should be on GitHub. You know? So then, can look through it, and say, \u201cI see a problem here. I don\u2019t agree with this.\u201d They can highlight issues, suggest changes, in the same way that you update Linux or Signal or something like that. I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things, just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts I think are better than permanent bans. I think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible. And a good sign as to whether there is free speech is if someone you don\u2019t like allowed to say something you don\u2019t like. And if that is the case, then we have free speech. And it\u2019s damn annoying when someone you don\u2019t like says something you don\u2019t like. That is a sign of a healthy, functioning free speech situation. I think it\u2019s very important that the algorithm be open sourced and that any manual adjustments be identified. So if somebody did something to a tweet, there\u2019s information attached to it that that action was taken. And I wouldn\u2019t personally be in there editing tweets. But you\u2019ll know if something was done to promote, demote, or otherwise affect a tweet. As for media ownership, a share ownership structure that will have Mark Zuckerberg the 14th still controlling those entities\u2026 We won\u2019t have that at Twitter. a top priority I would have is eliminating the spam and scam bots and the bot armies that are on Twitter. They make the product much worse. If I had a Dogecoin for every crypto scam I saw, I would have a hundred billion Dogecoin. I think you\u2019d only have the edit capability for a short period of time. And probably the thing to do upon the edit would be to zero out all retweets and favorites. I\u2019m open to ideas, though. I\u2019m literally on the toilet or something like, \u201cHa-ha, this is funny.\u201d And then tweet that out. That\u2019s like most of them. Sure, I don\u2019t like to lose. I\u2019m not sure many people do, but truth matters to me a lot, really. Pathologically, it matters to me. The obsession with truth is why I studied physics, because physics attempts to understand the truth of the universe. Physics, it\u2019s just what are the provable truths of the universe and truths that have predictive power. You make a triangle with 42 degrees and two 69s. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect triangle. Or is there? Yeah. I have a proposal for a worldview or a motivating philosophy, which is to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe and to agree that we expand the scope and scale of consciousness, biological and digital, we will be better able to ask these questions, to frame these questions and to understand why we\u2019re here, how we got here, what the heck is going on. That is my driving philosophy, is to expand the scope and scale of consciousness, that we may better understand the nature of the universe. I think we want to obviously do our absolute best to ensure that the future is good for everyone\u2019s children, and that the future is something that you can look forward to and not feel sad about. You want to get up in the morning and be excited about the future, and we should fight for the things that make us excited about the future. There\u2019s got to be things that get you excited like you want to live. I love humanity and I think that we should fight for a good future for humanity. I think we should be optimistic about the future and fight to make that optimistic future happen.  Excerpts of Analysis from David Sachs on the All-In Podcast Episode 76.0: David Sachs: we have to look at the track record of this management team, which it barely exists, but also this culture at Twitter. This is a company that\u2019s languished for years, a decade. This culture has been so inept that in response to Elon\u2019s takeover offer they gave all the employees a day of rest. The employees were so stressed out they told them to stay at home and take it easy. This team is weak, soft, and Elon would give the whole company an enima and fix this thing, and that is why they don\u2019t want him taking over. That is why you should not let this board and this CEO invoke some magical plan that they don\u2019t have, that they never came up with because it\u2019s just a big excuse so they\u2019re not out of a job. What is this story really about? It\u2019s about free speech. He said this is not about economics for me. Twitter needs to be the open town square, it is the marketplace of ideas. We\u2019re going to make it a free speech platform. We are going to open source the algorithm so people know when they\u2019re being canceled they know why they were taken down. Is that algorithmic, was that a human intervention? This is what it\u2019s about for you all. This is also what it\u2019s about for all the elites, for everyone observing it, criticizing it. Look at the reactions the hysterical reactions. Business insider \u201cElon Musk\u2019s attempt to buy Twitter represents a chilling new threat: billionaire trolls taking over social media.\u201d so these guys are completely hypocritical Jeff Jarvis Tweet https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/1514578609754812419 Somehow these people think that the reinstitution, the restoration of free speech is somehow like the end of Weimar Germany. Max Boot Tweet https://twitter.com/maxboot/status/1514570168730636290 In the warped mind of these elites and the corporate media, they think that for democracy to survive they need more censorship. Chamath: Objective fact: Twitter has the same stock price while the rest of the S&P has gone absolutely up and to the right in a violent manner. Whatever has happened here inside this business has not been working for nearly a decade. Devil I don\u2019t know will be better than the devil I do know. Sachs: Play for a bigger bid\u2026 run an auction\u2026 No principal agent problem in that context (decentralized) Put it to a vote and let every single shareholder decide Limits on ability for Elon going on the market and buying more Friedberg: Really important from corporate governance Job of board is to look out for interest of shareholders particularly minority shareholders Is there upside for the smaller shareholders Chamath What also works Do the right thing Get a fairness opinion Goldman is probably doing it as we speak When you factor in the market beta today Path to a bigger outcome? Board will have of justifying the alternative of not taking this Alot of shareholders want to get out. Vanguard has to own through these ETFs How many concerned interested shareholders are there Friedberg What about Jack who owns 2% Jack is on the board Jason: Twitter 2021 $5B, 8,000 employees $625K per employee Google: 135,000 employees, 257B, $2M per employee Sach Refuses to be CEO saying \u201cI\u2019m a VC now. C\u2019mon. I\u2019m done operating companies. I\u2019m sick of it. I don\u2019t like doing real work. I\u2019m too old.\u201d Chamath: Had previously tried to takeover and do David as CEO Sachs: Startups are like the NBA I\u2019m retired. I\u2019m the coach. Sachs: On the ground. Plug in there. Project Manager or Product Manager A deep bench Elon is the new GE Jason: AI team on self driving If he took one person They\u2019d solve the bot problem the spam problem in 3 days Sachs: He\u2019d get rid of the bots The sight would be cleaner It\u2019s also an ideological battle or struggle The big struggle of our time is populist vs. elitist Elon is one of the rare billionaires that\u2019s anti-elitist Somehow the elites are in favor of censorship To protect their control over democracy They\u2019re greatly outnumbered The more democratic this county becomes The more they are going to lose power and be kicked out So fiercely resisting the restoration of Twitter as a free speech platform It means the end of their cultural power Chamath: Tweet that encapsulates it to a T @axios tweet: The world\u2019s richest man \u2013 someone who used to be compared to Marvel\u2019s Iron Man \u2013 is increasingly behaving like a movie supervillian, commanding seemingly unlimited resources with which to finance his mischief-making. Are you serious? Jason: That\u2019s journalism? Chamath: This is the same guy doing more on climate change, and has been doing it for 20 years before it was popular, and satellites, and space travel, and I think if he does get a control of Twitter and there is a strong reliable moral force for free speech then that will be his greatest contribution to society. We want this political philosophy of democracy and capitalism to roughly work together and I think it sits on top of this fundamental idea that you can say what you think without fear of retribution and it\u2019s only there that you can seek out different opinions and \u2026 without such a high cost for making mistakes. Jason: Elon Musk spends a significant portion of his fortune to restore trust in public square by open sourcing the API and allowing transparent moderation That\u2019s what he said in his Ted Talk Sachs: Look at the hysterical reactions A supervillian in their eyes because he will give right to free speech back. Today the press doesn\u2019t believe in free speech Greenwald excerpt: They have somehow inverted history so now they believe it is not censorship tha is the favored tool of despot \u2026 free speed, free discourse, that are the instruments of oppression. Their cultural power. Predictions: 30 days from now, what is your majority case, what happens? Sachs: Elon thwarted Corporate media, political elites, and the board Either the poison pill will win and stock will be in the dumps and the board members sued Or they find a buyer for Twitter another buyer at the same or greater price and in the hands of another company who they regard as safer because that company is bought into the regime of censorship Google? Comcast? Lina Kahn We will find out how rigged and how deep the corruption goes! Friedberg: Board of rational actors\u2026 High integrity Wants to see Elon get it. A rational view on moderation. He\u2019d be excited for Elon It\u2019ll be a multi-month process and Elon will go do something else Chamath: 30 days to 90 days from now Nobody wants to buy this dumpster fire Corporate boards and companies and CEOs don\u2019t have the stomach for that First they\u2019ll reject it (not in the fiduciary best interest of shareholders) as a sign of ego not logic. By saying it, look, whenever there\u2019s a merger announced Merger Arbitrage. Alot of people believe the board is not going to do the right thing Sachs: The fix is in Chamath: The money good thing to do is to buy that equity to bleed into the acquisition price. The board is going to reject the offer.  Episode 2: Sachs: intellectually confident, don\u2019t believe in shutting down the debate. Lost the art of persuasion. \" Jason: \"They\u2019ve given up trying to reach\u2026\u201d ",
