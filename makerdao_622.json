Out-of-scope bugs 10853 & 10860 (both reported by the same whitehat) Snowflake Credentials Leak resulted in a bounty payout of 2000 DAI   Bug 11789 from last month is still under consideration. DUX provided proof that two bugs from last month (11314 & 11424) were already known weaknesses. These bugs were closed with no payout. Bug 11644 was deemed incomplete and invalid. Out-of-scope bug 12019 resulted in a doc fix and payout of 250 DAI   Bug 12767 is open, waiting for additional clarification from the whitehat reporter.   Given the DAO\u2019s flat power structure, Core Units cannot compel other Core Units to do anything. However, we would be derelict if we kept silent while critical infrastructure remained unprotected.  Nik from Oracles and I had a meeting at the end of 2021. I recall letting him know that he could join whenever he wanted. That was pretty much the last time that I heard from him. I followed up on the #oracles-public Discord channel in Feb and Jul 2022. No response. I followed up in a DM in Sep. No response. During the Oct 25 Mandated Actors meeting, where Nik was in attendence, I briefly reviewed the bug bounty program and asked when Oracles would join. No response. There are legitimate reasons not to prioritize joining a bug bounty program. However, not being willing to communicate those reasons seems unprofessional. Since ISCU is powerless, but cannot remain silent indefinitely, we ask MKR holders and their delegates to decide what to do about the situation. @Recognized-Delegates    In a step toward decentralized front-end hosting, ISCU posted a link to the PSM front-end hosted on Swarm.

We have introduced a bug bounty amendment to allow more flexibility in scope.   Our amendment to enable Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties passed To facilitate different escalation protocols, smart contract and website vulnerabilities will be separated into two separate bug bounty programs.   Tips for working with the bug bounty program  Always use the Immunefi Dashboard for communications. Respond within 48 hours for Critical and High severity bug reports. A simple confirmation that someone is looking at the report will suffice.   Try to close medium/low severity in 7 days and high/critical severity in 14 days. If you know that you will need more time, ask for it. Hackers are generally understanding, but appreciate advanced notice. Don\u2019t try to negotiate severity or bounty amount with the hacker. Coordinate with ISCU.   If anything needs to be changed with the bug bounty program, let us know. Provide feedback. We\u2019re here to make the process work.

From experience I can tell that handling inbound vulnerability reports can be time-consuming and frustrating, because of the following reasons:  The time-sensitive nature of such reports require direct response, which disrupts my own working process. Involved direct communications with external actors that are financially motivated to have their requests classified as high as possible, which tends to lead to unreasonably long (and frankly; frustrating) discussions Handling the vulnerability reports and performing triaging myself requires a deep understanding of the Immunefi x MakerDAO bug bounty program, as well as specific technical knowledge which I personally lack and requires involvement of the engineers in my team (of which the capacity is already too low in my opinion)  I would personally hate to see the frequency of inbound reports rise because of reduced involvement of IS-CU, as it will directly impact my productivity overall. Then again, I\u2019m fully aware of the need to reduce spend in the DAO and would be happy to comply with the suggested changes.     psychonaut:  If the number of bugs becomes unmanageable then we can contract with Immunefi Services Triaging to resume.   I will do my part by raising my flag in case this situation occurs and I feel it would be appropriate to revisit this decision. ",

The payment amount was reached after mediation from Immunefi, which took into consideration similar accepted bug reports across other projects, both within and outside of Immunefi. This was a web/app bug and I\u2019d like to thank both DUX and GovAlpha for their time and patience on the matter as well as the feedback provided to further improve the process, as well as the whitehat who submitted the bug report. Due to the circumstances around the bug report and its improvement on the process, Immunefi has decided not to charge its fees (10% of the reward amount) for this bug report. Additionally, though it was not mentioned in the Medium article, 5570 will not have the Immunefi fee charged in addition to the IS-001 Facilitator relinquishing some of the compensation of their salary.

                    "content": " From experience I can tell that handling inbound vulnerability reports can be time-consuming and frustrating, because of the following reasons:  The time-sensitive nature of such reports require direct response, which disrupts my own working process. Involved direct communications with external actors that are financially motivated to have their requests classified as high as possible, which tends to lead to unreasonably long (and frankly; frustrating) discussions Handling the vulnerability reports and performing triaging myself requires a deep understanding of the Immunefi x MakerDAO bug bounty program, as well as specific technical knowledge which I personally lack and requires involvement of the engineers in my team (of which the capacity is already too low in my opinion)  I would personally hate to see the frequency of inbound reports rise because of reduced involvement of IS-CU, as it will directly impact my productivity overall. Then again, I\u2019m fully aware of the need to reduce spend in the DAO and would be happy to comply with the suggested changes.  Thanks @0xdeniz for the feedback here. To clarify though, IS-001 will still be doing the initial filtering. On top of that Immunefi has developed an improved automated spam filtering system so spam issues will be reduced overall. It is still likely that overall bug reports will be escalated a bit more than normal, but overall it shouldn\u2019t increase to as if there was no filtering whatsoever. I can also share that Immunefi Services is looking into managed triaging for web and I\u2019ll try to get this to be rolled out ASAP. Unfortunately though, this will be a time-restricted service. However, I will seek feedback before implementing this once we get the costs worked out.  I will do my part by raising my flag in case this situation occurs and I feel it would be appropriate to revisit this decision.  Thank you.  I would second these points. Arguably it would impact security of the system if the triaging process becomes dependent on the timely reaction of CU members. Is it possible to reduce the fee in order to maintain only the triaging service?  I should be able to get a final quote from the managed web service by tomorrow. However, the managed smart contract triaging won\u2019t be provided. One additional piece of information that was shared during the call last week was that Immunefi Services was actually operating this so far at a loss. We had hoped that this would not be the case, but unfortunately this is what ended up happening due to scaling issues as well as resource forecasting mistakes. Simply put, running a 24/7 premium triaging service with smart contract and web/app triaging was not economical at these rates. However, with further restrictions to just web and perhaps a certain time restriction on that, we can likely keep it still to the point of overall reduction on the costs. ",

                    "content": " We seem to have arrived at an agreement with MKR holders to reduce our minimum spend to 8k per month and reduce services.  Immunefi Services has indicated to ISCU that it will be ceasing its service with regards to the operational audit due to resource constraints. As such, this service will no longer be provided by ISCU. Immunefi Services however has indicated that no charge will be levied given that no value was provided. We will return 90,199 DAI back to Maker by sending this amount to the auditor wallet.      @TravinImmunefi attended DAIvinity Amsterdam and reported his findings to the Events CU. This work, however, was incorrectly executed with a mistake; Travin informed Sam MacPherson (@hexonaut) about his intention to audit the event under the mistaken impression that Sam was a member of the Events CU. Hexonaut did not misrepresent himself. Travin just failed to make the proper checks to ensure that he was communicating with the right person. Other missteps were also done by Travin during the documentation phase. We apologize to @PonJerry and @Leggevents. Reimbursement for the trip will not be provided by ISCU to Immunefi Services due to no to little value being provided. This month 14 bugs were submitted through the bug bounty program.   A whitehat reported a low severity vulnerability that was verified by @tadeo. Since bug 8826 was outside the scope of the bug bounty program, ISCU declined to pay a bounty. However, Data Insights CU decided to pay a small bounty to encourage whitehats to report such findings.      The first fire drill was finally conducted.  Gas used to participate was refunded.  We are currently running two follow-up polls:  What is a good frequency for fire drills? (Quarterly is leading) Should we incorporate fire drill participation into the Recognized Delegate compensation performance modifier? (Yes is leading)   The winning choice was no change in the poll to change the GSM Delay. No further action will be taken as this time. This seems reasonably justified considering the prompt action demonstrated by Recognized Delegates in a recent emergency and the first fire drill. DeFi Safety is exploring how to pitch a new security offering. We hosted a  brief presentation that was not recorded. Rex promised to refine his proposal and continue the discussion in the forum. There was a recent informal poll that asked whether to disable the Emergency Shutdown Module. We think that it is a serious concern that anybody would even consider this course of action. In reaction, we have prepared a new page for the manual that summarizes the material covered in the forum thread. Your comments and feedback are welcome.

No bugs were escalated to Protocol Engineering.   Five reports were alleged website vulnerabilities. Two bugs, of Critical and Medium severity, were verified and fixed. One report is still in discussion and the rest were found invalid by the Immunefi Services Triaging team.   Oops, @psychonaut incorrectly invited ChainSecurity to evaluate Immunefi bug 5700, a website vulnerability. ChainSecurity is only expected to evaluate smart contract vulnerabilities. This bug should have been escalated directly to the responsible Maker Core Unit.

There was a misunderstanding about how MakerDAO smart contracts are secured. Rex from DeFi Safely had worked out some procedures to verify the set-up of multisig wallets. Rex\u2019s use of the term fire drill referred to the rapid exercise of a multisig wallet. It was believed that some critical smart contracts were secured by multisig wallets. However, the reality is that all critical smart contracts are secured by the MKR voting system.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Can you please expand more on how your team will work w/ChaosLabs   My understanding is that ChaosLabs will make it easy to spin up a MakerDAO system in a test environment.

Our goal was to shield PE from the tedium of triaging.  This should not be a surprise because we wrote in our budget that, \u201c[ChainSecurity] will provide final triaging services for smart contract bug reports.\u201d We budgeted up to $10k per month for ChainSecurity. Our activity will not affect PE\u2019s auditing budget. Now, nothing is set in stone. Maybe PE can do this job less expensively or maybe it\u2019s a useful activity for training new engineers or maybe PE wants to own triaging for some other reason. If there is consensus then we can change the process.  In terms of cost, the budget for PE seems to suggest that the base salary for engineers is around $400k. This works out to about $200 per hour. I don\u2019t happen to know offhand what ChainSecurity charges; I bet they are not cheap, but PE time isn\u2019t cheap either.  ",

As stated by Joshua, the MIPs indicated the process of having ChainSecurity looking at the bug reports for smart contracts before escalating to the steward core units, which in most cases would be PE unless there\u2019s another core unit coming up in the future with their own smart contracts that IS-001 determines as critical infrastructure to the MakerDAO ecosystem. Since we didn\u2019t get any feedback about this process other than requests for clarification during the MIPs for the creation of the core unit or MIP64 itself, we thought that it was okay. I also mentioned this during one call with ChainSecurity where someone from PE was present, though this was a few months ago so I understand if that was forgotten, especially since it was also not the main topic of the call. We were very much willing to hear feedback and modify the process proposed back then and as Joshua mentioned, we are also very much willing to change the process now, so I\u2019m more than happy to get on a call to discuss further. A few other comments though:   The \u201cUp to USD 10 000\u201d budget is just the maximum IS-001 can pay, though there\u2019s also the contingency on top of that. We don\u2019t assume this will be exhausted every month, but we have it in place as Immunefi\u2019s experience is that bug reports come in waves. Additionally, this budget covers Incidence Response assistance if their help is deemed necessary. If 0 ChainSecurity hours are used, then IS-001 pays USD 0.   The current process for smart contract bug reports of which PE is a steward core unit is Bug Report Submission \u2192 Immunefi Services Triaging \u2192 ChainSecurity \u2192 PE. We can also discuss on the call if the removal of Immunefi Services Triaging is warranted. I should mention that there were a few bug reports submitted as well that Immunefi Services Triaging rejected. I can go over them more on a call and I can even add you to those reports if you\u2019d like to review if you\u2019d like that filtering service or not. Let me know and I can add you to those before the call.   I\u2019m OOO for the next few days but we can have a call early next week. We\u2019ll reach out to you directly on Discord to set up a time. Our next office hours is scheduled for a time suitable for those in and around PST so we\u2019ll need to set up another time. ",

Some Core Units, such as Sidestream and TechOps, will likely continue to operate on remaining funds despite their Nov budget rejection. However, we do not think the same approach is suitable for Immunefi Security because our modest mandate update was also rejected. The bulk of our remaining funds are earmarked for rapid bounty payouts; in deference to MKR holders and with an abundance of caution, we are eager to return all excess funds to the protocol to preempt any speculation that funds might be misused, EtherScan. We think it is prudent to require an affirmative vote by MKR holders to continue operations. For us, the most disturbing aspect of our budget rejection was, during the RFC period, the lack of feedback on the forum. We did receive some guidance in vote justifications. It is clear that ISCU needs to evolve into an Ecosystem Actor. Although @psychonaut has admittedly expressed intense skepticism about some aspects of the EndGame plan, this is not a hill that we need to die on. We are ready to evolve and become EndGame compliant. Since it is not clear how to become an Ecosystem Actor, we plan a MIP55 SPF to provide six months of bridge funding to keep the lights on while the EndGame plan is fleshed out. Since 24k MKR voted for Approve reduced budget - BearMarket, we will probably request 6600(6 months)(1.1 contingency) = 43560 DAI. If voters regard this post as a pre-RFC and provide feedback, that would be welcome. To build the case for approval of our request, we will contact our internal customers and solicit recommendations.  This month 19 bugs (IDs 12928\u201313984) were submitted through the bug bounty program.    Bugs 11789 and 12767 from last month were found invalid.
