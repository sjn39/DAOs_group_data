It is a pioneering tool in web3 end-to-end testing with the potential to evolve into a decentralized network of test runners and continuous integration providers in the future. Synpress is easy to use, fully tested, and includes features such as MetaMask support, headless mode, integrated video recording, and many more. It is also blazingly-fast and extensible, with the ability to add custom commands and plugins. Synpress is already used by several open-source repositories. Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?:   Addressing a need: There is a growing need for a reliable and efficient testing framework in the web3 dapp space. With more and more applications being developed using blockchain technology, there is a need for a tool that can handle the unique requirements and complexities of these applications. All existing solutions are either using mocks (which is not true e2e) or are deprecated/not actively maintained.   Improved testing efficiency: Traditional testing methods can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially when testing complex web3 dapps. Synpress can help automate the testing process, which can save time and resources, and also reduce the likelihood of human error.   Increased adoption: As more developers and organizations begin to adopt blockchain technology and develop web3 dapps, the need for reliable testing tools will only increase. If Synpress can offer an easy-to-use, efficient, and reliable testing solution, it could attract a significant user base.   Competitive advantage: Being an early mover in the web3 e2e testing space could provide a significant competitive advantage. By offering a tool that addresses the unique challenges of testing web3 dapps, Synpress could establish itself as a leader in the market and be part of the core stack for developers.   Is your project likely to bring new builders to Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: End-to-end testing capabilities of this tool could make it easier for developers to test and debug their dapps, which could result in fewer errors and faster development cycles. This could make it more attractive for builders to develop on Optimism network, as they can be confident that their dapps will work as intended. In the end, having a tool like Synpress could lead to an increase in the number of builders and dapps on the network. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: By providing a reliable and efficient way to test dapps, Synpress can help to improve the quality of devs in Optimism ecosystem by enabling them to build more reliable and high-quality applications. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Synpress helps to reduce the workload for developers by providing a fast and reliable testing framework that can easily integrate with MetaMask, which makes it easier to develop and test in Optimism ecosystem. By automating much of the testing process, developers can save time and focus on writing code that adds value to their dApps. Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Demo: E2E Tests for Web3 Applications by Rafaela Azevedo - GitNation (starts from 14:40) Website: GitHub - Synthetixio/synpress: Synpress is e2e testing framework based on Cypress.io and playwright with support for metamask.  Twitter: https://twitter.com/synpress_  Discord/Discourse/Community: Synthetix  Github: GitHub - Synthetixio/synpress: Synpress is e2e testing framework based on Cypress.io and playwright with support for metamask.  Other: @synthetixio/synpress - npm   Do you have any metrics on the project currently? (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):  5k+ weekly downloads on NPM  2+ years in development (500 PRs, 330+ GitHub starts, 20+ Contributors)  Who are your competitors?: There is only one competitor that is worth mentioning (and I\u2019m aware of): https://github.com/ChainSafe/dappeteer Other solutions have not been maintained for a long time and are simply not working. What differentiates you from your competitors?: Synpress is built on top of modern and powerful e2e testing frameworks like Cypress and Playwright, while its competitor Dappeteer uses Puppeteer. Synpress offers the advantage of letting users choose their preferred framework (Cypress or Playwright), has better support for features present on Metamask, and is more mature and advanced tool with a wider selection of features present out-of-the-box. Additionally, Synpress has a different vision for the future, aiming to be a wallet-agnostic, decentralized e2e testing provider that allows tests to be run in a decentralized way by utilizing a decentralized cloud of e2e runners. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Yes, as synpress is an e2e testing tool, it can be composed with any dapp built on Optimism network. Team Who are your founders?: My name is Jakub (solo founder), I\u2019m a passionate QA Engineer/SDET and Core Contributor of Synthetix. I have around ~9 years of QA experience (~4 years in web3 ecosystem) which includes ~7 years of experience in different types of automated testing (mostly e2e for web and mobile, API & performance testing) and DevOps (CI/CD/TestOps and \u201cautomate everything\u201d style) and around ~2 years of experience in infrastructure. I\u2019m also very into web security and an active member of ISSA Poland since 2019. I have done many different things and personal projects throughout my life. I was able to create a few bots for different games with whole infrastructure on Firebase and cross-platform mobile apps for remote bots management using Apache Cordova. Also created two different closed-source e2e testing frameworks based on Selenium (old times, while I have been working at web2 companies \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af) which had to suit needs of my clients. Contributed to open-source e2e testing frameworks like webdriver.io, Protractor, nightwatch.js, SwiftMonkey and Detox. Other than that I have used many different QA and automation tools over my entire career for web/mobile/desktop automation and testing, but I don\u2019t really want to bore you there.

To see even more details about roadmap and future of synpress, feel free to check out project on GitHub: Synpress \u00b7 GitHub Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to revocation of remaining grant rewards.  PoC for CI platforms and e2e testing frameworks: This is a critical milestone because it is the primary use case for Synpress. Demonstrating the ability to work with different CI platforms and e2e testing frameworks will be crucial to showing that the project is capable of delivering its intended functionality. Wallet-agnostic: Rebuilding Synpress to support wallets as plugins is a critical milestone because it will enable the project to work with a wider range of wallets. This is important because different users prefer different wallets, and having support for multiple wallets will increase the user base and adoption of Synpress. Framework-agnostic: Rebuilding Synpress to support most popular e2e testing frameworks is also a critical milestone because it will make the project more versatile and adaptable to different testing needs. This will be particularly important for users who already have a preferred e2e testing framework that they want to use in combination with Synpress. 100% coverage of metamask features: This is a critical milestone because Metamask is the most popular wallet in the web3 ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to ensure that Synpress covers all of Metamask\u2019s features so that users can seamlessly test on it and be sure that their dapp users will have no issues. Foundry integration: Adding the ability to easily mock contracts while running e2e tests will be crucial for users who want to test their dApps in a simulated environment. This is a critical milestone because it will make Synpress a more comprehensive testing solution. Wallet mocking: The ability to mock wallets allows developers to simulate different wallet scenarios and test their DApps with various edge cases, without having to use actual wallets or real funds. This can save time and reduce the risk of costly mistakes during testing. More user-friendly: Making Synpress easier to use and set up is a critical milestone because it will reduce the learning curve and increase adoption. A user-friendly website and clear documentation will be important for attracting new users and ensuring that existing users continue to use the project.  Optimism Relationship Does your project solve a problem for Optimism ecosystem?:. Synpress solves a significant problem for the ecosystem - testing dapps can be challenging due to the lack of reliable and user-friendly testing tools. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: I think that synpress offers a valuable proposition for Optimism ecosystem by providing a much-needed testing solution for dapps, which can ultimately lead to a more robust and thriving ecosystem. Why will this solution be a source of growth for Optimism ecosystem?: With the rapid growth of the DeFi industry and the increasing number of dApps being built on Optimism, there is a growing need for reliable and efficient testing tools. By making it easier for developers to test their dApps on Optimism, Synpress can help drive growth and adoption of Optimism ecosystem. This, in turn, can lead to increased usage and value for the network, as more developers and users are attracted to the benefits of using Optimism for their DeFi needs. How committed are you (and your team) to building on Optimism?: Fully committed. Is your project Optimism Native?: No. Confirmations I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: [Yes/No]: Yes I understand that I will be expected to following the public grant reporting requirements outlined here: [Yes/No]: Yes ",

Yashwant key@forwardprotocol.io L2 recipient address: 0x182CebAB47af1302F39A3dE67dA8BA3945341690 Which Voting Cycle are you applying for?: Cycle 11 I confirm that I have read the landing pages for the Builders  and Growth Experiments  Sub-Committees and that I have determined my proposal is best suited to be reviewed by the Builders Sub-Committee: [Yes/No]: Yes Project Details What are you going to build?: Forward Protocol is WordPress of Web3.0. Users with zero technical knowledge can build and deploy full-stack dApps in very little time and minimum cost involved with an easy-to-use, drag-and-drop no-code interface. These dApps can be deployed directly to Optimism. Blockchains and subnets can also be deployed through Forward so the OP SuperChain would be a great addition when integrated in future updates. Forward has an open marketplace where developers can build or upload their templates and set their own fees and monetization structure. Languages which we support are Solidity, with Rust and Move coming soon. Python, Go and Move are also on our roadmap.  ForwardFront-end1920\u00d7946 72.5 KB  Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?: Building and deploying dApps takes time, money and technical expertise. With Forward\u2019s no-code drag-and-drop interface anyone can start building a full-stack dApp and deploy it to Optimism instantly. The open Forward Marketplace allows developers to upload their own templates for non-technical users to use. This simplicity is what every project and chain is looking to have and it\u2019s essential for Blockchain as a whole to succeed. Forward is also able to build custom templates that can be used by your community to deploy dApps directly to Optimism. If Optimism has a specific area of focus to grow your ecosystem, we can build it. Or run a hackathon to the Optimism developer community to crowdsource templates.  Forward Marketplace1280\u00d7797 67 KB  Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, because anyone can sign-up and join Forward to deploy a full-stack dApp and deploy directly to Optimism using the no-code interface, similar to WordPress, Wix and Canva. Users can also access the 12+ pre-built full-stack dApps for free, that are already in the Marketplace and supplied by Forward. It will bring in actual businesses and deploying users, not just builders. Builders from other ecosystems can now use Forward to monetize their creations for users looking to deploy on Optimism. Real utility is being created here. All users attracted to Forward from all our other marketing efforts now have Optimism as an option to deploy for them. Is your project likely to improve the quality of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: With competition, yes. With more developers joining the Forward platform and uploading their templates, the quality of templates will improve due to competition as the focus is for non-technical users to use. So the developers will start making more customisable templates and those with more features for wider use cases. There will also be the ability to audit templates through the Forward ecosystem which will tackle security and safety concerns of the templates being uploaded. Is your project likely to improve the commitment of developers in the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, because developers can set their own fee structure and monetization of their uploaded templates. So the more deployments and usage of their templates will increase their revenue potential. There is a real business use case for uploading templates to be used. With increasing competition and revenue comes focus on quality, support and commitment.

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): No current metrics yet, as we were in Private Alpha and just launched our Public Alpha. Who are your competitors?: https://thirdweb.com/ https://moralis.io/ https://www.starton.io/ https://www.settlemint.com/ https://simbachain.com/ https://www.cookbook.dev/ https://enzyme.so/ https://www.quicknode.com/ https://www.lokicode.io/ What differentiates you from your competitors?: We have done a very detailed competitor analysis. Let\u2019s discuss Moralis, Alchemy and similar platforms - they are developer assistant tools to help developers, they are not built for the end users with a zero code solution, so people could use Moralis and Alchemy to build applications, and put it in the Factory to scale to a non technical audience. Forward is meant for the end user with a drag and drop no code application. The dApp functionality is live, and in the next few months we will be going live with being able to deploy a complete blockchain, subnets and nodes. Then they can use the Forward validator marketplace to hire a validator. There are a few projects that compete with Forward when it comes to node deployments. An example is Quicknode, but they allow projects to create nodes in a centralised fashion. Forward is completely decentralised where it\u2019s not Forward who is adding packages/templates, but the developers with their own fee structure. There could be 100\u2019s of different developers competing and having their own customized images, versions of blockchains, different consensus, node setups and structures. All of that is open, we are an open marketplace, where we\u2019ll be transparently showing what is the number of deployment, reviews and ratings for users to make the best choice for themselves. One of the other differences is that we use an EIP2535 at the heart of Forward Protocol. This allows a developer to update a specific function, they don\u2019t have to update the whole contract, and they can push updates allowing a user to choose if they want to accept the update or not, just like WordPress where you get \u201cupdate your plugin now\u201d. This can be used to update contracts facet by facet, function by function, unlike a traditional proxy with a micro update functionality that will not only work for dApps but will work for blockchains too, which essentially means blockchains don\u2019t need to fork, they can run updates without forking because of this unique diamond implementation which has never be done before at a blockchain level. Will your project be composable with other projects on Optimism? If so, please explain: Yes, developers that upload their templates can add composability to their smart contracts and templates which can interact with other Optimism ecosystem projects.
