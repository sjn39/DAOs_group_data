To help ensure that there\u2019s cohesive decision making, and less deliberation. Protocol Goals // Random examples to articulate my point // Short term (<18 months) : \"We are prioritizing  new CDP creation  from unique wallets, as opposed to growing the market cap of Dai. We feel that planting this groundwork while we\u2019re still early from McD, and collateral selection remains to be finalized, the most value is to bring more and more CDP\u2019s into the picture. In the future, this base has better changes to be more distributed in accessibility. Some markets can appreciate it much more, and the more knowledgable and active CDP users there are, the faster we get to reach these markets that can take advantage of it. Medium term (3-5 years) : \"We wanted new CDP\u2019s at first, because that was to plant a base of educated users, that will help others understand faster, while also having a large count of CDP\u2019s can allow for a broad distribution where Dai can be drawn down. Long term (5-7+ years) : Create a global currency that is supported by the participants and not a select few. Ensuring stability, borderless distribution. Delivering much needed financial services, for underbanked in established economies and unbanked in 3rd world countries. Decentralized, distributed, borderless. Fair. Full post here ",

Rune has said in a recent youtube interview that The Foundation made a evaluation-mistake. Initially (at launch, late 2017), it was thought that there would be a lot of demand for DAI, the stable coin. Instead it was realised that the real demand is for CDP, meaning that DAI is mostly used as a margin-trading tool. --> This is reflected in the current SF at about 20%. Now, with this said, and taking into consideration the fact that MKR-holders are happy if a lot of DAI are paid in fees, why are you focusing on boosting the \u201csmall fishes CDP\u201d, instead of simplifying and allowing big whales to use CDP as a strong, decentralised, margin-trading mechanism?
