                    "content": "Overview A proposal has been put forward to offboard the Real World Finance (RWF-001) Core Unit. Since early August, the facilitator has been moving to divest the core unit of its responsibilities under various MIPs and oversight frameworks. The RWF-001 Operational Wallet still holds 575,875 DAI, and the co-signers of the multi-sig lack the explicit authority to halt the disbursement of funds. Since the conclusion of known work in July, two monthly disbursements totaling around 227,281 DAI have been sent off-chain through the service Accountable (or similar). Previous core unit offboarding precedent suggests all funds in the operational wallet are available to the core unit until offboarding. Therefore, additional guidance from governance would be needed to block use of remaining funds in the RWF Operational Wallet. Proposed Actions Given the intervening time since the last known work of this core unit and the unknown levels of its current staffing, this signal request proposes to instruct all signers of the RWF Operational Wallet (0xD1505ee500791490DE8642353BA6A5b92e3550F7) to cease all transactions until the author of the current RWF-001 offboarding proposal communicates an intent to withdraw, or the end of the October monthly governance cycle \u2013 whichever occurs first. Any legitimate winding down or accrued expenses are recommended to be submitted via signal request, accompanied by the appropriate documentation. Pros Prevents the possible misuse of up to 575,875 DAI Cons May disrupt payment of legitimate winding down or previously accrued expenses    Temporarily Freeze RWF-001 Operational Wallet?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     This poll will close on 2022-09-26T00:00:00Z Next Steps If successful, a poll will be presented on-chain for approval by MKR holders. ",

This SR gauges community sentiment towards temporarily freezing RWF-001 Operational Wallet. It is a binary poll with voting options: Yes, No, and Abstain. Specifically, the passing of this Signal Request will result in an on-chain poll which upon passing will \u201cinstruct all signers of the RWF Operational Wallet (0xD1505ee500791490DE8642353BA6A5b92e3550F7) to cease all transactions until the author of the current RWF-001 offboarding proposal communicates an intent to withdraw, or the end of the October monthly governance cycle \u2013 whichever occurs first.\u201d Given the potential urgency of this signal, GovAlpha approved an expedited duration of one week instead of two. For further info, please refer to @prose11\u2019s comment  This Signal Request will run until September 25, 2022 at 23:59 UTC. If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes are in favor of this proposal, it will go on-chain as a poll on September 26, 2022. Should this proposal pass on-chain polling, signers of the multisig will be informed of its passage and will be required not to sign further transactions until the end of the October monthly cycle, or the stepping down of the RWF-001 Facilitator @williamr. This SR has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Updated Sept. 19th. Thanks @blimpa and @Gala ",

I trust the DAO does not expect me to pay for all remaining wind down activities out of my own pocket. I\u2019ve got contractual obligations that I need to honour. And honestly those contractual obligations were already reviewed at the time that the MIP process was announced, way before the time the community has heard about it. @GFXlabs this post puts unnecessary uncertainty into an already willingly wind down process. Therefore this is pure harassment. Shall I amend my contractual obligations for payments to contractors so they go after @GFXlabs for their money for work provided? ",

Will reviewed his plan to provide documentation around the deals that RWF completed. We agreed that at the end of Sept CES would get a first look at the documentation and final delivery on or about Oct 24th. Given the scope of the work presented by Will, my opinion is that the work looks to be very useful for ongoing collateral management of the RWAs and supports the work CES is currently doing. I support paying people for their work. It\u2019s highly unlikely Will is doing anything lacking integrity with RWF funds. Sure, the communications could have been better. We can debate on what things costs or decisions people make but a facilitator is such until he/she isn\u2019t. Will shared he had a new team on his RWF office hours and made it clear that he was no longer interested in being a facilitator. If there was grave concern at that time, the community had every right to post a SR immediately. Educating the community is a key part of any transition. As a suggestion, maybe @williamr can post a short transition plan/costs over the past few months so everyone can understand the details. This is about communication. ",

The Maker DAO itself cannot make binding legal agreements, and The RWF core unit and others may have to engage in longer-term commitments in order to properly operate (or at least, in practice, this was the model so far)  The relative safety of the operational wallets is the buffer that allows core unit facilitators to take a certain degree of risk in the face of a very unpredictable Maker governance. With the introduction of external signers, or by putting the protocol as the beneficiary, this safety is already undermined to a degree. For Maker governance to interfere now and cast doubt over the coverage of the winddown costs is to send a clear message to future participants that Maker cannot be relied on and that, indeed, a core unit should be strictly operated as if all funding can be withdrawn on a very short notice. Maybe this should be the case anyway for prudent operations\u2026 it is probably a good rule of thumb. But this poll will make it more difficult to find people who are willing to stick their neck out for Maker or take risks based on their belief in the project. A call for greater transparency and more communication would, in my view, be more appropriate. ",

Given the offboarding request is the dominant MKR holder in most votes and the clear intention of the facilitator to accept the offboarding, it is simply bad business to continue to entrust 575k DAI to a core unit that has been given effective notice of termination. This signal is meant to align MakerDAO with basic best practices in business, and will be repeated for any outgoing core unit that has such large sums of funds.     williamr:  There are 6x headcount   This is news. If you have this many staff, we encourage you to include their salaries in a signal to exempt funds from this freeze. If community members choose to defeat this signal for a temporary freeze (requiring DAO approval to make further withdrawals) then that is the community\u2019s right. GFX will not actively campaign for this, and brought the signal because it is a common sense, typical business practice and the financial strain of even half of these funds being spent on a core unit that has already pushed legal expenses onto another core unit is material. Governance is free to disregard basic business practices, however. Thank you in advance to everyone who has or will vote. ",

It could create unpredictable risk around future offboardings or CU changes. Keep in mind the offboarding vote hasn\u2019t even happened, RWF is an active core unit right now. That being said I think it is important we minimize the expenses we pay to RWF beyond what\u2019s legally required by Will and his company and then the standard 3 month severance proposed for all the offboardings ive made. If RWF is doing any active work right now we need to ensure it is done only based on some kind of demand or need somewhere else in the workforce. There is zero reason to spend budget just for the sake of spending it obviously - but this signal request is not a good way to deal with this problem ",

Unfortunately a lot of this spend has already been committed to, but if the work is stopped now that will salvage us the 75k projected spend for the 3 weeks of October. To me it is clear that we want to focus on saving money in this situation. As a result I will modify the RWF offboarding MIP to the make the golden parachute contingent on not spending any additional funds beyond the minimum required to close out legal costs, saving us the 75k, and contingent on handing over all critical internal RWF documents to Strategic Finance and Growth, so that they can keep them safe and hand them over to future RWA teams. I am currently working on the final edits to the various MIPs in RFC and as a part of that process will also put these changes in place. ",

                    "content": "Let me share some thoughts with the community on what I think works and not. It\u2019s important for the community to provide feedback and even take actions like SRs in specific situations where there is ambiguity or concern for the protocol. For this particular situation, the issue was, what is the RWF CU spending their budget on in the past few months? There was confirmation on the signers of the ops wallet as several delegates reached out to me (and @Nadia). As a signer on the wallet, if suspected anything out of the norm, I would not have signed @williamr transactions. What works is for the community to ask for specific answers to the questions on the work being performed by the RWF CU. In a prior comment on this post, I thought I was clear on the value of the work the RWF CU was providing. While it\u2019s not my responsibility to defend the work Will is providing, I think my opinion as the facilitator of CES should be weighed heavily. Now @rune steps in and this entire exercise turns into a clear example of micro-management. There are 100\u2019s of details that are managed with our collateral at this very moment. I do not expect anyone to understand most of them. There are a lot of plates in the air at any one time and we (just not CES) do a great job keeping things running. What doesn\u2019t work is to get quarterbacked by people who aren\u2019t aware of the down/cross stream impacts by saying, let\u2019s stop work or send what you have over here or there. Delegation is only powerful when you put competent people in place and trust the work is getting done. Let me give you one very small example. Some of the work we completed with the RWA deals is under NDA. By sending critical documents to groups without a signed NDA is a violation of the agreement. It\u2019s a detail that is quite important and one that someone not involved with the day to day details might not be aware of. As a reminder to the community, CES is providing business continuity by managing collateral details that will be transitioned at the appropriate time when the governance process is certain. For example, if the end game MIP set passes, we will work with the interested parties to develop a transition plan which would include the process behind vault adoption. It\u2019s highly likely that a proposed vault adoption MIP would give the directive for the vault adoption. We would still need to work through the 100\u2019s of details to make that happen since we\u2019ve never done this before\u2026or any of the things we are setting up with the end game. It would be easy to underestimate the level of work with this exercise. So, is it work 75k to finish the work? What Will presented to CES seemed very valuable. I would ask @williamr to share the work with the broader community so a decision can be made. As a community, if we choose to micro-manage work at this level, it will be hard to get anything done in the DAO. ",

However as expressed here above by Rune, a decision has been made. If someone does not appreciate Risk Management, there is little more that I can do from here. To date, there is no clear and explicit guarantees Sept, and still less so Oct, will be paid by Maker. Words I\u2019ve had plenty. With this SR we stopped activity as we can no longer consider Maker as a reliable payer. Therefore I am taking payment risk for my contractors on behalf of Maker. My contractors will be paid, regardless, as they have already produced work for Sept. Should Maker default on payment, which right now is on the table, I\u2019ll need to consider the options available. ",
