Other onboarding resources:   Lore book GitcoinDAO Primer    Hi frens,  I\u2019m writing an overview post about Gitcoin, so that prospective DAO participants know the why/what/how of GitcoinDAO.

So far we\u2019ve funded $58mm of open source software, & are currently moving about $6mm/quarter to OSS de\u2026     ",
