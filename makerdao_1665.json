Let\u2019s discuss it on this call. Related links: End-Game and Endgame Approval MIP Set   27:15   CodeKnight: How do people feel about converting a large portion of our Surplus Buffer to stETH? It is risky because our revenue is already based on ETH prices. If our Surplus Buffer is also in ETH, then if there is a bear market and ETH crashes 50%, we lose half of our Surplus Buffer and all our revenue. Then we have to sell off ETH at a loss to cover expenses. But I am curious if there are any alternate views.   S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I think the proposal was mainly for the income generated by MakerDAO - not the Surplus Buffer. The main difference was to change the capital at risk value\u2026  Payton Rose: Regarding risk considerations, it is a different ball game for Dai backing having a stable asset versus an inherently volatile asset. Do people have any opinions on that? A lot of this has been wrapped in the bigger question of de-pegging.    32:23   CodeKnight: Is there a safe buffer capitalization?  33:59   Payton Rose: I am curious if anyone is doing anything permissionless to investigate and look into this to contribute. Many of our calls end up being on the permission side. We say what governance will allow us to do or what the future will bring to Maker. But one of the exciting things about this organizational structure is that anyone interested can show up and showcase their open source contributions, say here is what I did; should I do more? We need more people thinking not about what governance allows me to do but what I can do for the DAO.  35:13   PaperImperium: If any large MKR holders happen to be on this call, we would love to hear from them.  36:54   Jacob: When we talk about de-pegging, what happens in Oracles and how we value assets in vaults determines the amount of Dai that can be active. If the value of Dai has gone down, does that mean people can now take more of Dai out against their assets? Are we still valuing those assets in USD? I have not quite understood this reading the proposals.   Conclusion  Payton Rose 40:20 Suggestion Box  Credits  Andrea Suarez produced this summary. Kunfu-po produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call.  ",

Yes. However, it is also much more liquid. This is the trade-off that we are alluding to.    35:33   PaperImperium: It does not seem easy to justify the Coinbase USDC.  This is the choice up to the Maker token holders.    35:53   Chat: How long does it take to liquidate a one billion dollar USD position?  If you redeem directly with Gemini, it should not take very long.    38:29   Payton Rose: There is a signal request affecting the parameters for the GUSD PSM vault.  40:11   Kianga Daverington: Can you explain what is in this signal request and how it relates to the Gemini proposal?  The signal request is the kickstart to ask Maker governance whether they would like to start changing the parameters to make it possible to fill the GUSD PSM, which at the moment has a DC of 60 million DAI.    42:42   Patrick_J: If we were to hit a hundred million average required for the incentives, then we would not need an entity approved by Maker governance to receive the interest.  43:33   Tim Black: Can anyone speak to the negative tin?  This change has already been pushed by protocol engineering, but it still needs to go through audits.    46:40   Patrick_J: Does GUSD have a blacklist function like USTC does?

MIP82 is a profit-seeking venture, whereas MIP81 is more strategic.    59:14   Payton Rose: Regarding the collateralization of Bitcoin and against this.

We are structuring it in the custody agreement.    1:00:54   Patrick_J: If the collateral falls, would the liquidation take place off-chain?  In case they are in breach, we take the collateral. We could keep the Bitcoin or the ETH, or we send them to be liquidated and hopefully gain USDC or whatever is the relevant currency and get them back to Maker.    1:03:20   Payton Rose: If this MIP is submitted for the October cycle, voting will wrap up on the 24th. Assuming it is positive, how long would this take to get rolling on your end?  I hoped we could complete this before the end of November.    1:05:45   Raphael: Why would Coinbase do that? How are they making money on that deal?  They borrow this particular collateral, the ETH, and Bitcoins at a certain rate. They put that out to us as collateral. They receive USDC from us. That USDC used to lend to their customers in their margin lending business. Fundamentally there is a place where all these interest rates make sense.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:08:12  We will be back same time and same place next week.

How do we identify it? \u2013 17:07   What can be done to prevent burnout? \u2013 20:33      Speaker: Question (or new topic).   Discussion Segment  Coinbase USDC Proposal  Payton Rose 31:53   Patrick J: GovAlpha disclaimer. GovAlpha presents concerns about the governance process regarding MIP81. Every MIP needs to follow the MIP0 template. The current MIP81 lacks clarity, as well as several other things. We need to determine more information from this proposal if we were to proceed with putting this on-chain.  39:29   Jen: Coinbase has been our partner for many years. And as such, we\u2019re always talking about ways to utilize our partner platforms to increase Dai usage, Dai adoption, and essentially growth for the Protocol. One discussion was born out of this new product that Coinbase is launching, and they brought that to us this first-time opportunity, which led to helping SF to build a framework and monetize USDC in the PSM.  42:03   Chris Mooney: Is there any room in the deal for growth to suggest to Coinbase what I mentioned on the last governance call: rather than us, move custody over to them to deal with the USCC that\u2019s in the PSM blocked a block?  51:56   Chris Mooney: Diversifying out into real-world assets was the idea that they would all be independently risk scoped and jurisdictionally balanced. With the tight peg, I am worried that the only types of real-world assets, quote-unquote, that we can diversify into are US Treasury-style assets. If we find another jurisdiction under the hood, right, that jurisdiction will just be using like Blackrock ETFs or BlackRock, like Treasury vehicles.  53:47  Were you talking about using smart contracts to mitigate the risk of default location or other acts by custodians?  57:51   Chris Blec: who can set up Q&A with Coinbase live-recorded most of our MakerDao calls?   MIP80 MKR Compensation Guidelines 59:21   CodeKnight: I want to create a standardized system, so we are not spending much time and energy arguing over 18 or 20 different sets of Maker compensation guidelines. It\u2019s still in a rough draft. To be clear. I love to have more feedback because I like it when I put out a 75% number that was just kind of a number I made up, and I am not an expert on investing. I saw that we were getting a lot of these proposals, and there was no clear standard, and you get that people start doing it personally like: we are rejecting your Maker compensation because we don\u2019t like your type. I don\u2019t want that to be the case; I want it to be that people who request Maker vesting will know in advance whether they will get it or not because it follows the guidelines or it does not fail.  1:02:14   Robert:: I think the first decision is, is that as a community, do we need to have guidelines, right? So that\u2019s just a question that the community will answer through voting. However, that might work. The second piece of that is that for me, it\u2019s always about what\u2019s market-driven rates for compensation and incentives. Because whether we like it or not, we compete against a much broader audience for talent. And that talent is not only engineers but also program people, project people, communication people, and all sorts of individuals.[\u2026]  1:05:17   CodeKnight: What should our total compensation be for this employee? What percent should be Maker?  1:12:28  Who do we want to help with the Protocol longer term? If people are here for one year, two years, five years, six months, whatever, they\u2019re getting into the weeds, they believe in the project enough to want to commit their full-time work life to that; I think that\u2019s something that the DAO should value.

We would need more cash than the 20 million left over for our existing risks. These risks include existing vaults, bad liquidations, real-world assets, workforce expenses, and Oracle\u2019s. 2.) If we buy a bunch of staked-ETH or other protocol-involved collateral, it\u2019ll approach under collateralization if the prices go down enough. Then, we\u2019d be forced to sell some of those assets to avoid going under 100%.  31:00   Psychonaut: How will we accumulate enough staked-ETH over the next five years to back a substantial portion of Dai?  33:36   David Utrobin: What is GovAlpha\u2019s readiness for this MIP set to go into formal submission?   Payton Rose: Our approach as GovAlpha is to respect the MIP author\u2019s intentions. They have the right to have their vision heard by Maker holders if it doesn\u2019t break any of our MIP rules. Core Unit offboarding should be put up independently. When we think about the Core Unit\u2019s side, we understand the possible frustration of being offboarded when it had nothing to do with your performance. By keeping it individual, we allow for self-advocacy and campaigning for your Core Unit. Only the off-boardings and LDO to MKR spot will be separate. The rest of the MIPs will be bundled together. Circling back to David\u2019s original question of completeness, there have been a few incomplete things with the MIP. Rune will submit his edits before Wednesday.    37:45   Raphael: If the MIPs pass, the pregame products will be developed?   Payton Rose: Yes. Rune said there isn\u2019t much to go first. Maybe ETH or Dai can be developed in terms of the wrapper. Once the MIPs pass, we will deliver on the tech. From a governance perspective, this is the first wave of proposals asking the community about the end game\u2019s direction.  Raphael: Assuming this will pass, should CUs take on additional tasks? I assume this would be extra work on front ends and smart contracts, for instance, deprioritizing collaterals.     Q&A 00:00   Kat: We have translated MakerDAO Docs. We put a forum post up in Spanish; some people could have missed it. We could not integrate it into their site yet; we have it on Notion. That is able for everybody to access.  40:00   Juan: There was something you did go over on the Forum but skipped this time: the metrics for the previous stage of the Program. Presenting metrics and setting milestones could potentially help Delegates to evaluate the proposal.  41:05   David Utrobin: What is the support of the Protocol Engineering Team on this?  Derek: We work at the will of governance. If the MIPs pass, there will be some work, and we will need to scope out what that involves. There are a lot of things that come into play. We will do a typical product management planning around what that work involves. We have not done any of that. We had conversations, but they have all been in the spirit of exploratory. Let us see how the MIPs evolve, what happens, and then take it from there, but once we go through the MIPs, the MIPs will get passed, then we start allocating formal resources to this work. So that will happen if MIPs pass.    44:18   Kianga Daverington: (x?)(Any compliance on the regulatory review required for MetaDAOs to tokenitiences at any time? Are people worried about securities issues with launching a new token?)   Payton Rose: I am not a lawyer. I cannot give a legal answer. Even those of us that are might be hesitant to. However, from the governance end, if there is a specified legal review in the MIP, then that would need to take place for it to go forward. If there is not, we would not require it on the governance end. It does not mean someone could try to pursue some legal advice from one of their entities independently. But we use the MIPs as the bylaws. If the MIPs specify that something needs to happen before it could go forward, that is for us, as governance facilitators, to say: the MKR holders voted for this. They wanted this dependency covered before it reached the next stage, so we will not let it reach that next stage until that dependency is uncovered. So there are jurisdictional questions. Can Maker create smart contracts like the tokens? Does that improve regulatory or legal risk?    48:08   Lazer: To answer Kianga\u2019s comment. We have not identified the risk that some of these tokens could be considered securities. We will conduct an initial analysis SES legal research. We will share the results because we want to share these concerns with Rune. We want to mitigate the risk that we are here issuing securities, or if there are securities, how can this be done in a compliant manner? But we will conduct an initial analysis because we have not identified this risk. These questions are always jurisdictional. We will start analyzing American jurisdiction, how we test it, and so on. It is not the only jurisdiction in the world but is the most predominant. So we will do an initial analysis and share it with the community.  50:44   Raphael: I would be interested in sharing, from the perspective of CUs, how do you prepare for the Endgame plan, or are you waiting? How are these preparations happening? How much of your time does that take?   Derek: I joined these calls. I do not join all of them, but I try to make the majority of them and keep a hold on how the concepts evolve, and they have evolved quite a lot since. We started talking Sagittarius initially, and there has been a lot of evolution since then. It takes a lot of my time, so I try to give summaries back to the team, and we had one-on-ones with Rune earlier this year.  Robert: I have attended every call that Rune has hosted and the ones the delegates of ours did. I appreciate the time people spend trying to bring the information out. The challenge that I have is that everything is conceptual.    1:01:41   Nadia: I wanted to share how it is for me and growth with all the Endgame and the transition. After it is approved or not, it will be easier because that will help us inside CUs to focus on developing the Endgame plan. Because we now have a plan and a vision, we must go to the details and implement them. The same for MetaDAOs, and clusters. And there has not been a DAO effort on that because it has not been approved yet. Whenever this is approved, it will become our priority for CUs. My main concern is that the Endgame plan is coming all this time, and this transition time has been quite difficult because it is hard to plan, know what my team will do for the next months, and set objectives. With uncertainty, it is hard. I suppose that is the same for all CUs because without understanding the direction of the DAO, it is hard to organize ourselves and go for a goal. So we are doing what we suppose will continue, whatever will result from the Endgame plan voting. Teleport is coming, Multichain, and it has to continue as one of the biggest and main strategies for Maker, so we are going in that direction. But then, it will be a different story once the Endgame plan is approved and started because CUs mandates and the budgets will be reduced, and we will have to reorganize everything. It is hard for me to plan anything without a time frame and in the middle of a storm. We have no idea what Maker will look like in three months. That is the hardest part.  1:05:56   Raphael: This is my idea of how to work and have a piece of mind right now. Suppose you think about Maker as something that has a great product and is generating revenue. Then you think about the CUs as an independent business that in the Endgame plan, if you think where in this plan do I see myself, where do I want to go there, how can I improve, make sure that I create an outcome that is profitable for the whole team. Then you are in a good spot because you do not need the permission of Rune or anybody to go and create. That is the plan of the Endgame plan to unlock all this. And Flipside is going through a very similar transition where we are moving away into a future that is much more enabling for individual contributors to go and create. We have challenges. People are struggling with how vague it is, but it is the biggest strength because it is a blank canvas you can use to paint. That is the framing I choose to think about that. I have seen Rune taking input without compromising on his basic tenet, which is how to create a DAO that scales in a purely decentralized fashion. That is a radical departure from how the DAO currently operates.   Nadia: I am not concerned about my CU\u2019s future or the growth contributors within the Endgame plan(\u2026) My concern is how to plan. For example, should we consider the metaDAOs or stick to the mandate? Let us say we have a campaign with finance, but to do that, we have to sign an agreement and commit with them for the next six months. Should we do it or not? In terms of the Endgame Plan, we should not because what Rune is looking for is that Maker Core is as permissionless as possible where agreements with third parties do not exist; everything is permissionless. If you think about that, we should not do it, but if we do not, we are losing a huge opportunity for Maker, which is part of our mandate as a Growth CU. That is the hard part. We struggle every day because we want to help Maker holders do whatever is best for the protocol, but we also have a mandate.     Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:15:48  If you did not have your voice heard in today\u2019s call, the forum threads would hopefully provide a more long-lasting testament to what we are discussing and debating. I would encourage anyone to engage and follow up on these threads later. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you and lead these calls weekly. We will be back same time, the same place next week, and huge thanks again to everyone who helped make this call possible.  Suggestion Box  Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.

Yes, David. We have translated MakerDAO Docs. We put a forum post up in Spanish; some people could have missed it. We could not integrate it into their site yet; we have it on Notion. That is able for everybody to access.  40:00   Juan: There was something you did go over on the Forum but skipped this time: the metrics for the previous stage of the Program. Presenting metrics and setting milestones could potentially help Delegates to evaluate the proposal.  41:20   David: Was not there already Spanish translations and something akin to the Ambassador Program initially piloted by CommDev, which then withered down until you, essentially, picked it up?   Discussion  Endgame MIP Set  David Utrobin 43:09   The end game MIP set has a few top-level MIPS: 83, 84, and 85. 83 recognizes the initial meta DAO clusters. 84 is a way for the Maker protocol to borrow against this treasury. MIP 85 is Lito MKR, part of the lotto MKR deal Rune built into the end game. The point of it is to make governing major functions simpler. For example, we have six engineering teams. I imagine a cluster would be a meta DAO of all the engineering teams in one place. Rune is trying to simplify the governance related to groups of core units.  47:01   Joshua: It looks like the mandate modification sub-proposals give core units decision-making powers that used to be controlled by Maker holders. Are facilitators now responsible for certain things that used to be decisions that Maker holders would make?  49:44   Raphael: These MIPs are like skeleton MIPs. How does this process work? Are these placeholders that can be amended in any form during the RFC periods? What can I expect from the process? Would could happen until these come to vote?  57:28   David Utrobin: Does anybody know what proposals Rune hasn\u2019t posted yet, but intends to post as part of this MIPs set?   Discussion  Coinbase USDC Proposal 1:00:30   David Utrobin: Coinbase posted a proposal on the forum this week to take 1.6 billion USDC from the PSM and custody it for us in exchange for some yield. The primary conversation I\u2019ve seen in the forum surroundings proposal has been around risk. Gives people on the call time to list the pros and cons of the proposal.    1:07:00   David Utrobin: I heard it\u2019s the same risk as USDC in the PSM. They could present in the PSM, so it\u2019s the same risk if they have custody of USDC. They can screw us one way or another. It\u2019s just two different ways of screwing us. Where is that statement wrong?  1:08:25   Chris: Can Maker currently move USDC without permission? Would Maker have to ask Coinbase for permission and notify them before moving USDC? What timescale does that happen on?  1:09:45   PaperImperium: I don\u2019t quite understand why they need to hold it and have custody of it if they\u2019re not going to lend it out re-hypothecated. How will they get the yield?  1:12:32   Chris: I asked in the thread where the rewards are coming from. They replied: \u201cThe USDC Coinbase uses to pay institutional rewards comes from its inventory of USDC. Coinbase funds the inventory from its purchases of USDC from Circle, purchases of USDC from users of Coinbase, and payments that Coinbase receives pursuant to its revenue-sharing grant\u201d. They made it sound like they\u2019re just paying the interest out of their corporate treasury as if they\u2019re deriving some benefit from the custody of the Maker PSM USDC. What benefit is Coinbase deriving that makes them want to pay this reward in exchange for custody? I don\u2019t know if anybody can answer that, because I haven\u2019t gotten an answer from them yet. There must be some benefit to Coinbase.  1:13:51   David Utrobin: Is Coinbase planning to use this USDC?   Conclusion  Payton Rose 1:28:57 Suggestion Box  Credits  Constanza produced this summary. Larry Wu produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call.  ",
