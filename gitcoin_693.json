            "body": "This is a test to get some feedback for our budget proposal. Rather than simply request a budget with a slight reduction, we wanted to get feedback from the community on each outcome FDD plans to work on during Season 14. \n\nTHIS VOTE WILL BE USED TO HELP US CONSTRUCT A FINAL BUDGET REQUEST FOR SEASON 14. \n\nFDD has Outcomes which are nested under the following 3 priorities. \n\nSybil Defense (SD) - Protect the legitimacy of funding round outcomes\n\nGrants Intelligence Agency - Provide credible neutrality to grant eligibility moderation\n\nEvolution - Operate the workstream and improve our processes, knowledge and insights.\n\nHere is how the outcomes fit into a 2x3 grid showing operational vs innovation along with the future potential for each outcome. \n\n![FDD Budget \u2022 Gitcoin Holdings - Google Chrome 2022-05-12 at 2.06.01 PM.jpeg](ipfs://QmUCTjKfF1PRqrbuZVFdyjZshiP1S768QGCqPsnL4d6sAJ)\n\nHere is our current plan for how budget will be spread amongst the outcomes. (Notice that storytellers, investigations, and catalyst have been removed)\n\n\n![FDD Season 14 Budget - Google Sheets - Google Chrome 2022-05-13 at 9.14.14 AM (1).jpeg](ipfs://QmbhC4E2iuJejDvPZ14xuAWDoJ3BfypVXtmp4q3F1PfBYQ)\n\nNow we want you to vote to indicate which of these outcomes you think FDD should be working towards. A lot of feedback we received was because of fundamental differences in the direction we should be taking. \n\nHere is every outcome, it's deliverables, and how not funding it would look. \n\n",
