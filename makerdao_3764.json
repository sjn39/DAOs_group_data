While we probably all would like to keep the amount of USDC in the PSM lower than it is today, the PSM is still the best weapon we have to keep the peg. I want to propose that we do a Mario Draghi move to  send out a message that the peg is our highest goal and have a tool ready to adapt to crazy market moves   Activate DC-IAM for PSM-USDC-A I want to signal for changing PSM-USDC-A to  activate DC-IAM  set a really high line on it with corresponding gap and ttl defined by @Risk-Core-Unit    Pros:  hopefully enough headroom to not need another urgency exec on the PSM strong tool to keep the peg   Cons:  might result in a even higher dependency on USDC  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     no change set line to 10 B (+8 B) set line to 15 B (+12 B) set line to 20 B (+17 B) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-06-17T13:00:00Z; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

As much as we can say it\u2019ll be fixed in the future with RWA DAI, right now, DAI is heavily reliant on USDC. This proposal only makes those arguments more true than before. I don\u2019t have a solution but the criticism coming at us is completely fair and warranted until we show a demonstrable ability to scale up DAI supply faster than the demand for leverage.     PaperImperium:  It\u2019s the deal of a lifetime.   It is until something goes wrong with USDC. The space is way too young to put that much faith into a single centralized entity. I think there\u2019s merit to your point but it\u2019s not quite a no-brainer. As for the PSM debt ceiling, I would make the following points:   Is there an issue right now where the market believes that we will let DAI go off peg? I don\u2019t think this is the case. Our commitment to the peg doesn\u2019t need to be proven with a huge move like this. Even when the PSM DC is hit, the peg still stays where it is because arbitrageurs know that we eventually will raise the DC with an exec.   Urgent execs are annoying but they aren\u2019t that much a thorn in our side.   I don\u2019t see the necessity to do this right now. The peg is fine and having the occasional urgent exec gives us much better control over how quickly the PSM grows. ",

Hopefully, we\u2019re not doing that every two weeks (we\u2019ve only had one urgent exec for the PSM DC if I recall correctly, the remaining increases were normal execs) so the real question for me is whether this is such an undue strain on governance. I would agree with this proposal if there were peg problems but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all.  There are two kinds of arbitrageurs: those who believe we will raise the DC and those who only play the game when they have a cast iron guarantee. The peg is unaffected as long as there are enough arbitrageurs of the first kind. The con of such a high PSM debt ceiling is that any type of event where the credibility of USDC comes into question (whether real or even fake news) and its price dips below $1, our PSM is going to instantly be full of an asset we overpaid for. DAI is supposed to be pegged to $1 and USDC is just a proxy. If that proxy no longer represents $1, we should minimize the damage. Some point out that if USDC has issues, we\u2019re screwed anyway - this is true to some extent but doesn\u2019t justify allowing ourselves to be screwed over three times as badly. Lastly, given that we are considering several other stablecoin PSMs precisely to avoid being overly dependent on USDC, raising the USDC PSM debt ceiling by at least a factor of 3 seems to go against that effort.

The best solution is to simply take some of this USDC \u2013 we have $2 billion and counting of it \u2013 and swap it into USD and then income-producing assets. That lowers our counterparty risk to Circle, lowers the perception of us as a wrapper, lowers the opportunity cost of having $2 billion on the balance sheet that is sitting idle, and overall makes the protocol safer by having the anticipated income to draw from. The question is how do we get from Point A (where we are now) to Point B (take some of this USDC float to earn income and diversify our risk). It\u2019s understandable for us to be at Point A today, but really unforgivable from both a risk management and profit maximizing perspective if we\u2019re still sitting on Point A by the back half of the year. So let\u2019s all start getting comfortable with the idea of taking some of our USDC and putting it to work. In the meantime, hopefully our Centrifuge and 6S experience will help us figure out the best way to structure that kind of relationship. As long as we will move closer to Point B and further from Point A in the future, all this USDC is a free float. If this inflow continues (and maybe it won\u2019t), we can probably earn more from reinvesting a portion of the USDC than from our current core business. ",
