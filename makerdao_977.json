                    "content": " Overview With the recently introduced Rate Limited Flapper we successfully avoided any further 0-bids on flap auctions. In a nutshell, the Rate Limited Flapper only allows to kick off a new auction if the new auction will not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid. However, the value for the lid was set to 150k DAI based on a proposal by the Risk CU so we can run 5 flap auctions in parallel, leading to a maximum of 7.2 MM DAI auctioned per day. I already stated in the original proposal post by Risk that I\u2019d rather see a lower lid, as i don\u2019t see any reason why we would need to burn that much MKR. With this Signal Request I would like to propose we set the lid to the same value as bump - 30000 DAI - so we make sure that at any time there is a maximum of 1 flap auction running. Please note that there is no urgency on this topic as we have the Surplus Buffer set to a level of 250 MM DAI which will mean we will most likely not see any flap auctions anytime soon anyway. But I am pretty sure we will forget about this setting once we are there again, so i\u2019d like to fix it right now.  Shall we set the lid to 30k DAI? As the current bump is set to 30000 DAI, the minimum lid we can have is 30000 DAI as well, effectively limiting the amount of parallel flap auctions to 1.  Pros  in times of huge spikes on the System Surplus spilling over the Surplus Buffer, the resulting auctions will be spread over 5x the time compared to the current setting - a more steady burn   Cons  we will limit the maximum of MKR burnt a day from 7.2MM DAI to 1.44MM DAI     Shall we set the lid to 30k DAI?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This poll will run until 2022-05-12T22:00:00Z and will be taken to a following onchain poll if the Yes-option wins against the No-option. ",
