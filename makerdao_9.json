Links reflect my view of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories right now. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or a pm.  Three-Point Summary \u2018What\u2019s the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  There are currently six recognized delegates and five shadow delegates, creating a total of 10,451.35 MKR delegated. The Risk Core Unit announces their decision to skip the Signal Poll for decreasing liquidation ratios for various vault types; these changes are in this week\u2019s poll. The Growth Core Unit and Bitpay ask the community what they would like to spend their Dai on.    ICYMI - Announcements @prose11 announces that Governance will be skipping the weekly executive for various reasons provided in the post. In addition, he asks the community for feedback concerning the communication of executive cancelations provided by the GovAlpha Core Unit. The executive for August 20th will contain a bundle of content from both weeks. @MakerMan announces his Delegate Platform with intentions to help grow MakerDAO into a $1 trillion entity by pushing security, reliability, and transparency of the protocol through both a micro and macro outlook. @christiancdpetersen from the Real World Finance Core Unit published an assessment of potential structures for the Maker protocol\u2019s adoption of real world assets. It contemplates both the creation of a legal entity engaged with the Maker protocol (the \u201cGovernance Avatar\u201d) and a legal entity to be engaged with the real world asset (the \u201cRWA Entity\u201d). @monkey.irish publishes the Collateral Engineering Services Product Plan for onboarding collaterals, which includes their Product focus, Product and collateral priorities, planning concepts, and Product planning. @maxglass from RWA Co. introduces the company goals and agreements. He also provides a short description of himself. The RWA Co. concept was initially introduced by @g_dip in this post. @alec from the Content Production Core Unit published Dai on Different Networks #6, which provides the community an overview of DAI circulating on non-ETH blockchains, layer-2 Rollups, and various bridges. @Vojtch from ETHbrno is asking the community for some funding to help with expenses for their Ethereum focused Con in Brno, Czech republic. Their goal is to address new users and provide education through informational talks and networking. @Aes was the first to let us know when DAI outstanding blew through the 6 billion mark. Thanks!   Active Discussions  \u2018What\u2019s going on? You think what?! You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 [[Executive Vote Request] - Raising 6s\u2019 RWA001-A debt ceiling] - @mrabino1 speaks to the community stating that 6S has fulfilled all of its requirements and is requesting to raise its debt ceiling to the proposed 15MM along with an initial stability fee of 3.00% in the earliest possible executive vote. Centrifuge: An Update on RWA in DeFi - @spin seeks community feedback and comments on his update for progress by Centrifuge and their priorities going forward. Decreasing Liquidation Ratios - Proposal - @Primoz from the Risk Core Unit presents the first adjustment proposal along with some analysis backing up the recommendation. This proposal comes on the heels of growing USDC dominance in the collateral portfolio as one approach to increase non-USDC Dai supply. Continued Discussions: \u2018Who said discussions should end after a week!?\u2019 Institutional and Long Term Vaults Proposal - @Derek and the Protocol Engineering Core Unit have put forward a proposal to create Institutional Vaults and Long-Term Vaults through a new mechanism. Fixed Rate Vaults Proposal With Deco Protocol - @vamsi from Deco Protocol proposes a new product to bring new revenue-generating and user retention feature to MakerDAO Fixed Rate Vaults through the integration of the Deco Protocol. Fixed-Rate Vaults via Deco Protocol offer a solution to volatility in fixed rates and stability fees.   Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019   [Signal Request] Lower the Flash Mint Fee to 0% - @hexonaut suggests following dYdX and permanently removing Flash Mint Fees helping improve both arbitrage for DAI and front-end UX. Although there is a risk for potential loss of revenue, dYdX has shown its liquidity pool increase from 138k to ~10M, which is large enough to cover most use cases. The post follows up his Initial Flash Mint Module Fee Signal Request.     Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community.

                    "content": " Forum at a Glance!  August 6th - August 12th The one-stop-shop for finding out what\u2019s being discussed by governance right now. Links reflect my view of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories right now. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or a pm.  Three-Point Summary \u2018What do I need to know as an MKR Holder this week?\u2019  There are currently 10 delegates with a total of 10,102 MKR delegated. Total DAI supply keeps hitting new highs, now at nearly 5,87B. There is currently over 12B DAI locked in collateralization!    ICYMI - Announcements The July Financial Report has been submitted by the Real World Finance Core Unit Team. It has been another challenging month due to a month-over-month decreased demand in lending and income. On a year-over-year basis, all key metrics have improved significantly. The Risk Core Unit Team published an analysis on whether we should lower liquidation ratios for Maker vaults in order to boost DAI supply and thereby Maker Vault attractiveness. The Risk Team used their Maker Collateral Risk Model to quantify how a lower liquidation ratio of a particular Vault type affects the \u201crisk premium to debt exposure curve.\u201d The Risk Core Unit Team published simulations on Gas and Vault Cost from a User Perspective discussing gas, various parameters, and platforms that can help determine which Vault sizes are unfavorable for MakerDAO. The Risk Core Unit Team published the Risk Evaluation for G-UNI-DAI-USDC. Since LP shares are created as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and do not automatically reinvest fee earnings, G-UNI-DAI-USDC is a fungible strategy token representing deposits into Uniswap v3. The Risk Core Unit Team is at it again by publishing an analysis on identifying the market activity of Vault users, which is based on a snapshot taken on August 3rd representing the majority of issued Dai from non-stablecoin Vaults and PSM with a focus on Dai rate arbitrage on popular DeFi lending markets on Ethereum. The Real World Finance Core Unit published the Real World Assets Report for July, which still contains just one pool: New Silver, at 6MM exposure. Messari published a report on MakerDAO Valuation. It leverages charts provided by the Real World Finance Core Unit to succinctly cover both MKR and DAI traction, tokenomics, valuation, and risk. They also cover recent protocol upgrades as well as our roadmap and competition. @James submits a collateral onboarding application for RAI, which is a non pegged, ETH backed stable asset built by Reflexer. RAI\u2019s objective is to serve as alternative collateral to centralized stablecoins such as USDC. @pyramidmaker submits an RFC proposal for the StarkNet Engineering Core Unit (SECU), which puts forward a plan for enabling Dai minting and potentially leveraging on StarkNet to keep the Maker protocol attractive to users in the ZK-rollup, Layer 2 domain. @bainpm submits an RFC proposal for the Development & UX Core Unit (DUX-001), which seeks to improve the user experience for all governance participants through facilitating optimal decision-making processes and ensuring security for the Maker protocol.   Active Discussions  \u2018What\u2019s going on? You think what?! You\u2019re 100% wrong, and here\u2019s why\u2026\u2019 Offboarding Unprofitable Collaterals - The Risk Core Unit Team details the difficulties with maintaining Vault types that have low usage and proposes a roadmap discussing to offboard such assets that lack a realistic prospect of becoming profitable in the future. Fixed Rate Vaults Proposal With Deco Protocol - @vamsi from Deco Protocol proposes a new product to bring new revenue-generating and user retention feature to MakerDAO Fixed Rate Vaults through the integration of the Deco Protocol. Fixed-Rate Vaults via Deco Protocol offer a solution to volatility in fixed rates and stability fees. RWF - Financial Planning & Analysis Roadmap - @Aes will be joining the @Real World Finance Core Unit Team on a full-time basis beginning September and is reaching out to the community for feedback discussing certain priorities and the short-term roadmap of the RWF FP&A team. [Informal Poll] Increasing the Surplus Buffer - With MakerDAO expenses at ~32MM, we are not going to fill the Surplus Buffer anytime soon. @ultraschuppi asks the community to discuss the idea of increasing the Surplus Buffer again, promoting that accrued income is going into the Buffer instead of (potentially) causing some MKR to burn. [Informal Poll] Using the Cayman Foundation to invest in financials assets at scale - @sebVentures asks the community whether we should prioritize the investments in \u201csafe\u201d securities through the Cayman RWA Foundation as a way to reduce the USDC exposure in the medium-term. POC for Maker Delegation Stats - @urbanisierung from MakerLabs shares their recently introduced webapp, which is currently a single-page proof of concept application that increases transparency around Maker Delegates. It offers two main views: an overview of all delegates and a detailed view of the corresponding polls and executives. Create a PAX PSM - @carlkvogel from Paxos proposed to create a PAX PSM to extend PAX as a way to diversify DAI collateral. This comes on the heels of community concern around the growth of DAI\u2019s USDC backing, which sits at 60.6% according to Daistats.com. To sweeten the deal, Paxos plans to add DAI to its platform before Q1 of 2022.   Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Recognised Delegate Requirements - @LongForWisdom writes a detailed overview of the current requirements and application system to become a delegate in the Maker community. Check out this thread for more posts related to delegation.  Collateral Calls - Calling all Projects! - @juan sets up a signup thread for projects wishing to present on the bi-weekly collateral call. Know any potential collateral partners that want to present? Refer them here. Collateral Status Index - Confused about the current status of the various collateral types that have been discussed recently? Check out this post to find out the status and current position of each within the onboarding process. Weekly MIPs Updates - @blimpa bring the latest updates in the world of MIPs. The Official Welcome Thread - A welcome and introductions thread. Not strictly governance, but if anyone new or old wants to introduce themselves, now is your chance!   Help Wanted  \u2018Oh %#$?, we need a doodad, and we need it now.\u2019 Wanted: Governance Contributors for GovAlpha - @LongForWisdom puts out the call for new team members! Different tracks are available depending on interest and time commitment. Wanted: Risk Domain Monitoring Tools - @Primoz puts out a call for additional support to produce monitoring tools for the risk team. Grants are available. We could always use help reviewing MIPs in the Request for Comment phase. ",
