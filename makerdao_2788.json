Created by members of the Community Development team to help personalize interactions between community members in the Maker Forum, the first release includes 33 badges that can be earned for taking actions relating to Dai and Governance. IF there are badges you know should be released that you are not receiving, please post about it in our Github, here. Badges in Discourse, the software used to power the Maker Forum, are normally used for likes on posts and receiving feedback on your posts but our new Badges enable community members to demonstrate their participation in various aspects of MakerDAO. Read on to learn more about what badges are available, how they were created, and where you can go to redeem them.  1200\u00d7670 375 KB    MakerDAO Community Badges    Governance  |177.43746910528915x232650\u00d7850 569 KB   Governance Polls On-chain polling is used to understand the sentiment of token holders toward implementing and changing risk parameters.

This badge is tiered, the next levels are earning in DSR for 3 months and for 6 months.  |199x259.11194927421841137\u00d71487 385 KB   Bid on a Collateral Auction Once unsafe vaults are bitten, the collateral is swapped for Dai to pay back the outstanding debt. Bid on a collateral auction from a liquidated vault to unlock this achievement. This badge is tiered; bid on another 5, 10, or 25 auctions to unlock further achievements!   Making The Badges  The Badges are created using a modified version of ERC721 based on a special form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) called Unique Non-Transferrable NFTs (NTNFTs). Like NFTs, NTNFTs can\u2019t be divided into parts the way \u201cregular\u201d cryptocurrencies can. Unlike NFTs, however, NTNFTs can\u2019t be transferred from one address to another after they\u2019ve been distributed.  BadgesFlowChart1502\u00d7735 82.7 KB  The goal of this project is to increase community engagement by gamifying interactions between the people of MakerDAO. Badges aren\u2019t just a fun way to tell how different community members participate in MakerDAO, they provide a basis for different forms of coordination around things like leaderboards, vote delegation, and communication in the Maker Forums. To learn more about this project and how the badges are created, please visit the Readme on Github.   How to Redeem Your Badges  These badges are now available for redemption via the Maker Forum. Redeeming badges does tie the address(es) used to participate in MakerDAO and use Dai to the username you use in the Maker Forum. The risk is that a researcher can deduce the likelihood of an address and username being connected based on the badges claimed. Here\u2019s how to claim your badge(s):  1317\u00d7425 45.2 KB    Click on your avatar at the top-right corner of the page.   Click your username in the top-left corner of the pop-up menu.   Select \u201cPreferences.\u201d   At the bottom of the \u201cPreferences\u201d page is a button that says \u201cImport Maker Badges.\u201d    Click \u201cImport Maker Badges.\u201d   Connect to MetaMask and sign the transaction.   Signing the transaction unlocks your badges, the signing address qualifies. You do have to use the same wallet that is connected to the Governance Portal. You may need to refresh the page. Signing the contract twice won\u2019t cause an issue but won\u2019t change the status either. You should receive a notification with a link confirming you\u2019ve received your Badge(s). Please note that it may take several minutes for the system to process your claim. That\u2019s it!   Finding the Badges   Click the 3-bar menu icon next to your picture/name in the top right corner. This opens a small menu that includes a \u201cBadges\u201d button.   1244\u00d7394 23 KB  Select \u201cBadges\u201d to see all of the badges that are available as well as ones you\u2019ve already obtained. Clicking a specific badge on this page will display all of the users who have obtained the badge.  |624x298.533442938487441348\u00d7646 87.6 KB   Share Your Feedback Have comments, questions, or other feedback you\u2019d like to share?

Redeeming badges through the discourse interface does not incur a gas cost. There are corresponding NFT\u2019s being developed through CDIPs 18 & 29 and gas fee mitigation techniques are being explored to reduce costs before deployment to production. Wallet and Web UI skills should be sufficient for all redemption operations. ",
