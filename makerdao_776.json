We are here again with the latest news about what\u2019s been going on with our favorite algorithm these last few weeks! If you want to check our instance you can find it here. Haven\u2019t you signed up yet? For details on opting in, see Opting in to Sourcecred/Wth is SourceCred?. If there is anything else you would like to see added please leave your comments below.   Announcements Changes in the off-chain incentive system are on! The changes involve the implementation of new initiatives as well as some specific modifications to the SourceCred main instance. We will do user activations every Wednesday from now on. In this way, we believe the opt-in process will be more organized. Payouts will be out next Friday! We will distribute 10,000 DAI based on 25,218 Cred generated last month. Delegate SourceCred payouts also going to be issued next Friday! We will be distribuiting 4,000 DAI based on 6,586 Cred generated. Delegates can track their activity here. Navigate to the DAI Accounts tab  of the Maker instance to see your current DAI balance and total DAI earned.  Newcomers Please welcome @John_Yarwood, @ClausClowes, @Herbalremidy, @Rahii, @Ippy, @JWizard, @One_Pastrami, @TRUEMAKER, and @Joselyn. They are our newest members of the program so If you see them out there, say hi!  Cred Stats In these last two weeks, a total of 14,055 Cred have been generated, with 122 topics and 1398 posts created. We have had two tremendously busy weeks with a lot of activity! As can be seen in both charts, the level of activity and Cred generation has reached the peak of the year, averaging 7,000 Cred per week! Lots of things to discuss, important announcements, and lots of interesting ideas have contributed to this engagement level. It is even clearly seen in the second chart how this period clearly reverses the trend that seemed to be consolidating, with less activity this year compared to the previous one.  767\u00d7496 22.7 KB   756\u00d7516 12.4 KB  Top 5 Categories Below are the top 5 categories of the period, ranked by Cred generated.

Soon we\u2019ll have news about some SourceCred modifications, as well as other interesting changes aimed at improving governance engagement.  Cred Stats In the first two weeks of May, a total of 8,511 Cred was generated, with 102 topics and 953 posts created. As we can see in the first graph below, the production has been quite uneven, with significant levels of activity during the first week and a notable drop in the second. The second graph shows how the same situation occurred in the same period of last year. This may be due to multiple factors, one of which could be the structuring of the governance cycle itself influencing community activity. It will be interesting to see the progression in the coming months to see how it continues and to see whether or not we have a trend in this direction.  759\u00d7491 22.7 KB   744\u00d7521 10.7 KB  Top 5 Categories Below are the top 5 categories of the period, ranked by Cred generated.
