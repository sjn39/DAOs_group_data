The initial 60-day period served the purpose of UNI distribution in a decentralized way to those who did not get an airdrop. It also increased the reward pools liquidity, which is great, but did it serve a material benefit other than distribution? What is the main goal that such a decision is trying to achieve? Subsidizing liquidity? Widening UNI distribution? Or increasing yield until it is higher than the competition? I see the benefit of increased liquidity, but how much did the protocol benefit from that liquidity? I do not know. To assume it is worth $60M+ seems wasteful to me. ",

For me it seems more important to focus on trading volume (which is still much higher on uniswap compared to sushi) and not so much on the TVL, cause if there is high TVL and low trading it\u2019s of no benefit to the lp and they will leave as soon as an incentive runs out.
