Growth Experiments Project description: OptiChads is a 10k original art collection on Optimism. Leveraging the power of \u2018Chad\u2019 to build a strong NFT community around health and wellness culture. With over 10,000 sales and almost 100E in volume we are one of the more successful NFT projects on Optimism.

Yes. We are cc0. Optimism native?: Yes. Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: OptiChads- August 2, 2022 OptiBabes (Next Collection) - Q1 2023 Ecosystem Value Proposition: Recent data from Glassnode indicates that NFTs account for roughly 22% of the gas usage on Ethereum mainnet. Opensea for the Ethereum mainnet has about 2,500,000 total users versus Quix on Optimism that has about 314,000 total users. This data shows both the relevance of NFTs in a thriving ecosystem, and the gap between users that have interacted with NFTs on Ethereum mainnet versus Optimism. This presents a huge opportunity for Optimism to acquire these users. For this to happen there must be strong NFT communities on Optimism with original art like OptiChads. OptiChads minted out in the middle of the bear market and have seen tremendous growth in a period where many other OP NFT projects failed, including the NFT marketplace, Quix. Social dynamics have a lot of impact on NFT sales. We consider the Fitness Challenges to be one of the main catalysts for our growth, as participants spread awareness on Twitter for all to see. The virality of working out to earn $OP has increased our relevancy in the NFT scene. Repeating this experiment with stronger incentives on a broader timeframe will allow more people to participate and ultimately results in continued gains for both the Optimism NFT ecosystem and Optichads. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? Yes. Previous Grant Proposal:     [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] OptiChads NFT Project Governance Fund: Phase 1       Project name: OptiChads  Author name: Dicaso on behalf of OptiChads  L2 recipient address: 0x10850762bac0dc6660630c1effe188a7cbfddc88  Grant category: NFTs & Gaming  Number of OP tokens requested: 50,000  Is/will this project be open sourced? Yes. We are CC0.  I understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes  Is this proposal applicable to a specific committee?  Yes  Project description: A 10K PFP project encouraging\u2026      Holders973\u00d7319 39.3 KB  Our last grant was received on October 28th 2022. In the following 10 weeks we distributed 50,000 OP using our partners at Quest3.xyz to distribute the funds. We also gave out more than 50 NFTs through various Twitter giveaways as this was easier and more practical than doing so all at once. The first week was slow but this quickly changed. On average we gave out 5,000 OP a week. It was rare for the Quests to last longer than a day before all of the slots were filled. We gained more than 1,000 holders while the challenges were active and many are now active community members on both Twitter and Discord. To prevent sybil we eventually moved to Twitter only submissions, on top of additional filters like manual verification, and a requirement to follow our social media. The fitness challenges worked well as a cost effective way to promote Optimism NFTs as a form of viral marketing. Number of OP tokens requested: 200,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives? 50 NFTs through weekly twitter giveaways. Proposal for token distribution: 100% of the tokens will go towards a 12-week fitness campaign. We plan on distributing the the 200,0000 OP equally into 12 weeks as incentives to complete fitness challenges. Every week will have a pool of 16,666 OP. Each week holders of our NFTs will be able to claim a small fraction of OP provided they completed that weeks excercise. For our first week we will aim for 13.89 OP for 1,200 people (16,666 total). We can than dynamically adjust each week by decreasing the rewards and increasing the slots to account for demand. On top of this we will perform robust sybil filtering including on and off chain verificatation, such as following on different socials and holding an NFT. Finally I will personally verify each submission for authenticity. Using the Quest3 platform we can reward our NFT holders OP provided they complete fitness related challenges. Given the success of our previous campaign, we see it as a net gain for the Optimism ecosystem that we repeat the experiment but at a larger scale. A greater allocation of OP allows us to have more participants and avoid people being left out as was the case before. A lot of the collectors on Optimism are priced out of L1. These users are from regions of the world where these rewards have been life changing. This market segment is priced out of L1 NFTs and is a great opportunity for growth. Because rewards are per person, we expect our greatest KPI will be increasing our unique holders count. Our target will be to add another 1,000 holders. This means more participants in the quests as well as more people holding Optimism NFTs. Unique holder count is an important metric that many collectors consider when purchasing NFTs. Giving out 50 NFTs from our treasury as co-incentives will also increase this metric. More holders means more trades so we can also expect an increase in volume which. Volume increasing is a sign of a healthy NFT ecosystem so increasing our current volume to above 300E will also be another KPI that we will track. As our team continues to build products such as a new NFT exchange, and a female collection, we expect there to be interest in OptiChads long after the rewards dry up. We see the promotion of art, and health & wellness as public goods. NFTs allow us to coordinate around these ideas and perpetuate them.

Today OptiChads is the 4th largest NFT project on Optimism at almost half a million dollars in marketcap. We expect this growth to continue. 100% of the funds will go to our community while also serving to promote health and wellness in Web3. This is in line with the ethos of Public Goods of the Optimism Collective. We\u2019re also one of the only NFT projects on Optimism to be verified on Opensea. Claiming a small amount of OP for excercising was a unique usecase that is only made possible by the gas savings of Optimism. This has helped many people from lower income regions while promoting fitness and OP NFTs at the same time. I\u2019m not sorry and If anything we didn\u2019t ask for enough. ",

One thing I was wondering is why are all the tokens being distributed through quest3 instead of some other type of method for a growth experiments grant ? It\u2019s hardly experimental if this is just a scaled up version of the last grant that was received. I see 1000 new holders for your project were formed during the last incentive rewards program but that doesn\u2019t necessarily contribute towards the overall growth of the optimism network with bringing new users onboard from outside the ecosystem which is what these grants are specifically intended for. Also these numbers seem really low for 50,000 tokens that were distributed via rewards. If the goal is to distribute tokens in a way that it creates a larger impact than the profit that was made there would be no relation to the holders of the project. I would much rather see a major focus on how many users joined the network due to the tokens being distributed instead of the individual project itself. This only seems to be beneficial for the previous holders of the project who take profits from new members who are required to purchase an NFT on secondary market in order to receive a token reward.

We use Quest 3 because they support Optimism and have an interface that can be used to easily review submissions as well as community features. Because I am working on a new collection and our dev is working on a new exchange it makes sense to outsource where we can and in this instance they are quite reputable, although If there are alternatives we would be open to explore them. Gaining 1,000 holders in 10 weeks is actually quite a feat given we are a 10k collection. The main purpose of the Quests is to promote our art and create community engagement. When people post their excercises on twitter it directly benefits Optimism as a form of social signalling.  What we propose is no different from a DeFi protocol giving out OP to its LPs. But for NFTs liquidiy is built on a social consensus and the NFT itself is \u201cstake\u201d in the community. It is essential that we support NFT projects on Optimism. The largest NFT exchange Quix is shutting down and the Optimism Quests have ended. Many NFT projects have flatlined because of this yet despite this OptiChads has survived and has grown as an original art project exclusive to Optimism. Investing in the NFT community is a very efffective allocation of capital for Optimism. Liquidity in the NFT ecosystem will benefit other projects as many of our holders are active traders. Other chains such as Solana and Polygon have seen tremendous growth in NFTs. The same is possible for Optimism but only if we invest in our NFT ecosystem and communities. Our proposal was created so that we could do our part in making that happen. I can\u2019t help but feel that if we were a DeFi protocol offering a generic liquidity mining incentive no one would bat an eye, but because we are an NFT project there is extra scrutiny. It absolutely benefits Optimism for there to be an active NFT community. Sucessfull projects bring in collectors, investment, and capital, all of which are needed for the NFT market to grow. Optimism needs to have blue-chip projects so that secondary producs such as aggregators, marketplaces, games, and lending protocols can be built around NFTs as they have on other chains. On your last point the rewards don\u2019t benefit only previous holders. It\u2019s per person so there is no way that having 10 more NFTs would get you more reward than someone who holds 1. I have spent hours a week personally filtering all submissions to prevent gaming the system. The campaign is designed to allow anyone to be a holder for free. Usually after the 3rd week the OP earned would exceed the value of the NFT. I hope people can see the value of this proposal. ",

One key thing that I see missing from your grant unless I completely missed it is that you also made donations to RPGF correct??? That would be crucial metric to include that would affect the way that you\u2019re project operates with the tokenomics of the rewards outweighing the profit! I commend you for doing so. I am also looking at every single Defi protocol that has submitted a proposal for building or growth with as much scrutiny as any others so please do not feel like there\u2019s any special treatment here because you are submitting an NFT project. I am a bit more familiarized with the process to help structure the grants for this category of applicants and may comment more on projects related to NFTs or gaming in an effort to create a rigorous and healthy conversation here for the governance council. I was definitely curious whether you had explored any other options for a token rewards program and I do see that Galxe protocol has a coming soon option for this. Also being a nice partner for brand awareness with a similar format to quest3. I appreciate your efforts and have watched your community grow steadily. I\u2019m sure that you will be able to figure out a way to impact the ecosystem more than the profit of the project itself. ",

I highlighted this in our first proposal right now there is very little coming in from royalties which is my only source of income.  In reality I would have been more profitable at McDonalds than NFTs but I am confident this will change someday. I think fine art and the promotion of health and wellness is itself a public good  which is why I created OptiChads. For our next collection I plan to donate 50% of the mint to the Malala fund which helps girls get educated in countries where it is difficult I think this can also bring awareness to Optimism NFTs. We\u2019ve donated in the past multiple times and we will in the future although I\u2019d like to bring awareness to a new charitble cause with every subsequent mint. On another note profit is super important. It attracts traders, and fuels exchanges. Without profit the system fails, people leave, and entities such as Quix close their doors. An NFT ecosystem is only sucessfull if creators, traders, and exchanges all make money. Our mint was super cheap at .0015E because I realized our success would be contingent on traders turning a profit. This came at my expense, but it was for the good of the ecosystem, and than I donated 50% of the mint on top of this. In a bear market we have to work 10x as hard for 10x less reward. For anyone who questions our resolve I would invite them to look at the OptiChads traits and consider how long it would take for a single man to craft something like that in his moms basement. ",

Your bright smiles and huge muscles are a testament to the Proof of Workout\u00ae (@MSilb7) consensus mechanism Optimism has created with our help. Much love to those of you reaching out to the L1 fanboys and getting your monstrous set of friends and family involved and showing them what web3 is all about, and for enabling us to bridge the gap between health and tech. In the last 5 weeks of challenges last time, you guys were so eager to show off your glorious bodies that we would often run out of OP to give out each week in just a few hours. Often times, I would go to bed and wake up and that week\u2019s quest would be over. We always wanted to target the timezones where most of our holders lived, but there just was not enough OP to distribute and many were left out - like the 10 pound barbells at the end of the rack. We changed the time we would release the next quest a few times, but the result was always the same. Too many Chads were left behind. Our community grew like our biceps and the newest of Chads were left out the most. That\u2019s the main reason we are asking for more. We want to be able to give everyone enough time to fit the weekly quest in with their normal workout routine, and show off to other gym bros that OptiChads get paid to workout. That\u2019s really what this is all about. Growth. Wether it\u2019s a financial or physical or social gain, we make it together. We just hosted a workout in the metaverse in Atlantis\u2019s OP Stadium earlier this week and saw the same kind of effect. Some Chad wannabes (Atlanteans) mentioned they would like us to host the workouts at different times of day so they don\u2019t miss out. So here\u2019s the deal, my bro. We see the need to keep pumping up around the clock, around the world, and around web3. We hear you. Vote us up and bust out those gym shorts that show off your freshly glistened thighs because it\u2019s gonna happen. Let\u2019s keep momentum going and show the other chains how OP does it. ",

In such a short amount of time we were able to achieve both of these goals with incredible success. Our previous grant of 50,000 tokens was delegated straight to the community as @distractionboy has said, improving their gains both physically and financially. It enabled us to extend our reach of our project to people who are unfortunate enough to have no discovered us.

I don\u2019t understand what exactly it is that you are trying to describe in this statement. I am curious because of this users comments. @Dicaso do you have data showing how many of the users for the token rewards were new or first time users of the network in comparison to how many had already used the network? As well as data showing how many of those users both new and existing are still holding the tokens & OptiChads NFT now that the distribution has been completed. Those would be great analytical points to show the retention rate of the users for your project. I am sure the 1000 holders had a positive impact and hope that you will stay Optimistic !!! ",

But never tried Optimism before I came to know about Optichads Quest. That\u2019s the first time I tried optimism and bought an Optichads. Every week, continuously, I was getting OP rewards. Then I called my friend to join with some did at that time because the Op price was 90c not that much at that time and they were not comfortable to try a new network. But recently after the $OP became 2$ then everyone start regretting why they didn\u2019t join. Now everyone who never used Optimism bridged their ETH from mainnet to Optimist and bought Optichads Nfts. They are hoping to join Optichads Quest also. By contunuously using a network in loop, they felt love for it. Especially when they make a good amount of profit from a Project of that network. If you can\u2019t see that much growth in the chart and questioning about it\u2019s effect on helping Optimism\u2019s growth. Did you guys joined Optichads quest? When Dicaso announce the quest whatever the time is people just rushed to complete the quest. Last few weeks, It took maximum 5 - 7 hours to fullfil 714 slots. I love Optichads and never leave it even knowing that there will be no more quests. Only a few people leave about 15% and that\u2019s normal. If I talk about the profit, An Optichads holder earned almost 50 $OP token which currently worth 150$. At that time it was around 50$ and Optichads Nft was valued at 15$-20$. I sold some OP and bought more Optichads and hold and delegate rest of the OP token to participate in governance voting. Thanks for reading  . ",
