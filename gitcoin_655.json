If you dig deeper, you will also see that these outcome squads each develop their own 90 day okrs for each season as well. See more on our FDD Weekly Update slides. More interesting to me is on the left where their diagram shows \u201cContributors\u201d. (Somewhat confusing with the way we use the term for GitcoinDAO.) For FDD, the input to the system has an extra layer here that is similar to the inputs they list as \u201ccontributors\u201d. This is the FDD multisig. It adds a layer of input and protection for the DAO. It helps to convey information and protect resources The FDD multisig comprised of individuals who represent our stakeholders. Some represent the other working groups we connect with the most. Our \u201ccustomers\u201d in a Jobs To Be Done model. (Grants Ops = Annika, Support = Bob) Some represent deep subject matter expertise. (Angela / Token Engeneering Academy, Michael Zargham / Blockscience, Adam Stallard / BrightID) Lastly some to represent the contributors: Armand & Myself.
