It takes time and great talent to develop anything, and the Uniswap team has remarkable talent, and I have faith that this team will continue to develop remarkable, cutting edge products.  It\u2019s not just the dev team, but the management team too, real talent, in a world of copycats, fakers, opportunists, and worse, this team has always taken the high ground, and, now, the holders of UNI are benefiting from that. A discussion should be had over whether this codebase is shared so completely now though.  It is hard to develop, it is easy to take.  Up until now, this has actually helped Uniswap, in my opinion.  But, I don\u2019t feel like complete sharing will help much any longer.  Let\u2019s share code that needs to be shared.  Let\u2019s make sure code is still professionally audited before being released.  But let\u2019s not just hand it out anymore. Thoughts?  Comments? ",

I think one of the biggest strengths in the blockchain system and ethereum in particular is how open everything is. Open source development needs to be encouraged, we need to share. If it\u2019s not so profitable for us who hold tokens I personally don\u2019t care as much. I\u2019m in this not to make money but to be part of something that is much greater than my personal greed. I welcome people taking the code base and doing whatever they want with it. That\u2019s exactly the point of producing public common goods. The scammers are not bringing down the entire system at all, but instead open source makes it easy for anyone to get into it, to try their own thing, to experiment. There are no secrets being kept, the blockchain is not as big as it can be yet. Open source is great at letting people come up with new things everyday and speeding up development greatly. We work together. All of us. ",
