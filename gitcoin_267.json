Updates include: recently electing a new Steward council, Gitcoin recently closed its treasury diversification efforts, our Grants Protocols is live(!) and we\u2019re running two Alpha Rounds on it currently. Also, Gitcoin Passport continues to grow\u2013we recently announced a partnership with Snapshot, and Passport has recently passed over 100k passports created.   Anti-Sybil Legos by j-cook  This post gives a high-level outline of the way FDD is thinking about composable anti-Sybil legos, as Gitcoin moves to the protocol-based grants system. Essentially, Gitcoin depends on Gitcoin Grants, and Gitcoin Grants depends on effective sybil defense. Right now, there are human-powered elements to sybil defense, such as human reviews and using data science tools. In the future, FDD aims to create modular \u201canti-sybil legos\u201d, that \u201ccan also be forked and recombined in creative ways in other projects, making them useful across the whole of Web3, not just within Gitcoin\u201d.   November CSDO Digest by Kyle Jensen  Cross-Stream DAO Operations (CSDO) is a group of workstream and initiative leads that come together to ensure alignment, transparency, and integrity across the DAO.

Read more about the work CSDO is doing with pods, auditing workstream budgets, and the initiative to create a DAO operating system.    This Week\u2019s Content This week, two new posts on the Gitcoin blog, and three new Green Pill episodes from Owocki!   Gitcoin Blog: The power of participating in hackathons  Quinn dispels popular myths about participating in hackathons(such as \u201chackathons are only for developers\u201d). They also explore the benefits of participating in hackathons, such as: gaining experience on technical teams, creating useful products, and landing a job. The post also offers useful tips for those considering participating in their first hackathon.   Gitcoin Blog: Successful grants programs in web3 history  This post is a case-study, sharing best practices from three successful web3 grants programs: Uniswap Grants Program, Aave Grants DAO, and ETH Ecosystem Support Program. It examines some of the difficulties each grants program has faced, and how they created solutions to overcome those difficulties.   Greenpill #70: Circles UBI with Martin Koppelmann Today, we\u2019re speaking with Martin Koppelmann of Gnosis and Circles UBI. Circles UBI is a web-of-trust mechanism for digital identity, which is a necessary primitive for Universal Basic Income.   Greenpill #71: Decentralized Identity with Gregory Rocco of Spruce Kevin speaks with Gregory Rocco of Spruce, which lets users control their data across the web. Gregory is also a massive proponent of sign-in with Ethereum, decentralized identity, reputation, and society.   Greenpill #72: Digital Identity is Not Human Identity with Phillip Sheldrake Greenpill welcomes Philip Sheldrake. Philip is a writer, thinker, educator, and moral philosopher. Philip and Kevin critique the current web3 identity dynamic and how it\u2019s flawed compared to how we actually act in the world. Philip also gives some valuable advice to builders towards the end of the episode.
