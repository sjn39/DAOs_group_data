I plan to reverse that change when Annika returns.   feedback welcome i would like to solicit feedback from you all about how i should change my delegations for S16/S17. pls come to my office hours or fill out this form if you have feedback for me (anon responses ok).  or if you can comment below as long as your comment meets the forum guidelines and code of conduct.  past delegation updates from me:  Q3 2022 Q2 2022 Creating more Transparency into delegations  ",
