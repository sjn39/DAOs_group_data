The price is primarily used for determining the collateral status of loans, but is also used for several other information fields on the application. DDEX would use the v2 medianizer for the same purposes.

This goes against one of our requirements as it would enable 3rd parties who aren\u2019t whitelisted to get access to the Oracle data. If you were to make that function accessible only by your contracts then we can move this proposal forward. ",
