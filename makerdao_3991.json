Here i found some nice web site , that looks like they want to achieve some of the goal we are doing here. https://www.tigweb.org/ Environment , Health, Culture, Education, Technologie, Peace\u2026 I wish John Lennon was here\u2026 Not to make promotion for them, but i found out its good diversification. And also we can compare what they do and what we do. At the end, is all a community that we want to relay, imagine a partnership with one of them, it would be great no ? @rich.brown @Davidutro What you think ? I hope you like it  ",

I wonder what our connection to them would be. Crypto falls under human rights at some level. Especially when you consider an individual\u2019s right to hold custody over their own hard-earned assets. How do you you see us working with this org? Personally, I think it would be cool to involve university programs and students who would be interested in helping contribute to the open-source governance of the protocol and to the interesting problems and decisions we are continuously working through. We have quite a lot of growing to do. ",

When i was reading it, i found it really looking like us, deeper a little bit but still. For me, money , we don\u2019t need. I wish we don\u2019t need money. But imagine you don\u2019t have the money concerns, and you have all these tools close to you ready to go. This have inspired me this morning. I think, it\u2019s the second time i see this. The first time was with you @Davidutro , allowing a grants to me for a hosting event and spreading the words about MakerDAO\u2026 I never seen a website that is willing to give, and want in return, just nothing but hapiness. But also, aim for young people that is willing to go further in their career\u2026 like me i presume and a lot of people here @LongForWisdom Since you guys are really busy with other important things here, un-busy guys like me could manage this. They want to share and teach knowledge, to expand community etc. While we want to expand MakerDAO, i think this fit perfectly in our needs for world developpement.  I would need to get in touch with your Dev team. I am not sure what, but a cooperation between us and them, would be great. I might start to work on that project if you approve it.  ",

There is too much to do now i think to get more involved and start doing business trip etc. But still , and here i seek your advice @Davidutro What about maybe just reserving our seat with them, by that i mean, just to have a foot in the place. Maybe we will never need it, but maybe , after these Holidays, in march, i don\u2019t know, it could be interesting. Then they will remember that we took our name there already. I did read somewhere, when something new is going on, no need to put yourself into it, but , revendicate the name ( our name ) and holding it for now. Maybe if could be interesting. It\u2019s just an idea. I am far away from you into this, so you know what to look for. Give me your opinion please regarding this.  Thanks sir    ",
