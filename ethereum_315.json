Currently, the solutions for Defi or NFTfi are all custodial, which means borrowers have to transfer the ownership of their assets(ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens) to the lending smart contract as collateral to get a loan or liquidity. There are two major concerns about such a mechanism, which are 1. Borrowers can\u2019t make the best use of their assets, such as playing games with NFTs. 2. The security concerns arising out of holding users\u2019 assets by the platforms or lending service providers. EIP-5604 allow borrowers to keep their assets while borrowing at the same time. During the borrowing period, borrowers can still have ownership of their NFT  but may not be able to sell, transfer or dispose of the assets in other ways. Only when liquidation happens, EIP-5604 will be triggered and the target asset will be transferred for liquidation. ",
