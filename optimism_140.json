Yes,     [DRAFT][SO2 Committee Proposal: DeFi: Group C] \ud83c\udfdb Governance       Committee Proposal   Committee Category: DeFi Committee  Our focus is on making the proposal process straightforward for DeFi projects by providing a clear framework and support along the way. Our approach of engaging with proposers, performing solid due diligence & sharing qualified assessments, should help proposers make stronger proposals, facilitate decision-making for other delegates and strengthen the Op ecosystem.  We consider all kinds of DeFi applications and liquidity mining schemes to\u2026     Project description: At least $1.3 billion in MEV has been extracted from users and applications as a result of misaligned incentives that have turned blockchains, the \u201cultimate coordination technology,\u201d into hostile \u201cdark forests\u201d. Intervention from groups such as Flashbots have prevented this massive outflow of MEV from destabilizing blockchain security. But there has been no equivalent effort to give users, builders, and applications the ability to harness or retain the MEV they create, the value that is rightfully theirs. At Rook we believe that for blockchains to thrive, this must change. Everyone \u2013 not just the most sophisticated actors \u2013 should have access to this capability. Blockchains let us own our assets, own our data. Why shouldn\u2019t they let us own our order flow? So we created the world\u2019s first decentralized payment for order flow protocol. Rook has been building in the MEV space since 2020 and we are excited to share our latest iteration with the industry. It lets users, builders, and applications unlock, for the first time, the MEV that belongs to them. It\u2019s a quantum leap for DeFi and for traditional PFOF as well. It\u2019s free to use, accessible to anyone, trustless and decentralized, and maximizes the value returned to users and clients. This is PFOF as a public good, and we want to share it with users and builders on Optimism.

In Future Optimism native?: No Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? MEV is created at the user and application layer but this value is siphoned away to the consensus layer. It is extractive and can be harmful to everyday users on Optimism. Rook wants to democratize this value and return it to the users who create it. Rook hopes that by integrating with Optimism native protocols we will be able to give users more confidence in the execution of their transactions. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Rook has developed infrastructure that brings together users, protocols, and MEV searchers. Protocols that integrate with Rook allow for our network of searchers to identify and capture MEV. The value captured by searchers is then redistributed back to the users. Empirical evidence from transaction data shows large volume traders (whales and institutions) who transact smaller (a few million) sample trades to test Rook\u2019s execution against competing protocols quickly realize Rook\u2019s competitive advantage. Demonstrated in this example of a $110M trade. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Users interacting with protocols integrated with Rook will get paid for their order flow. More money for users, more activity for Optimism. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No. Number of OP tokens requested: 400,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives? Contingent upon a successful governance vote Rook will commit $500,000 for co-investment into our integration partners on Optimism. For example if Rook were to integrate with Velodrome these funds would be used to increase liquidity on their dex. Rook believes in coordination, and we always look for ways to incentivize strategic partnerships - and not just partnerships for profit - but projects and partners aligned to improving the public goods of the Ethereum blockchain. Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? 100% of the OP tokens will be reserved for incentivizing the products of the protocols Rook integrates with on Optimism. Rook thrives when integrated protocols thrive, which is why we will be working with our partners on Optimism and incentivizing their products. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Integration times will vary given each integration is unique to the application. While we would prefer to under-promise and over-deliver, we feel it\u2019s prudent to avoid setting a hard deadline for the claim period of Optimism tokens to ensure the highest priority remains steadfast on the quality of integration over the speed of integration\u2026 Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? Above and beyond protection from predatory MEV exploitation, Rook-enabled protocols on Optimism will be able to offer users the unique incentive of the MEV generated from their own orders! Transacting outside of Rook\u2019s Coordination Layer exposes users to MEV searchers that will extract capital at the user\u2019s expense. Optimism users interacting with protocols integrated with Rook will have their transactions privately broadcasted to our allowlisted keepers. These keepers will search for the MEV of your transaction and rebate 80% of the extractable value back to users on Optimism. This returned MEV can be used in many ways and we expect protocols to get inventive. Users will be incentivized to remain on Optimism because:   The features, functionality and revenue earned through integrating with Rook cannot be found elsewhere outside of Rook integration with Optimism.   Rook returns capital to protocols, applications and users that would otherwise be siphoned away, creating new revenue streams at no added cost or risk to users. Owning your order flow (and being paid for it) from non-inflationary token rebates is unheard of today - and once users get paid for transacting - it becomes the \u201cnew-normal\u201d; as evidenced by our high user retention rate.

Clarify how the tokens will be distributed. Are the reserved as grants for builders to integrated Rook? How much are you allocating per project? What\u2019s the distribution timeline and how many projects are you aiming to onboard? Further clarification will help you get feedback if the amount you are asking is reasonable or need to be changed.  Deploy on Optimism  Private broadcast of trade transactions are important and I don\u2019t see anyone offering this service yet on Optimism.
