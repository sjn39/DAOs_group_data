                    "content": " MONETALIS Evolution  Beginning & Evolution We want to thank the Maker community for all its feedback and work with Monetalis over the past many months. We have learned a lot. When we started engaging with Maker around mid last year, our understanding was that Maker needed fast access to an asset acquisition engine that was professionally managed, for an asset class that would deliver on clean money, that could only be seen as having a positive impact on the economy, and of course was of investment grade risk quality and scalable. And, importantly, managed by someone who would be appropriately flexible in working with Maker as both parties would evolve their knowledge and setup in respect of how to combine off-chain/on-chain governance/control/reporting/etc. To show our intended strong alignment, we sought out MKR holders as key investors. We went for a sizable vault to ensure diversification, economics and, importantly, that it would be a move by Maker that the industry would notice and would kick-start and incentivise asset managers to engage in practice with Maker. We hope the Maker community can see that the above is a straight-forward good faith proposition with intentions of developing a productive Monetalis / Maker collaboration and growing a large RWA balance sheet for Maker. These intentions remain today. However, we clearly did not appreciate a number of Maker dynamics and situations on-the-ground. I think we do now, and have actively made changes to Monetalis setup and strategy to better fit the situation and needs of Maker. One such dynamic was the distractions caused by Rune\u2019s investment in Monetalis, which Rune has kindly helped us resolve in a good way that benefits Maker. We in this note go over our evolved strategy and explain how it fits with revised versions of MIP65 and MIP68 that will be put up for vote in the next governance cycle.  DeFi/TradFi integration Monetalis strategy Before digging into the details we would like to explain one key underlying unique strategic tenet of Monetalis: Our approach to DeFi/TradFi integration is to focus on scaling volumes fast using a solid integration point that requires limited changes to the day-to-day business of both TradFi/DeFi. We do believe the end-state is a thorough on-chain integration between TradFi and DeFi, but we do think it is day-to-day large volumes of capital interactions that will drive this on-chain integration at a very large scale - going from experimentation to mainstream with institutional asset managers. So first volumes, then growing on-chain integration. Let us just clearly state that we both appreciate and agree with Centrifuge, Maple, TrueFi etc strategies of deeper, and faster, on-chain integration between TradFi and DeFi. Our strategy is intended to complement these - not replace. In our view the TradFi / DeFi integration market is today a matter of coopetition rather than competition: all players should be exercising different strategies to increase the overall market size. The white space is immense.  Monetalis Evolution: 3 Component Business Monetalis can be seem, logically, as divided into 3 interacting components:   ARENA: The Off-chain/On-chain, TradFi/DeFi integration point (underlying in both MIP\u2019s)  CLYDESDALE: Integrating financial institutions with DeFi (MIP65)  LUSITANO: Onboarding high-quality investment teams onto DeFi (MIP68)  We will go over each component and explain them and how they connect.  1/ ARENA OFF-CHAIN/ON-CHAIN DEFI/TRADFI INTEGRATION POINT At the outset we had not appropriately appreciated the more nascent and evolving nature of this integration point. We do now and, in fact, believe getting this right is the bedrock upon which to execute our strategic tenet. Some groundbreaking work has been undertaken over the past months/year by Maker and its various RWA partners on this, but as it often is, the more you know, the more you also know, you don\u2019t know. One question answered leads to two new questions unanswered. The issue is both complex and dynamic. We believe we have gotten to a satisfactory and strong starting solution with ARENA, but the important part is that this integration point will require dedicated and constant efforts focused on improving and monitoring it on many levels:   Reacting to regulatory changes and considering jurisdictions and legal format   Working with multiple operational parties (banks, trustee, accounting, auditors) on streamlining and secure operations   Evolving the off-chain/on-chain mapping and functionalities   Evolving governance design   Continued risk management oversight across the operational design Etc.   We believe this integration point is not well-served with a \u201cset and forget\u201d mentality. We intend to put sustained material efforts into evolving ARENA. We believe working with multiple DeFi and multiple TradFi partners - and actively seeking their feedback - is the only way to get this right. Maker is the vital cornerstone partner in the development of ARENA and as such we want Maker to experience clear, immediate, direct benefits of this approach. Continued investments into improving this integration point and deliberately exposing it to multi-protocol operations and asset managers will have a fly-wheel effect and allow faster and safer RWA expansion - and lower cost in the long-run for all parties. We expect Maker to become the largest RWA operation in DeFi, and will benefit the most from this. Appendix ARENA provides further on certain details of the structure, and a separate post on the structure will soon be released.  Onboarding Off-chain Assets onto ARENA The next question becomes how do you ensure good asset management/credit opportunities start committing to working with the integration point and attached protocols. Obviously the quality of the integration point gets us a good part of the way, but we believe more is needed to see true explosive growth of capital flows. We have two specific strategies we will deploy simultaneously: One is essentially \u201cboil a frog\u201d and the other is \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d and they work nicely in synergy: pushing and pulling in TradFi capital flow opportunities towards protocols and building on advantages that emerge from DeFi protocols than can be extended into TradFi. To foreshadow matters, MIP65 is a case of \u201cboil a frog\u201d and MIP68 is a case of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d - and both are solidly anchored on the ARENA integration point design. The next 2 sections will explain these strategic efforts.  2/ CLYDESDALE CONFIDENCE BUILDING & ESCALATING SOLUTION: INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGER INTEGRATION The only credible way for DeFi/TradFi integration to work with top-tier financial institutions seems to be to go slow. The institutions are clearly interested, but there is an instinctive overall discomfort about the risks of crypto on many fronts. You\u2019re basically boiling a frog. Particularly if you want to go through the front door and work with the core of the business. Monetalis \u201cjob\u201d with these financial institutions is to:  Initiate and Manage relationships Create confidence and acceptance of integration point Analyse their offerings and match the right offerings up with the right protocol and needs Operationalise connection/relationship between institutions and protocol via integration point Monitor and report satisfactorily for both parties Continually improve and increase sophistication of solutions and interactions  The analysis, recommendation, monitoring and reporting parts are not dissimilar to traditional fund-of-fund operations, but the operationalization, confidence building, communication and integration point components are DeFi/TradFi unique - and in fact the large job. Why does this job need to be undertaken by a third-party? Clearly large institutions and large protocols have the resources to do this directly? This was our view exactly before starting our journey with MIP65 - but it quickly became very clear an intermediary third-party was necessary: Whilst both protocols and large scale institutions generally want to find grounds for collaboration, things start getting terribly difficult when you get down to practice: fundamentally protocols want the institutions to act as any other on-chain asset onboarding - and institutions want the protocol to act as any other investor - both are only willing to moderate these demands to a very limited degree. The parties are, for now, somewhat miles away from each other. Here are some of our learnings from MIP65:   Decision-making processes are largely non-compatible. One could somewhat \u201ctame\u201d the MIP process to look like an RFP process for an investment mandate, but still quite hard to make work. For instance not one single institution we have met wishes to present themselves or their solution on a public forum with themselves as \u201cdefenders\u201d of the solution. It is hard enough to even convince institutions to allow strategy proposals to become public in the forum for community debate.   Nor do many of them want to discuss details before they see a working and running integration point (ARENA).   Most prefer seeing other professional institutions having onboarded first before submitting a solution with KYC/AML etc solved and this solution working for a substantive period of time.   In addition, most protocols and institutions are largely reactive: i.e. both await someone to approach them. There needs to be such somebody who can act as an appropriately neutral party in-between and create confidence on both sides to accomplish a productive relationship. This reactive nature of the institutions naturally increases the more successful the institution is. It would take a seriously concerted effort and stable years with a working integration point and business flows to provide protocols with access to some of the top performing relevant private funds.   That being said, as soon as confidence is built, the sophistication and scope of solutions - and scale - available from large financial institutions are, of course, outstanding. But to truly get something of this large scale option set, there must be continual communication between institution and protocol - to move towards an optimal match between protocol needs and asset manager solution. This will require a third-party translator and sustained investments in efforts. We must also consider a protocol\u2019s need for diversification (i.e. not all with a single institution) and a need to optimise which institutions to work with for what type of asset classes. This also requires a third-party\u2019s concerted monitoring and analysis. MIP65 Clydesdale is the starting point for growing this solution. It accomplishes the following for Maker:  Sits directly on an ARENA structure Onboards one (or two) large financial institutions and have them provide:  If one, a base strategy of simple, highly liquid, safe bonds via ETF products If two, then also a base customised, liquid, long-term bond strategy via segregated account mechanics   Allow the community to evaluate the above financial institutions and strategies and make a community choice in terms of chosen strategy and partner. Allows Maker to simply expand the sophistication of strategy with same institution Sets out a path to onboard other institutions as their relevant strategic strengths become appropriate for Maker\u2019s ALM strategy. Develops credibility with institutions as a performing, convenient, professional and long-term investor.  More about the details in the relevant appendix. Over the coming few weeks we will put out the above mentioned strategies and institutions for community discussion and vote.  3/ LUSITANO EXAMPLE & INNOVATION: ASSET MANAGEMENT TEAM ONBOARDING The asset management industry has this unique feature that specific investment performance can be attributed almost squarely to a specific investment team and not the institution - and that it is not uncommon that teams move between investment managers or even set up their own fund/manager. We wish to systematically take advantage of this by developing a flexible \u201chouse\u201d/platform on top of the integration point that allows for taking in and managing such teams that have track-record from an asset class that is generally sought across protocols. This brings a number of advantages to DeFi:  Builds an aligned set of TradFi investment teams motivated to take advantage of DeFi protocol advances that can be applied into direct RWA investment product advances. Encouraging a more entrepreneurial stance. Encourages another level of \u201cmixing\u201d DeFi and TradFi capital than usual from interaction with large TradFi institutions - i.e. via partnerships, capital structures and even JV\u2019s. As mentioned earlier a good number of larger financial institutions are not keen on being first movers and want to see what can be done in practice before starting a real relationship. These teams will act as proof - both in terms of actual capital deployment as well as innovation based upon DeFi uniquenesses. \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d.  MIP68 Lusitano is, of course, the start of this. It accomplishes the following for Maker:  Onboards a first team with proven performance in a specific asset class Safely stages first teams deployment in scalable market meeting investment grade standard, in-market structure and return - and meets a min long-term net 2%+ yield requirement to Maker and realise the clean money initiative in practice Built on solid, flexible Bond structure interacting with ARENA - a structure that can be expanded to include further investment teams with other asset class focus and allows appropriate protocol direct insight and oversight via ARENA.  It is further summarised in the relevant appendix.  Quick Recap of the 3 components   CLYDESDALE (workhorse) focuses on TradFi institutions and partnerships herewith and traditional credit/bonds - serving needs of protocols for liquidity, duration and yield. \\   LUSITANO (intelligent, fast and dynamic horse) focuses on Teams onboarding and directing them towards ESG/Green economy opportunities where we believe DeFi RWA deployments can build a substantive market brand and size.   ARENA is the underpinning structure allowing both \u201chorses\u201d to connect to DeFi in a safe, effective and efficient manner.    4/ Q&A\u2019s  Does Maker need these services? Probably it is reasonably simple to understand why many DeFi protocols with RWA aspirations would require some, or all, of the services presented above and that a simple interface for working RWA allocations via something like Monetalis would be advantageous. But why Maker? Couldn\u2019t all this be embedded into CU services? In fairness today probably Maker has some of the most advanced thinking and resourcing on RWA as far as I can tell of all protocols? Actually, we believe, for Maker to exponentially grow with RWA collateral, Maker needs an \u201cand\u201d approach - not an \u201cor\u201d approach. Maker needs the CUs to work on this growth, and Monetalis, and Centrifuge, and 6S, and Oasis Pro, and RWA Co, and Maple, and TrueFi, and many others. All complement each other and, as mentioned, the white space is vast and this truly is a situation of cooptition: Some assets want to go direct to Maker, some need to be coaxed and hand-carried, some want to go on-chain, some do not, some are big, some are small. It requires an ecosystem of Maker aligned interfaces to work productively with the RWA world. And obviously we believe Monetalis can be a valuable one of these. What the optimal structure for \u201cwho does what\u201d becomes in a steady state many years ahead I have no idea - and I don\u2019t think it can be reasonably planned at this moment.  Monetalis Team: enough to execute? The short answer is yes. In more detail:   The team and setup for the first team within the LUSITANO strategy has been ready to go for months. From structure and pipeline etc\u2026 The team have recently, as part of this project, performed due diligence on a set of established, performing portfolio\u2019s to acquire in stage 1 to minimise ramp up risk and found credit funds to partner with for super senior positions. IT infrastructure has been built, Green Economy Program ready etc.   ARENA structures are underpinning both strategies and this starting structure has been equally been ready for implementation for some time. We will be adding in-house resources to this to continue its development. Right now our relationships with legal resources, trustees and professional services is the key thing to coordinate into a practical, implemented solution - which we have adequate resources to develop and project manage.   In this first instance of CLYDESDALE we are simply focused on execution and confidence building with the institutions and Maker. It requires reasonably few resources on and above the ARENA resources. Over the next few months we will be adding further bond portfolio analyst and reporting resources to ensure we can provide appropriate monitoring and advice to Maker.    Where should the Maker Protocol scope of business stop and the ecosystem start? Where does the Core Maker protocol boundary of work and scope of business stop - and the ecosystem start? The answer, of course, is that this boundary is evolving. To ensure that we are on the right side of this boundary as an ecosystem partner we have tried to consider whether our scope of business brings shareable advantages from being multi-protocol rather than single protocol - and, as such, fit better as an ecosystem business than within the scope of a single protocol. We think we meet this metric well in our current scope of business set out in this post.  A/ Appendix ARENA - more details Broadly, the components of a working TradFi/DeFi integration point structure comprise of:  Legal structure & choice of jurisdiction Maker/Protocol Governance package mapping on-chain/off-chain and designed to handle unexpected events. This includes instruction sets, role scoping and the setup of:  Professional Trustee Independent ARENA Committee On-Chain MKR vote   Bank Crypto-exchange Auditor Accountant Service Agent Cash Agent Security/Collateral Agent and/or Custody Reporting and Monitoring package for collateral Reporting and Monitoring on the health of the structure  To eliminate points of failure, each collateral situation must be deliberately separated into unique legal structures and jurisdictions and varied in terms of third-parties used. Specifically:   Lusitano is anchored in a BVI trust using a specific set of servicers. When the debt ceiling reaches DAI 400M, a new structure is set up in a different jurisdiction and a new set of servicers.   Clydesdale is anchored in another BVI trust and specific set of servicers for the first DAI 500M. Next \u201cbullet\u201d/allocation would, as above, dictate the need for new jurisdiction and new set of servicers.   In the end ARENA will consist of many structures that are not entirely copies of each other, but will all share material commonalities. Over the top of these structures monitoring and \u201cupdating\u201d is required: are regulation changes leading a structure to become challenged? Are servicers doing their jobs? Are there better alternatives to consider? Is the governance package working or are matters getting lost? The setup, maintenance, monitoring and adjusting of these structures is not an insubstantial task, but essential for the longevity and health of any sustained large scale TradFi/DeFi off-chain/on-chain integration. The starting point for each structure is a mapping of what process action-set we want the structure to be able to execute on behalf of Maker. And then map where these processes should be anchored in decision-making and practical, secure execution. Lastly then an appropriate set of third-party servicers are engaged to full-fill this map in practice. This is somewhat an iterative process as ultimately certain compromises will have to be made between what third-parties are willing to accept as responsibilities and action-set vs what would be ideal. On top of this a reporting and monitoring package is mapped out. This process and outcome will be illustrated in the appendixes for Clydesdale and Lusitano, where this mapping has been undertaken and has been largely solved for in terms of third-party engagement and reporting/monitoring.  The 3-component Governance Structure A constant in the ARENA solutions, until something better is designed, is a 3-component decision-making structure. It is important to understand this structure and how these components interact:   Professional Trustee Operates on instructions from Maker. An initial set allows Trustee to execute day-to-day transactions, and sets out how further instructions are received/approved from Maker and IC.   Maker Maker must have access, via MKR vote, to instruct the Trustee without constraints.   ARENA Committee A three member independent committee - all approved by Maker. Should have some industry expertise. Whereas the professional trustee safeguards the execution and decision-making processes, the AC is meant to provide oversight, reporting, analysis and recommendations to Maker. A minimal action approval set may be approved for the committee to ensure smooth operations. We set up one such committee per ARENA structure with different individuals. Determining the right legal rights & responsibilities to attach to this committee is still under construction.   Further details will be put in a separate post on ARENA.  B/ Appendix MIP65 Clydesdale - more details As this would be the start of any Maker deployment into institutional bond strategies, the focus here is on simplicity, but with the option to scale and increase sophistication and complexity of the solution (incl. Increasing the number of asset managers to work with). So it works, in essence, like this;   A unique instance of ARENA setup (pending verification of LTS) to fit this situation  All actions mapped out on/off-chain to ensure secure processes exists Third-party services engaged that can work within these processes    An Allocation towards a BlackRock ETF Bond Strategy via Bank Sygnum  Allocation and Strategy to be verified by SF and chosen by Community vote Collateral security to be verified by LTS    Potential Allocation towards a customised Bond strategy with professional asset manager (segregated account/custody)  Allocation and Strategy to be verified by SF and chosen by Community vote Collateral security to be verified by LTS    The community may choose to only allocate towards 2). The reason to include 3) is to start gaining experience with more direct allocations to Asset Managers. A set of options for 2) and 3) will be released to the community shortly for review, consideration and ultimately vote.  C/ Appendix MIP68 Lusitano - more details Lusitano is an evolved version of Monetalis V1/V2 and incorporates further feedback from the Maker community. We will onboard experienced teams with specific credit class proven track-record to build out credit businesses that align with the needs of protocols. Team Approach Each \u201cteam opportunity\u201d are evaluated and structured in the following way:     Dimension Minimum Requirements     Team   At least 1 person (preferably 2) with a successful, attributable, track-record of multiple cohorts of credit of relevant size over a business cycle to act as Principal  Principal shows ability to hire appropriate team-members with relevant adjuvant qualities and experiences At least 1 person with a successful, attributable, track-record of multiple cohorts of credit of relevant size over multiple business cycle to act as Independent Credit Committee Member High-quality, large, private credit decisions are ultimately a product of the appropriate cooperation and necessary tension between the Principal(s) and the Credit Committee and associated processes.   Credit Class Characteristics As can be imagined, different protocols desire different underlying credit class characteristics - and this is ultimately an evolving desire. Our current translation of what appear relevant for Maker, and desirable to Monetalis, can, in short, be described as follows: Whole-sale lending opportunities (i.e. lending to a lender) only* Asset secured lending only - and only assets where proven path of asset acquisition and liquidation exists  Well-established credit market of size and growing.   Senior/Super Senior portion market only  Cross-business cycle performance of <1% loss - and any in-market substantive senior losses are unique and related to specific cases of fraudulent behaviour.  Long-term proof of broad profitability in-market of lenders on a cross-cyclical basis  At current moment provide a net yield long-term target of 2%+ p.a.  Yield positively correlated with inflation.  Only markets where reasonably aggressive terms can be implemented and there is no doubt about our ultimate control of the lending situation. I.e. non-bank lending principally.  Proven to require small team for access, management and scaling using proven set of outsourced third-parties  Selecting the right credit classes are of material importance as its core dynamics in the long-term are as inescapable as gravity. It would not be reasonable to work on that assumption that even the greatest of teams would divert from this in the long-term.   Comp & Skin-in-the-game   Principal\u2019s primary compensation is long-term and directly connected to performance of the built portfolio. Similarly to private equity principals.  Monetalis leaves profit in the portfolio to be reinvested on terms with protocol to ensure a continually increasing alignment. Part of this will be attributed to the Principal(s) as part of compensation. Independent Credit Committee members paid as professionals, but left out of portfolio-related compensation to ensure continued neutrality.    Deployment Pattern To minimise any roll-out and ramp-up risk in getting the team up and performing, we have a standardised staging process with an agreed allocation size per stage. Below is the staging process we have put in place for teams primarily related to Maker credit opportunities: First allocation deployed exclusively against the purchase of existing performing senior, secured portfolios with 50% or less left of duration.   Second allocation is for a pre-agreed funding split between:* Super Senior partnerships with other funders* Further purchases of existing senior secured portfolios* Starting new senior facilities with proven lenders  Third allocation split depends upon the outcome of previous stage and market dynamics Above reduces credit outcome risks dramatically, whilst allowing the team to ramp up operations and show their skills in working profitably across the market.  It is very important to understand that this risk reduction strategy has costs. Stage 1 and stage 2 allocations, due to their lower than average market risk, naturally will require a phase of lower yield than average in market. Much of this lower yield is absorbed by Monetalis in lower than expected profit-share in stage 1 and 2.     Lusitano - ARENA Connector: Bond & Strategic Credit Guidelines Individual team Lusitano team operations are connected to ARENA trusts via relevant lending operation on-shore SPV trusts and bond financing mechanics. It follows a proven structured finance model that provides strong protection and mechanics to the ARENA trust and, by extension, its beneficiary and controller. The most interesting feature of the bond mechanism is that it contains a strategic credit guideline that can be varied by the protocol to control the credit boxes and thus control one or more teams within one bond, ARENA trust structure and vault approval. This makes the practical onboarding of teams very efficient. We note that obviously, in the name of point of failure mediation, not all teams should work via one bond and ARENA trust structure, however this mediation needs to be held up against ensuring efficiency and that the cost of structure do not overpower yield. I.e. Each bond and ARENA trust structure will require a minimum size before a second is set up. At this moment our thumb suck estimate says USD 500M per structure before dialling up another.  Team Alpha: Non-bank lending, senior, secured, green economy Our team alpha is known and has been roaring to go for quite some months now. It has been presented in detail under the Monetalis V2 commentary. We here summarise Team, Market, Comp and Deployment Pattern. We importantly highlight that the deployment pattern have been dramatically altered from Monetalis V1/V2 to fit with the staged risk reduction pattern established above - and that George Ashworth have been finally confirmed and added to our starting team:     Dimension Team Alpha     Team  Principals & Team   George Ashworth - Independent Credit committee Member: 40 years experience in executive roles for large banks financing operating in this industry sector. Former MD of Santander and ABN AMRO asset finance businesses. Former Chairman of the Asset Finance Board in the UK Finance & Leasing Association  Hywel Prewett - Head of Portfolio Management: 15 years in industry. Built two wholesale non-bank lending books from zero: Aldermore Bank: GBP 230M, Hampshire Trust Bank: GBP 150M. Served as Block Discount account manager at Siemens Financial services  2 x Credit Analysts: Over 10 years experience in Block Discounting. Previously 4 years experience at BNP Paribas   Finance Controller: Over 6 years as finance controller for non-bank lender, supporting operations over 6 different SPVs (Institutional lenders). Qualified management accountant    External Advisor Panel Legal: DLA Piper   Addleshaw Goddard  Reed Smith  Clients portfolio audits:   IAA  T. Mistry & Associates  Biz Dev Partners:  Grant Thornton  Quilam  Arrow Global     Market A large amount has already been written about this market and presented to the community:  MIP6: Monetalis  MIP68: Monetalis Lusitano  It remains attractive for all the reasons explained and should perform well in an inflationary setting.   Comp In line with market best practice and with the criteria adopted for the Principal, compensation will follow these principles:  The Independent Credit Committee member is paid as professionals to ensure continued neutrality.  Head of portfolio management and key analysts will receive a salary and a variable compensation that will be linked to the long term performance of the portfolio. Largest component is the variable performance component.    Deployment Monetalis Lusitano Deployment strategy have been altered to match the principles set out above to minimise ramp up risks:   Stage 1: Only refinance of existing portfolios / DAI 50M The team is in the final stages of negotiating a number of portfolio refinancings. All non-bank lenders we are working with on this have impeccable track records, as well as current and historic portfolios that meet our stringent requirements relating to maximum capital losses and defaults etc. - and fit within our strategic credit guidelines. Specifically this pipeline consists of:   Block Discount facility: ~\u00a315m existing portfolio of recently deployed and well performing loans disbursed for the refurbishment of properties in the South West of England.   Revolving Credit facility: ~\u00a35m existing portfolio of asset backed loans. The loans are supported by EVs on a 2-year amortisation period, licensed to Uber drivers operating in London.   Revolving Credit facility: ~\u00a310m existing portfolio of asset backed professional loans. These loans are extended to well established Opticians, Dentists and Law practices.   Block Discount facility: ~\u00a320m existing portfolio of property-backed loans issued to support the refurbishment and development of properties across the UK.  We will be refinancing positions of other wholesale lenders such as Shawbrook Bank, Paragon Bank and Triple Point. All very credible and performing wholesale lenders in the UK.   The above opportunities represent a small number of deals that are expected to come to fruition in the short term.  We note that this refinancing comes at interest rates of between 3% and 4.5% depending on the type of facility being refinanced. This is 20% to 35% lower than the rates we would normally charge. That is the cost of this extra safety of buying into existing, performing portfolios rather than starting new facilities.  Stage 2: Super-senior partnerships & Refinance / DAI 50M  For stage 2, the team will continue to work with refinancing as in stage 1 - and adding a few super-senior lending facilities with top-tier funds and banks active in this market and within the strategic credit guidelines. Given the required size for these super-senior relationships we may only be able to deliver 1 and very few refinancings within the DAI 50M frame. We are in advanced negotiations with three different parties for a super-senior facility:   London-based mezzanine fund: This fund is well known in the UK market, with over \u00a34BN AUM and a large stake in a lender specialising in large development loans for Green, retirement and Social housing solutions.  Manchester-based fund: The fund has over \u00a36BN AUM and is linked to one of the largest UK lenders specialising in Property loans (bridging and development). This is of particular interest to Monetalis as many loans are being deployed for the refurbishment of old government buildings with the view of meeting new environmental standards.  UK Challenger bank: With over \u00a310BN AUM and an established presence in the SME lending space, this partnership would represent an important milestone for Monetalis (and MakerDAO).  Stage 3: Incremental growth / Vault increase required We forecast that the non-bank lenders on-boarded through Stage 1 and Stage 2 can generate \u00a320M-\u00a330M in Senior and Super-senior new monthly originations should a vault increase be granted. We can then expand from there.    Team Pipeline We have not yet moved to far out with our Team offering, but believe over the coming 6 to 12 months we will be able to source and start a staged deployment with:  Project Finance Team focused on Green Energy Scandinavian Wholesale lending Team Central EU Wholesale lending Team Manufacturer Leasing focused Wholesale funding team  ",

All complement each other and, as mentioned, the white space is vast and this truly is a situation of cooptition: Some assets want to go direct to Maker, some need to be coaxed and hand-carried, some want to go on-chain, some do not, some are big, some are small. It requires an ecosystem of Maker aligned interfaces to work productively with the RWA world. And obviously we believe Monetalis can be a valuable one of these.   The evolution of this DAO will always be enduring. It is a continuous evolution for those who have made the commitment of solving this complex problem of scaling a decentralized organization. Challenging it is, and hopefully rewarding for those who are willing to evolve. As someone who enjoys being informed, I\u2019m hearing that institutional back offices are focus on dissolving their exposure to any Russian exposure/investments. While we are aware that their number one priority is not to scale RWAs via MakerDAO, I worry that this community is too complacent on waiting for institutional partnerships to start pouring in. We must recognize that those institutional back-offices will always be overwhelmed with other important matters that do not pertain to MakerDAO. And because of the institutional focus on what is important to them and not MakerDAO, we must not forget the innovators who are evolving\u2013patiently waiting for the DAO to provide them with runway. The pioneers that are trying to solve the scaling of RWAs via an off-chain & on-chain approach, they need to be onboarded. Let\u2019s not sit around and wait for the institutions to come knocking on the DAO\u2019s door. We must evolve now.     Allan_Pedersen:  Stage 1: Only refinance of existing portfolios / DAI 50M The team is in the final stages of negotiating a number of portfolio refinancings. All non-bank lenders we are working with on this have impeccable track records, as well as current and historic portfolios that meet our stringent requirements relating to maximum capital losses and defaults etc. - and fit within our strategic credit guidelines. Specifically this pipeline consists of:  Block Discount facility: ~\u00a315m existing portfolio of recently deployed and well performing loans disbursed for the refurbishment of properties in the South West of England. Revolving Credit facility: ~\u00a35m existing portfolio of asset backed loans. The loans are supported by EVs on a 2-year amortisation period, licensed to Uber drivers operating in London. Revolving Credit facility: ~\u00a310m existing portfolio of asset backed professional loans. These loans are extended to well established Opticians, Dentists and Law practices. Block Discount facility: ~\u00a320m existing portfolio of property-backed loans issued to support the refurbishment and development of properties across the UK.    I might have missed this on one of your posted MIP applications, but can you please go over how your team will handle the currency risk of going DAI \u2192 USD \u2192 GBP? Thank you in advance. ",

Do you intend to have any direct lending operations or is this more of a implementation of the arena connector to put MKR funds to use? I think it\u2019s good to try different things but I wonder if at some point MKR might want to standardize the way they want to integrate with RWA.  Groups like centrifuge, 6s, Monetalis all seem to be coming up with their own SPV structures to handle the interface.  Seems like a lot of redundant work.  But at this point maybe we need to try different things to see what works best. So far, I personally like the centrifuge representation of asset value as tokens.  One concern I have about what Monetalis is doing is that it seems a little murkier where the funds are actually going.  Every centrifuge vault is made for a very specific collateral type.  The descriptions for Lusitano and Clydesdale seem to be a more generic \u201cliquid bond strategy\u201d or \u201cgreen strategy\u201d where more trust is placed on the team and Maker has less visibility into actual investment choices.  But maybe you\u2019re saying the protocol needs less micromanaging and RWA collaborators should have more flexibility in investment strategies in order to deploy capital more efficiently.  That is definitely going  to invite more scrutiny on your teams.  For me, I kind of like knowing more clearly the collateral behind each vault. I\u2019m a huge supporter of bond strategies but how do we want it implemented?  Do we want to be super specific where you have a vault for every type of treasury bond (1 year, 2 year, 5 year, inflation protected)?  Probably too specific there.  But maybe a vault for short term treasuries, corporate bonds, junk bonds?  Or vaults for bond strategy implemented by xx team, yy team, zz team? @Allan_Pedersen Feel free to clarify if I read this incorrectly.  I\u2019m just trying to envision what the end result will look like on Maker\u2019s end. ",

Traster_Tray:  Do you intend to have any direct lending operations or is this more of a implementation of the arena connector to put MKR funds to use?   Monetalis Lusitano is senior secured lending to Non-bank lenders in the UK (who then lends to businesses) under a specific strategic credit guideline (set out in MIP68) - I think would qualify as direct lending? Monetalis Clydesdale is more a \u201cfund-of-fund\u201d business - i.e. allocating to appropriate asset managers and managing the structure/reporting etc\u2026     Traster_Tray:  I think it\u2019s good to try different things but I wonder if at some point MKR might want to standardize the way they want to integrate with RWA. Groups like centrifuge, 6s, Monetalis all seem to be coming up with their own SPV structures to handle the interface. Seems like a lot of redundant work. But at this point maybe we need to try different things to see what works best.   At some stage yes I am sure, but at this momement, with regulations etc in flux, it is better we have redundancies - i.e. several different satisfying solutions. You will also over the coming 12 months see the SPV/Governance solutions to start having various common features in governance etc. I believe RWF/LTS are working on some standardisation of a certain number of these features.     Traster_Tray:  One concern I have about what Monetalis is doing is that it seems a little murkier where the funds are actually going.   Not murky!: for Clydesdale specific asset managers will come with specfic bond strategies and put up for community vote - in fact the first proposal and analysis of a strategy by Baillie Gifford should come out over the next few days for vote and they are teed up for an AMA with the community over next week to explain and answer questions on their strategy. That is about as transparent as I make it I think. And Lusitano is steered strictly by a strategic credit guideline \u201cbox\u201d set by Maker to match the relevant team - and each team could be connected to a separate vault if it made functional sense. I do agree that it would be good to give more and more freedom to RWA collaborators (maybe in a staged format) - give them room to excel at what they do and I think would be inline with the principles of decentralisation. I think the Arranger idea and some of the newer long-term thinking about MakerDAO is somewhat pointing in that direction as well.     Traster_Tray:  I\u2019m a huge supporter of bond strategies but how do we want it implemented? Do we want to be super specific where you have a vault for every type of treasury bond (1 year, 2 year, 5 year, inflation protected)? Probably too specific there. But maybe a vault for short term treasuries, corporate bonds, junk bonds? Or vaults for bond strategy implemented by xx team, yy team, zz team?   I was actually thinking 1 vault and then allocate amounts of the vault to different asset managers under different strategies (after approval of said asset managers and strategy). Had not thought say one vault per asset manager. I am not sure what we would gain from having multiple vaults in this particular case when using MIP21, but I will have think about it. If it adds value to separate into more than one vault, then we do that of course. Other thoughts/questions please do let me know. ",

Some of my questions are also trying to gauge where the rest of the community stands but I\u2019m mostly in agreement with your comments.  In terms of the murky comment, it\u2019s helpful to know the extra details on implementation such as the credit guideline box or allowing community vote on bond strategies.  I also acknowledge that one of your points was that some of these lenders would probably not involve themselves with Maker without an intermediary like Monetalis reaching out. Still you are one level removed from the actual SME\u2019s being lent to so maybe that\u2019s where my concern is.  Do you think you can still provide visibility into the collateral or is it more your stance that it\u2019s enough to find quality lenders?  I think it also means you\u2019ll be managing numerous liquidation strategies that have to flow back to MKR.  Part of my discomfort is that MKR started out as a direct consumer facing lender to crypto users, then RWA came into the picture and it became an interface to RWA lenders, and now Monetalis is proposing to be a lender that reaches out to other RWA lenders.  This does mean some loss of control but I understand this is maybe what needs to happen to grow.  if Monetalis is successful here, it would become very important to the protocol and I think it will come down to how much MKR can trust your intentions, judgements, and your decisions. It sounds like you are trying to make things transparent and open to feedback and I think that\u2019s probably most important.  Personally, I like the ideas and the potential and I\u2019m hoping you will succeed in becoming another trusted partner to the protocol. ",

                    "content": "Dear @Traster_Tray , the Wholesale lender model that Monetalis is planning to execute is very well known and offers a high degree of control and visibility over the selection of lenders, underlying loans being disbursed as well as the collateral offered as a guarantee. I will start by illustrating the control we have on the quality of the lenders and the underlying assets, I will then illustrate how a robust framework has been put in place to continuously monitor the quality and performance of our portfolio. Finally, I will provide you with an overview of the process required in the unlikely event of a lender\u2019s default. It is important to note that what we are describing below is market-standard practice, we are not introducing novel/risky products and frameworks, we are adopting a proven market model, one our team and external advisors are very well versed in.  1361\u00d7530 26.8 KB  Acceptance: A. MakerDAO and Monetalis agree on stringent Strategic Credit guidelines for the selection of the lenders as well as the characteristics and quality of the underlying assets; B. Monetalis uses its extensive network and experienced team to select established lenders with the necessary track record, experience, products and origination channels. C. The identified lenders will go through a thorough commercial and legal due diligence before a facility can be agreed and a facility letter can be issued. At a high level the two due diligences cover the following:  Commercial due diligence:  Financial stability of the company Business strategy including: Market segments, product range, origination Financial forecasts Management roles Team structure Key policies and processes Portfolio analysis: LGD, defaults, IRR, concentrations, av tx size, etc.   Legal Due diligence:  Company searches, legal structure and UBOs Borrowing covenants Red flag review of customer contracts Red flag review of security documentation Review of deed of release Review of deed of assignment Sense check of indicative terms    The two due diligences will be used to formulate the facility letter and will contain a series of conditions designed to enforce the right level of quality and security, These controls generally (but are not limited to) the following:  Condition precedent Performance covenants Concentration thresholds Back-up servicing  Facility letters containing the above conditions will be produced by our legal partners who have decades of experience in this market and have managed hundreds of similar transactions. If you are interested in the strength of the instruments we put in place with our lenders, I would encourage you read the review by Andrew Maskill, Partner, Addleshaw-Goddard that he did for this project here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1koJEv7rYknQljT6oxTE54K3UARjxlp7f/view?usp=sharing When a loan is disbursed, ownership of the asset is immediately transferred to Monetalis and all the associated documentation is uploaded onto our platform when a funding request is submitted. All facility agreements require approval of the standing Monetalis Credit Committee. The credit committee consists of 3 individuals. 2 from Monetalis and 1 independent. All facility approval requires unanimous agreement of the members of the committee. MakerDAO has the right to approve/reject the proposed independent committee member. Monitoring:  The monitoring oversight of the portfolio is carried out through two committees:    Credit Committee: This is responsible for:  Approving new facilities and or refinance of existing portfolios; Assessing the on-going adequacy of the credit guidelines adopted and reviewing them based on market trends; Assessing the overall portfolio performance; Authorising any new products, markets or change in strategy.    Audit Committee: This committee will ensure that information relating to the value of the underlying assets, cover ratios as well as performance and financial KPIs are accurate, timely and complete.    In order to ensure that Lenders adhere to the conditions dictated in the facility letter, we have implemented a strong operational monitoring and control framework, which includes:  Monthly monitoring:   Collection account: Our proprietary platform will link via Open Banking APIs to collection accounts used by lenders to monitor loan disbursals and loan collections;   Loan portfolio: Lenders will also be required to submit monthly portfolio data via our platform   Triple-lock reconciliation: Loan collections and portfolio data will be automatically reconciled against what we expected to have collected for every loan   In the event of any covenants being breached, our platform will automatically raise alerts and the lender will be required to provide \u201creplacement paper\u201d or inject cash into the facility to cover the gap. Quarterly monitoring:  On a quarterly basis one of our external auditors will carry out an on-site due diligence. Using the loan documents and portfolio data submitted, they will carry out a sample check to verify that:  The security asset is real and that the correct process was followed to value it; The loan was disbursed according to the information provided and all the necessary contracts and supporting documentation are valid; Operational processes and policies (underwriting, disbursals, collections, etc) are being adhered to.    Collections: Before providing you with an overview of our collections process in the event of a default, let me first provide you with a description of the layer of security established at the onset of a new relationship to provide substantial protection for Monetalis and MakerDAO.  Monetalis is a Senior, and in some instances Super-Senior, wholesale lender. This means that Monetalis only advances between 60% and 85% of the loan extended to a borrower by a lender and these end-borrower loans are always over-collateralised (i.e. the end-borrower can borrow up to 60 to 80% of the value of the pledged underlying asset). As a result of this, the cover ratio between the money provided to fund a loan by Monetalis/MakerDAO and the value of the underlying security ranges between 150% to well over 200%; Every lender is required to provide \u201cfirst loss\u201d coverage through a mezzanine/junior facility or equity. This varies from 15% to 25% for senior lending and more for super-senior lending. The lenders we deal with are all well established and have substantial equity to support first loss position; Monetalis will have a full and floating charge on the lending SPV and will have a cross guarantee on the lender\u2019s main legal entity; Every lender will be required to establish a back-servicing relationship before a facility can be activated; The ownership of all loan contracts will be transferred to Monetalis at the point of funding; Should any facility covenants be breached at any time, Monetalis has the right to stop any further lending and put the facility into run-off and take over the practical execution of this run-off.  In the very unlikely event that a lender should fail, Monetalis will:  Instruct the Back-up Servicer hired by the lender to collect from borrowers on behalf of the lender. A provision to pay for the Back-servicer is accrued during the life of the facility extended by Monetalis to the lender. As Monetalis will have 1st charge on the SPV, collections will be used to repay Monetalis\u2019 facility first; In the event of a borrower defaulting on the loan, the Back-up servicer will enforce on the underlying security.  We have an upcoming Q&A session, should you have any additional queries or require further clarifications on the above, I will be more than happy to discuss this. ",
