If a project has raised money (through either token or VC), most likely I won\u2019t be voting for that project. If a project has a great idea but is just starting to see impact, I will vote for them with the thinking that supporting a great idea is a good thing. And hopefully the support will help that team to execute on the idea in the future. (Yes, I know this is supposed to be retro-active, but see below\u2026) If a project has already had impact, I think that\u2019s excellent and deserves support, but many times early impactful things fade in the long run. Use Yahoo as an example. It had a huge impact in the early Internet, but it faded to insignificance. I\u2019m not sure past impact is a good measure. Also, there\u2019s a winner-take-all aspect to all of this. Everyone votes for \u201cwell known projects\u201d and then \u201cwell known projects\u201d become more well known because they have a marketing budget, spiral, spiral\u2026 For these reasons, I think I\u2019m going to do something similar to this.   Identify project that I won\u2019t be voting for due to already existing funding through VCs or token raises. Allocate 0% to those projects.   Identify the 10-20 projects that either have great future potention and growing impact or past impact and a really good idea. Allocation about 50% of my vote to those project split up in a way that makes sense.   Use the remaining 50% of my vote to vote evenly across the remaining projects in the belief that even 1% of my vote (or whatever it works out to) is a significant amount of money, and especially for small projects, any amount of money keeps them going and is a huge encouragement.

Latest results for alpha round is here  docs.google.com    Final Matching Calculations for January Gitcoin Alpha Rounds OSS...
