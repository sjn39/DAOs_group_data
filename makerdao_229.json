                    "content": "See previous signal and discussion for context. I\u2019ve covered why I think higher compensation than initially proposed is necessary elsewhere, but to summarize:  We are not attracting any new delegates at the 48k max offered compensation. Existing recognised delegates are quitting and / or taking positions elsewhere in the industry. We really need a wider selection of delegates than what we currently have in order to avoid a heavy centralization of voting power in very few hands. The trial expires after 3 months, meaning that any undue negative results will be temporary. In our judgement we cannot safely and consistently govern the protocol without additional active voters. Delegation is the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to attracting additional active voters. Overpaying is vastly preferable to having a non-functional delegate and governance ecosystem, so we should lean towards failing on that side of the spectrum (overpaying, having delegates) than on the other side of the spectrum (underpaying, having no delegates.)     Should we increase Maximum Delegate Compensation as described in MIP61 to 144k DAI for the initial 3 month delegate compensation trial?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     If this signal passes then the maximum delegate compensation will be set to 144k DAI at a level of 10K MKR as described in MIP61. Note that this compensation is only offered to Recognised Delegates that meet a threshold of 90% participation and communication. Next Steps This signal poll will be active until 2021-11-04T00:00:00Z, if successful it will proceed to an on-chain poll on the subsequent Monday. ",

                    "content": "I have not had time to complete my analysis so it is difficult to say anything without looking at wallet participation here. My impression is that we are getting more consistent voting from delegates but the issue is MKR is leaving governance generally. I still want to do an analysis but I am rapidly coming to a general conclusion that if Maker wants governance participation then it should seriously consider rewarding with either DAI equivalent of MKR or MKR directly to the tune of .1% of the existing MC.   This reward should be across the board for all MKR voting and to facilitate delegation for people who have a small amount of MKR something like a 50% pass through reward for delegates 50% to the delegator.  These rewards would be based on poll and executive vote participation. I honestly don\u2019t see any other solution that aligns interests punishing MKR holders that are not participating in governance, and rewarding those who do consistently participate.   Rewards have to be linear because the guard of the hat is a linear MKR function.   Doing anything like quadratic rewards here just punishes large MKR holders. Taking existing governance data and running it through my own analysis to produce what I call a \u2018wallet_importance\u2019 metric (separated poll and executives) so the rewards can be weighted appropriately i think is important. Also I don\u2019t know if  anyone has reviewed a chart of MKR in governance since inception but the graph seb has only goes back to 1/1/2021.   Go back further and we see governance late in 2020 had 350K MKR in it.  Sebs chart has more up to date data indicating further MKR leaving governance which confirms a general downtrend in MKR in governance. Apologies for the lack of labels here - this was just a first pass on the data for a quick look at how much MKR had in governance from inception till now before I sat and finished my data restructuring to be able to calculate my wallet_importance metrics and to analyze all wallets over all time behaviors in governance.  image1078\u00d7489 5.64 KB  I just found it particularly interesting that MKR in governance continued to grow up until the end of 2020.    An interesting correlative analysis would be of the wallets holding MKR over time as well but that is for another analytical pass. The chart I have is not up to date but you can see @SebVentures chart within mine for 2021. I think since this whole delegate compensation thing, and governance participation is rising in importance I am going to priortize my analytic work to see if I can get some basic form of my own GovAlpha report out within next 2-4 weeks.   My own basic analysis of the situation is that there is a proper alignment of governance interests if rewards that dilute all MKR holders to compensate governance participation via some defined participation metric.   Making it so small players can delegate their MKR to one delegate and get the participation performance of the delegate via a ~50% reward pass through actually can help bring in smaller players to delegation.  BTW:  rewards can vest and either MKR sold to compensate in DAI or MKR simply paid out.  .1% of entire float is approx 1000MKR which corresponds to 2.5M/yr to compensate ALL MKR either voting or delegating to vote.   This is not a huge number and the pass through via MKR delgated to delegates as \u2018their pay\u2019 (which can have an additional adjustment component via some moderate delegate compensation along the lines of the first MIP) isn\u2019t unreasonable. The issue is that MKR in governance in the past has not been willing to dilute itself even to compensate itself for voting.    I think the idea of rewarding governance participation with a component linear to MKR being voted multipled by a performance factor between 0 and 1 with a weighting component for polls and executives is probably the fairest and best model to encourage governance participation.   .1% (or 1000MKR equivalent in value) is cheap to get people in here voting.   with 1/2 of the delegate capture going to delegate compensation potentially a great way to get smaller MKR holders to delegate and earn some return protecting the system via their favorite delegates.

As for the role and responsibilities of delegates, this is a really complicated question because the main function that delegates have today, is spending time and attention where MKR holders have none. As a result, MKR holders may not have the time and attention to define exactly what they want from delegates either, let alone check on them to see if they\u2019re doing a good job. So the delegates have to be kept in check by another mechanism. And we don\u2019t know what that mechanism is.

Didn\u2019t check to regroup wallets owned by the same entity in the past, it\u2019s time-consuming.   This data is misleading. Governance participation (in terms of MKR weight) decreased with the introduction of delegates because the VC\u2019s no longer needed to vote in order for governance to function. Prior to this, @prose11 and I were hassling them every other day to get the votes that we required to keep Maker functioning. The VC\u2019s do not want to vote each week, they would rather delegate. They can\u2019t delegate yet because custody platforms haven\u2019t integrated with the delegation contracts. At least one VC would rather delegate to Recognised Delegates than shadow delegates and signalled an intention to spread their voting power amongst \u2018proven\u2019 recognised delegates. The only reason we stopped having to chase the VC\u2019s was that another large MKR Holder was willing to engage with the delegation contracts without going though custody platforms. They delegated to a few of the Recognised Delegates as opposed to the shadow delegates. Recognised Delegates offer more transparency, more accountability and a road to actual decentralization of effective governance power. Shadow delegates do not have those advantages. ",

I\u2019m being honest. There\u2019s an onslaught of DAOs coming up and people have sooo many choices. I\u2019m here in Lisbon and I can\u2019t even tell you how many folks are trying to onboard themselves to communities. And most are not thinking \u201cMakerDAO\u201d. It\u2019s an after thought. So how do we attract talent? I spoke to a VC who shall remain nameless, and they want DAOs to recruit the top-notch talent and pay new talent more than what OGs are currently being paid. Because they believe that in order to get top-notch talent to leave the Googles, Facebooks of the world \u2014 you need to pay up, not down. I think we all know that. Also, the VC wants to know\u2014why in the world are DeFi protocols not putting their treasury to work? Why sit on $300M and not hire top-tier talent that can help you scale 100x? Now to your point @Katie there should be KPIs, deliverables, etc. \u2014 but we can\u2019t get the top notch talent to become Maker Delegates if we don\u2019t incentivize properly. And I don\u2019t have the right answers but I think folks like Coopah Troopa and Aragon really get it, and the talent is listening to them, not us:    Spotify    All You Need to Know About DAOs in 2021 - Cooper Turley, Ep. 168 Listen to this episode from Blockcrunch: Global Crypto Investors on Spotify.

Maybe MKR holders will delegate to you because you volunteer to receive less compensation. I bet @LongForWisdom could incorporate that option into the current trial without any need for more governance polls etc. It would be a simple change to MIP61 too.     twblack88:  I\u2019m thinking of minimums not caps   The thing is, you might be a much more brilliant delegate than you think you are. It\u2019s up to MKR holders to decide, no? Suppose you volunteer to receive a max comp of 24k DAI per year and you make great decisions. Why shouldn\u2019t MKR holders be allowed to delegate a total of 20k or 30k or more MKR to you? ",
