Plenty of content has been gathered from within SES too, but I do believe there is still great content out there that is just hidden or not easily accessible. So, I invite all of you to come have a look at this table and try to post what you think is missing and is relevant for someone that would like to learn more about MakerDAO. You can see the table here and be able to add a comment with links to the material: https://makerdao-ses.notion.site/Educational-Material-436f19a0325146438d3969d0afa58f09 Thank you ",
