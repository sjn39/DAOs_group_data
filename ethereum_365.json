For post-block-inclusion, there is EIP-6404. The new signature scheme proposed here is close to what the \u201cSSZ Union\u201d approach in Vitalik\u2019s notes / EIP-6404\u2019s test section is referring to, so it doesn\u2019t conflict with the approach based on \u201cSSZ Union\u201d. For \u201cSSZ Normalized\u201d approach, the transaction\u2019s mempool encoding is not linked to the post-block-inclusion encoding, so there is no concern either. ",
