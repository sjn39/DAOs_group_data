Isn\u2019t this the equivalent of blaming the part of the population that did vote (in a democracy) instead of the apathetic voters? As much as we enjoy the pitchforking and pointing fingers, I am yet to see any Maker contributor bring forward a robust open framework that we can use.  Did anyone say Framework? During the last several months, we have seen a strong focus on deal-making and deal-criticizing in the RWA arms.  Someone on the deal-criticizing side could have a hidden agenda to prioritize their own deals, which is why Governance (this is especially true for the non-experts like me) has a hard time separating the drama from the facts. I\u2019ve mentioned the need for a RWA Framework over a year and a half ago, and in spite of Maker having spent a lot (millions?) on several experts with very prestigious backgrounds, I don\u2019t feel we have advanced a lot. Maybe Luca\u2019s LOVE came close? PS: I\u2019m not even close to being an expert on RWA, and I do not intend to become one; hence my passiveness and \u201cplease, someone, come up with a framework\u201d instead of doing it myself.  Did anyone say Endgame? But wait, there\u2019s more! Some good news: Endgame is aiming to work on frameworks through scopes. We\u2019ll start facilitating this framework (and others) to ensure that the risk is assessed and managed openly. You (and anyone willing to participate) will be invited to join and contribute. Hopefully, the expertise of all the RWA experts we have around will bring Maker\u2019s game to the next level. ",

The key difference is that MakerDAO is a plutocracy, not a democracy. Incentives to vote scale quadratically with the amount of MKR someone holds(big holders both have more impact on MKR price and are more impacted by MKR price). If a system structurally favors certain people, then those people do bear more responsibility. As for a RWA framework: target 70% of RWAs into short term US treasuries, with the remaining 30% in stablecoins. That would give us quite a bit of revenue in a very safe, easy to understand way. Minimal room for hidden agendas. ",

That is a very large gap to cross. At best, smaller whales are in a prisoners dilemma where it is only in their best interest to vote if other whales coordinate votes with them. Also, voting whales are making themselves easier targets for lawsuits. So they need to be pretty confident they can achieve something before they vote. ",

My points:  A plutocracy is not a democracy (for better and worse) voter apathy is real (in both situations) going after the people actually voting, delegating, or caring, doesn\u2019t seem to solve the apathy (if anything, the opposite: if Rune stopped delegating, voting, or showing up, who\u2019s the next whale? Should we say that they have a supermajority and blame them because of the \u201cnature of centralization\u201d?) After spending millions we still don\u2019t have a solid framework for implementing RWA we should definitely work towards fixing these problems (ideally bringing forward proposals instead of finger-pointing)  ",
