Project description: dHEDGE was one of the early projects that worked with the Optimism team to improve the dev experience, prior to the Regenesis. Since launching on Optimism over 6 months ago, dHEDGE has been rapidly increasing integrations with other Optimism protocols Aave, 1inch, Kwenta and Uniswap, in addition to launching our own incubated protocol Toros Finance on Optimism in April. We\u2019ve also passed governance proposals for new integrations with Beethoven X, Velodrome and Lyra. Our protocol vision is to build a future where everyone has simple and reliable access to financial freedom so that society\u2019s quality of life is improved. This is tightly aligned with the Optimistic Vision of reliably providing for basic human needs at scale.

A similar project on other chains in Enzyme Finance - this also enables non custodial asset management but has a focus on indices. Enzyme is on mainnet and Polygon. Is/will this project be open sourced?: The smart contracts and automation infrastructure are fully open sourced dHEDGE DAO \u00b7 GitHub. Optimism native?: No Date of deployment on Optimism: November 29, 2021 Ecosystem Value Proposition: dHEDGE brings decentralised asset management to Optimism, and is integrated with many current OP projects e.g. Aave, 1inch, Synthetix/Kwenta, Uniswap and soon Lyra, Beethoven and Velodrome. Using these integrations, dHEDGE has incubated a new protocol Toros Finance, which runs automated strategies on Optimism including the Synthetix Debt Hedging service, which has quickly accrued over $3.5m in TVL weeks after launching. It\u2019s a valuable service seeing rapid adoption from the SNX staking community. A decentralised asset management platform, combined with our native SDK, is a valuable asset for the Optimism ecosystem as it enables asset managers access to easy automation potential combined with a safe non-custodial management solution. This value can be demonstrated by the $4.3m TVL already locked in the protocol. Additionally, $OP incentives will help migrate more funds across from dHEDGE on mainnet as we migrate governance from mainnet to L2. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? dHEDGE previously applied for a grant in Phase 1, Cycle 4 and was asked to resubmit with an altered $OP distribution model. Specifically, the previous submission involved a distribution model targeted towards holders of DHT, the dHEDGE governance token.  We\u2019ve modified the $OP distribution such that users don\u2019t need to stake DHT to be eligible, We\u2019ve revised the $OP ask down from 500,000 to 350,000, and Split the distribution between pool incentives (70%) and liquidity mining (30%)  These revisions bring our proposal into line with the feedback we received on previous submission.     [READY] [GF: Phase 1 Proposal] dHEDGE Governance Fund: Phase 1   Snapshot vote - not-passed     Number of OP tokens requested: 350,000 OP How much will your project match in co-incentives? We\u2019re proposing to split the distribution of granted $OP across DHPT Pool Incentives (70%) and Liquidity Mining (30%). The Liquidity Mining will be matched 1:1 with DHT, but not the DHPT Pool incentives. Proposal for token distribution: We\u2019re proposing a multi-channel distribution model as follows:  Pool incentives (70%)  We propose distributing $OP tokens to holders of whitelisted dHEDGE Pool Tokens (DHPT) on Optimism. This method of distribution aims to incentivise liquidity into dHEDGE pools. DHPT holders would receive a portion of $OP tokens relative to their DHPT position calculated over a monthly allocation. E.g. 70% of the proposed 350,000 = approx 240,000 OP, split into 6x 40,000 monthly $OP allocations. The whitelisting process will be an ongoing governance vote. This is to ensure pools of sufficient quality qualify for $OP incentives. Criteria likely to include a minimum TVL and/or over a certain age (weeks). Given 40,000 OP as monthly incentives, if priced at $1.50 per $OP equates to an additional $60,000 of incentives per month. Annualised, this would attract the below TVL at incremental APY targets: 5% APY - additional $14.2m 10% APY - additional $7.1m 15% APY - additional $4.7m Given the current dHEDGE TVL on Optimism is $4m, forecasting an appetite for 10% APY from $OP incentives would attract $7.2m - almost twice the current TVL to dHEDGE. This liquidity is likely to remain on Optimism given the unique staking model dHEDGE is about to launch. DHT rewards are paid to users staking both DHT and Pool Tokens, and the emissions model favours longer term staking durations. Additionally, we may seek to use 10% of this allocation as specific rewards for a trading competition.  Liquidity Mining (30%)  dHEDGE is currently migrating governance onto L2, and requires a deep source of liquidity for fluid management of staking rewards and acquisition of governance power. As such, we propose to incentivize a DHT:OP pool on Optimism, and allocate 30% of the proposed grant to encourage this liquidity. This program will also run for 6 months, and will be matched 1:1 with DHT tokens. Liquidity will be hosted on Velodrome/Uniswap, and managed via a dHEDGE pool. Dividing this portion of the grant distribution over 6 months would provide 17,500 $OP per month in liquidity incentives. Matched with DHT, (and pricing $OP at $1.50), would allocate approx $50k per month in total OP and DHT rewards. For a volatile pair pool, this would attract $1.2m in TVL at an APY of 50%. ",

We\u2019re happy to share some of our insights! dHedge has previously been reviewed on PrimeRating and by DeFi Safety. They received a good technical score of 76% and a decent fundamental score of 63%, resulting in a B+ overall rating (last updated June 16, 2022). dHEDGE has around $12 million in TVL. $4.29 million in Polygon, $4.2 million in Ethereum and $3.47 million in Optimism. The number of investors giving money to fund managers has experienced a positive trend in dHEDGE, especially since the compatibility with Polygon & Optimism was enabled. Although the total addressable market is not very big yet, dHEDGE demand also matches the proportion of the whole hedge fund industry on the total asset value of the world, and the demand has also shown signs of growth despite market conditions. In this sense, it appears to have achieved some sort of market fit in an industry with similar growth potential as the whole crypto market. As mentioned in the proposal dHEDGE\u2019s most direct competitor, with the most similar characteristics, is Enzyme Finance which has almost 4 times of dHedges TVL but is not compatible with Optimism yet. Nevertheless, it has the potential and capabilities to grow in the long term, as they are creating a very compelling alternative to Enzyme. With the right incentives, the chances of more users getting attracted to use dHedge on Optimism are probably high. Generally in favour of this proposal! ",

ETH or OP) + arbitrage opps (reactivation of) trading competitions & top investors builder incentives (e.g. integrate certain pools in new projects or meta investment apps)    PS: Just saw that you planned to add 100% co-incentives in your previous proposal but this time only 30% matching Op liquidity mining incentives. In our opinion, that is still a significant contribution and we prefer to see smaller projects do well & contribute to Op growth, rather than overspend on (co-)incentives. ",

For example $DHPT could describe a share in Stablecoin Yield on Optimisim (this pool however has a specific ticker $USDy)   Regarding the criteria for a pool to be whitelisted for staking rewards, a dHEDGE Feature Proposal will be posted in governance to clarify the exact criteria. The first proposal is likely to be a minimum TVL of $20k and pool age of at least 30 days, and this will be subject to a governance vote to pass.   Regarding incentivizing the OP:DHT liquidity pair, there is currently no deep source of liquidity on Optimism for the DHT token, and this will be required for efficiently operating dHEDGE governance (accruing governance power, utilisation of staking rewards). A fluid dHEDGE governance program on Optimism is important for the health of the protocol.   ",

The last few months we have been working on building out the infrastructure on the most effective and efficient way to distribute the OP for the investors in the whitelisted dHEDGE pools. Along with the process for dHEDGE Managers to apply to be whitelisted. This distribution is now ready to go and the 70% portion of the grant will begin distribution at the end of January.
