I have excluded from this update regularly scheduled interactions (e.g., off-chain collateral management meeting, weekly meeting with SES on core unit incubation,etc.).  Week of May 2nd  Develop draft detailed transaction execution schedule for HVBank HVBank alignment meeting on transaction execution schedule, transaction agreements, and agreement preparation Meeting with CES to discuss MIP21 and token mechanics for HVBank Draft detailed terms and conditions for transaction agreements for scheduled discussion with HVBank in mid May    SG Forge weekly meeting Review revised DAI Loan Agreement and Instruction Letter, draft revisions based on weekly meeting alignment, circulate to SG Forge. Most revisions finalizing and fine-tuning the mechanics.    Review Maple D3M transaction agreements and provide written comments Conference with Maple on comments to transaction agreements    Align with Centrifuge on final wording for Centrifuge draft Indenture Trust Agreement    RWF Office Hours Presentation on Taxonomy for Decision-Making for Real World Assets  Also, other than the SG Forge transaction, North Lakes Legal has not yet instructed external counsel to support the above. I do anticipate external support for the HVBank transaction and I am finalizing the engagement letter. Happy to respond to any questions. @Real-World-Finance @luca_pro ",

I understand completely. I have assumed this would be the case and there would be a learning curve for firms (not limited to RWF).

HVB  I have been nearly 100% focused on processing each of the agreements for the HVB transaction. A brief status is below:      RWA Foundation Articles of Association Drafting amendments to enshrine Maker governance in key decisions (as described in the Risk Assessment).     Escrow Agreement between RWA Foundation and WSFS Aligned with WSFS (ready for execution)   RWA Master Participation Trust Received mark-up from WSFS counsel on 6/29, discussed mark-up with WSFS counsel on 6/30 and LTS will circulate a revised draft on 7/1. No commercial issues identified, mostly mechanical revisions to \u201cautomate\u201d certain key Trustee activities - for instance, running the cash waterfall - without requiring direction from the Trust Sponsor.   RWA Participation Agreement Draft received from HVB on 6/24 and LTS provided comments on 6/27. No commercial issues identified. Again, mostly mechanical revisions.   HVB Servicing Agreement Draft received from HVB on 6/24 and LTS provided comments on 6/27. No commercial issues identified.   Ankura Trust Engagement Letter (as Calculation Agent, Crypto Servicer and Custodian) Draft received from Ankura on 6/22 and LTS provided comments on 6/30. The engagement letter required significant updates to include a detailed scope of work for Ankura as Calculation Agent, Crypto Servicer and Custodian    As noted in the updated CES Risk Assessment Here, LTS has, with RWF and CES, been actively exploring options to address counterparty risk in DAI/USD conversion. While the proposed technical solution reduces the counterparty risk, the only technique to eliminate the counterparty risk will be to have RWA Foundation deposit 25M DAI with an escrow agent and have the counterparty deposit $25M with the same escrow agent. The escrow agent would then release funds to the parties. However this solution presents two issues: (1) what escrow agent can accept both DAI and US$?; and (2) is the balance sheet of the escrow agent adequate (or better than the counterparty)? The solution simply shifts the risk from the counterparty to the escrow agent. The proposed solution to limit the size of the draws is, at present, the only viable solution to mitigate the risk. Smaller sized draws will further diminish the risk but require a greater number of executive spells. Incubating LTS has discussed the available options with a New York derivatives lawyer. SocGen   Review and provided comments to SocGen on draft Pledge Agreement   Finalize minor updates to the draft Instruction Letter   Weekly call with SocGen   ",
