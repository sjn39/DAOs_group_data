Hey folks, As you might be aware we\u2019re not hosting a formal Governance and Risk call today as people are winding down for the holiday season. However we didn\u2019t want to waste a chance for the community to come together more causally today! Join us in the #Hangout-Room Voice Chat on our Discord Server for some fun and games  If you\u2019re lucky you might catch a verse from @flipflopflapdelegate  and @prose11 . Happy holidays Maker community, hoping to see some of you in the discord at 17:00 UTC today! CC: @Recognized-Delegates @Core-Facilitators ",
