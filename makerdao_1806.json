                    "content": "Hi all, this post explains the sequential process for shutting down Single Collateral Dai. The process involves two executive spells; one to protect MCD and the other to shutdown SCD. I will outline what these steps are and why they are important. As of April the 19th you will notice that the section in (B) Executive Spell 2, now includes updated steps, a timeline and request Governance Vote support. A) Executive Spell 1 - Set the SAI Debt Ceiling to 0 in MCD  This action will protect MCD by preventing SAI from being swapped for DAI. This is necessary to prevent exposing MCD to SAI liquidity and/or peg fluctuations. We will continue to allow DAI to be swapped for SAI. This will allow individuals to push DAI through the Migration Contract to drain it of all the SAI, which will be burnt into ETH at shutdown.  SCD is now isolated from MCD, the Migration Contract has been drained, and SCD can be safely shut down\u2026 B) Executive Spell 2 - SCD Global Settlement  The action of calling cage is the final and definitive step to shutting down Single Collateral Dai.   -> New Information: Proposed SCD shutdown steps once the SAI Debt Ceiling has been set to 0: 24th April: Governance community vote on SCD Shutdown. The community has signalled to introduce a \u2018pause\u2019 which we are calling the grace period between when this vote passes and the time at which SCD is actually shutdown. This gives the community time to carry out the following steps. 24th April: MKR Oracle is deactivated. Following community approval of the Governance poll (link tbd 20th April), The Oracle Team with their existing mandate will deactivate the individual price feed providers thereby invalidating the MKR price feed. This will have the effect of eliminating the MKR stability fees for all remaining CDPs (more information below). 24th April - 10th May: CDP holders migrate to MCD. This will be possible through the Migration Portal and will not require the payment of stability fees. This will have the positive effect of encouraging people to (1) migrate their CDPs and (2) help reduce the amount of Sai in the migration contract. 10th/11th May: Liquidity providers drain the migration contract. Liquidity providers will work with the Foundation to drain the migration contract, which will involve:  Depositing USDC into MCD to mint enough DAI to cover the remaining balance of SAI in the migration contract This DAI will be converted into SAI which will be deposited into the migration contract The migration contract at 0 will now be unable to introduce unbacked debt into MCD once shutdown occurs  12th May: Actual SCD shutdown occurs. As planned in the SCD shutdown spell, the end of the grace period marks actual SCD shutdown, this is currently scheduled for the 12th of May. Upon which point, SCD will be irreversibly shutdown and one SAI will become fixed to $1 of ETH. Timeline:  SCD Shutdown Steps1069\u00d7473 36.5 KB  Supporting Notes: Governance Poll Support for Oracle Deactivation Vote Here By deactivating the MKR Oracle for SCD in order to forgive Stability Fees, it will be necessary to post an active Governance Poll requesting Maker Community support. As can be seen from the above process, the action of deactivating the Oracle will eliminate stability fees and incentivize users to migrate their CDPs. This process helps the community of CDP holders work together to drain the migration contract. The end state for CDP holders migrating is no different than if they had waited for actual shutdown, yet it has the benefit of allowing instant migration, and no need to wait for actual shutdown with the ensuing cool down period (6hrs). It also reduces the burden and exposure of liquidity providers needing to source large amounts of Sai for the migration contract. Implications: There is a risk that unknown ecosystem participants may be using the MKR Oracle feed, in which case deactivating it would disrupt their feed ingestion. We will be doing a blockchain block analysis of who is using the feed as well as reaching out to partners to mitigate this risk as much as possible. SAI Liquidity Providers: In the above, you may have noticed that liquidity providers will be depositing USDC to mint DAI which will be converted into SAI to drain the migration contract. Once shutdown occurs they will be left holding anywhere up to 20k ETH depending on the amount of SAI they needed to purchase. To complete the trade and eliminate exposure on the original USDC position, this ETH will incrementally be wound back into DAI and the original USDC position closed.  SCD has now been globally settled and Sai owners (including the liquidity providers that purchased SAI) can claim their ETH collateral while CDP holders must wait for the cool down period to end\u2026 C) Sai Owners Redeem Collateral While Bite Keepers Bite CDPs  Sai owners will be able to immediately redeem their ETH collateral from the Migration App. (Draft UI to be shared in a follow-up post) Bite keepers will be required to bite all CDPs to ensure that the maximum PETH:WETH ratio has been reached before CDP holders claim their collateral. The Migration App will not allow CDP collateral redemption before this time has elapsed. (Please see note below)  Now that the bite keepers have bitten all CDPs and a maximum amount of ETH can be claimed for each unit of PETH that a CDP holds, the CDP holder can now claim their collateral\u2026 D) CDP Holders Redeem Collateral  CDP holders can go to the Migration App to redeem their ETH. (Draft UI to be share in follow-up post)  The End - Success! Note: PETH:WETH Ratio - This will be covered in our shutdown guide, however I would like to give it mention here too. Please observe the cool down period before redeeming your collateral - this is currently estimated to be 6hrs yet may be much longer, and will be determined at the time of shutdown as a result of how many outstanding CDPs exist. This waiting period is necessary in order for the system debt to be accounted for by bite keepers, thereby allowing users to receive a maximum amount of WETH for every unit of PETH in their CDP. If they do not wait, the exchange rate may not yet be favourable due to debt in the system. Although the Migrate.makerdao.com site will not allow users to claim their collateral during this cool down period, interacting through the command line will still be possible, so again, users should pay close attention to the PETH:WETH exchange rate applied. Immediate Next Steps A) The Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team and the Interim Oracle Team have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system for the community to signal their support for the Oracle team to deactivate the MKR Oracle in Single Collateral Dai.

                    "content": "I think a couple points here. Precursor to step A not mentioned is that SCD DC should go from $20M to $15M.   Then Step A)  Setting SAI DC to 0 to MCD.  Realize by nature of both these actions this will begin a liquidity crunch on SAI to drive the PEG up.   Literally there will be nothing we can do about this.    The question will then be how far does the community allow the PEG to move before we execute step B. The other issue here is that the DAI/SAI in migration contract will have to undergo settlement.  SAI exchanged for ETH and ETH sold for DAI to cover the migration contract DAI.   I honestly would like to have an idea on hand before we do Step A) on who is going to take this on or how the community is going to deal with it?   We don\u2019t want to be figuring this part out before we do step A) Another point I DO NOT like the idea that people can in step C) claiming collateral using command line tools.  This seems to create a disconnect in terms of access.   Now if this means people will end up losing if they access early ok, fine, but if they gain advantage we need to mitigate this imo.   Probably someone will have to watch on-chain tx\u2019s to determine if we need to move faster on opening up redemptions to all step D).  I think this means we need to do this in a rising vs. falling market.  We need all auctions cleared which again is why we should not allow people to open new CDPs here.  (see precursor to step A) SCD DC from 20M to 15M. Regarding fees and incentives to take on the migration contract DAI.  I heard that governance can change the GS OSM price on ETH and mint SAI.   Wouldn\u2019t the way to apply a tax across the board is to change the OSM price down by the tax% and mint corresponding SAI in effect diluting SAI or is there some mechanism for only allowing 1-tax% to be the SAI value for redemptions against collateral? My point here is that using something like above tools might be the final move (even if talking about how to do this) to get people out of CDPs.  We could then open up a deposit facility for people than want to deposit SAI to drain DAI from the migration contract for a piece of the fee from the above move. I am just thinking out loud here to try to kill multiple problems with one set of actions.  Not for Maker to collect fees (which would be nice) but for how to extract them from the system to deal with the lagging issues and use the funds to incentivize actors to take on the migration contract risk by depositing SAI in another contract so this can all be tracked\u2026 Anyway I am back to my precursor to step A)   SCD DC from 20M-15M as the first step. One last thing Derek. Thank you for putting this all together! Having steps helps a lot and I really wished I understood the PETH/WETH equations better because I like the idea of collecting fees but then distributing them to incentivize actors to close out things and use them to buffer unforseen \u2018expenses\u2019 that may appear here.  Anything left over we can give back to CDP holders or just use to burn MKR as the fee for everything\u2026  Heck we could use the ETH as the beginning of a fund to compensate people for Black Thursday so perhaps this SAI in the migraction contract might find some real use after all.

Similarly, yes, we need better clarity on who will help drain the migration contract.   If an individual chooses to redeem collateral via a CLI there is no negative impact to people who are only redeeming via the UI. If there is still debt in the system, then the first person redeeming would be at a disadvantage because their unit of PETH would be worth less ETH until system debt that impacts that exchange rate has been cleared.   It\u2019s probably not a good precedent for Governance to set any Oracle price other than the price at the time of shutdown. I need to ponder this some more, but essentially you\u2019re saying to create an arbitrage opportunity for DAI holders to purchase SAI.   ",

These have included; working with liquidity providers, exploring protocol changes as well as working with existing CDP and Vault holders. In this post, which I have appended to the opening post under B) Executive Spell 2, I will propose a solution through a set of steps; including deactivating the SCD MKR Oracle, implementing a grace period for people to migrate, and sourcing DAI to drain the migration contract in time to shutdown SCD. As detailed above, the next steps involve the Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team and the Interim Oracle Team placing a Governance Poll into the voting system on Monday 20th April, for the community to signal their support for the Oracle team to deactivate the MKR Oracle in Single Collateral Dai.

On shutdown all stability fees are forgiven but again be cautious to maintain collateralization as per usual. Because the system is now approaching shutdown there is no more migrating to MCD, meaning that users will be able to claim their ETH. The reason for not being able to use the migration contract as intended was that over the weekend one of the large CDP holders migrated their CDP and drained the migration contract, which means that it is no longer possible to migrate using that mechanism. Therefore we must wait until the 12th which is the date determined by the community. ",

Now, if you happen to have too much Sai debt that makes it difficult to source and pay off, then the only option is to wait until the 12th. So, if it isn\u2019t too expensive to source the Sai today then it would be ideal to close your CDP and get your ETH so you don\u2019t have to wait for the cooldown period. But, if you can\u2019t do that, then, as above, you will have to wait for the 12th. On May the 12th it will not be automatic, you will have to go to the migration portal as described in this forum post ",

Both options are lethal for the CDP holders because  option 1)  can lead them to face huge potential market risk (if ETH price drops to an unacceptable level, they still need to (get forced) sell their ETHs from the contract collateral at shutdown), on top of potential getting liquidated (if ETH price crashes again) even before the shutdown. And  option 2)  forces the already financially wounded CDP holders to obtain SAI now with insanely markups (based on current market condition). B  \u2014 In addition to the risks mentioned above, is the timing of the shutdown. It is scheduled (voted) for  16:00 UTC on May 12th  , and this is just about  3 hours after the Bitcoin Halving  (as expected now). Can\u2019t even tell if this timing is just being coincident or plotted. Regardless, this just adds extra risks to the community as people have been discussing about potential market crash right after the halving (though no one really knows the truth until that time, but why gamble with the loyal CDP holder\u2019s valuable asset?). Plus, the final settlement price will be just based on one snap shot at 16:00 UTC on May 12th, and it will provide an easier way for whales to manipulate the market for their own gains (if they want to). This has nothing to do with the robustness of the pricing oracle, because the pricing period is just too short, and too risky for CDP holders (and SAI owners as well). You don\u2019t need to be a finance expert to understand this. C  \u2014 Due to many previous CDP liquidating incidences, there are already rumours flying around that the MakerDAO team has been associated with whales to \u201cslaughter\u201d the CDP owners, who are the loyal and long term supporters of this project. And I don\u2019t think it is true at all, can be just a perception. This will further damage the MakerDAO reputation for sure. Not even mentioning about the extra stress adding to people on top the current Coronavirus situation that we are all facing now. D  \u2014 With all of the above concerns, I sincerely hope that the MakerDAO team will reconsider the followings to mitigate all of the potentials risks:  Work with SAI liquidity providers to add more SAIs back to the Migration Contract to help CDP holders to make a more smooth and less risk migration to MCD Vaults. If impossible to accomplish item 1) above, then at least to work with SAI liquidity providers to provide a  more fair SAI markets  for CDP owners to obtain SAI to close their CDPs properly before shutdown, but not to take advantage of the poor long term supporters. Adjust the final shutdown date/time to avoid the potential market turbulence (3 hours after Bitcoin Halving), maybe one day before or a week later can be better. Expand the shutdown final settlement pricing period. A 48-hour or 24-hour average price will be ideal, but just a snap shot at 16:00 UTC will impose huge market risk as mentioned in \u201c paragraph B \u201d above.  We understand that the team has been dealing with lots of stresses from different parts of this project on the top of the health crisis that we are all facing around the world now. I believe that you can do all of the 4 items stated in  paragraph D  above, and manage to help the community to make a smooth transition. Let\u2019s do something before it is too late. And I thank you all for your hard works and contributions to the crypto community!! Stay safe and well.  THANK YOU!! ",
