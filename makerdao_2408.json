We\u2019re now in the tricky position that we can\u2019t set risk premium values without simultaneously lowering the base rate if we want to keep stability fees approximately equal to what they are now. It would require clear communication that would likely be overlooked by many not paying attention. An alternative solution is to Signal and agree upon Risk Premium values (guided by Cyrus and the risk team). Then have them ready to implent on chain once the peg starts dropping. Maybe I\u2019m not giving enough credit to the DAO to be able to vote in Risk Premiums and also know to drop the Base Rate to negative at the same time. ",
