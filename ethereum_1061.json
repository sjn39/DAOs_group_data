Better than eradicating this revenue or expending resources to identify and quantify it generally (which may be impossible).  Recent research shows that the revenue that can be extracted from this (called \u201cminer- extractable value \u201d or MEV) is potentially significantly higher than transaction fee revenue.

Special thanks to Vitalik for much of this, Phil Daian as well (& his amazing research on MEV), Barry Whitehat for also coming up with this idea, and Ben Jones for the rest!

The post also mentions recent research on MEV and gives credit to individuals who contributed to the idea. A 3rd party gives constructive criticism by suggesting that the proposal may not be feasible due to the potential for MEV to create a monopoly. Another 3rd party extends to the proposal by suggesting that it could be a solution to the current issues with block rewards. Finally, a 3rd party asks a question about the post.",
