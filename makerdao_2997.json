Oracle Data Model A smart contract utilizing Uniswap primitives and liquidity reserves to calculate the price of a Uniswap Liquidity Provider (LP) token. The reserves of the Uniswap pool, and the supply of the Uniswap LP token are used as inputs to the model. This model utilizes MakerDAO Oracles to price the underlying assets. This model utilizes the following base assumptions: (1) Invariant k = reserve_x * reserve_y (2) reserve_x * price_x = reserve_y * price_y (only holds true at steady-state) Combining (1) and (2) allows us to derive the formulas for calculating the \u201cnormalized\u201d reserve balances of the underlying assets given the invariant k and prices of the underlying assets. (3) reserve_x = sqrt(k * price_y / price_x) (4) reserve_y = sqrt*(k  * price_x / price_y) Alternatively given one calculated normalized reserve, one can calculate the other using a mutation of (1). This is useful for optimizing gas since calculating the square root is an expensive operation. (5) reserve_x = k / reserve_y (6) reserve_y = k / reserve_x Once the normalized reserve balances have been calculated the price of the LP token can be derived: (7) price_lp = ( (reserve_x * price_x) + (reserve_y * price_y) ) / supply_lp Substitute of (3), (4) and (7) gives us the following model for calculating the price of a Uniswap V2 LP token: (8) price_lp = ( (sqrt(k * price_y / price_x) * price_x) + (sqrt(k * price_x / price_y) * price_y) ) / supply_lp Oracle Supporting Data Model(s) ETH/USD (canonical) |    Source     |  Asset Pair   |  Feed Model  | | :------------ | :------------ | :----------: |  |   Binance     |    ETH/USD    |    Median    | |   Bitfinex    |    ETH/USDT   |              | |   Bitstamp    |    ETH/USD    |              | |   Coinbase    |    ETH/USD    |              | |   Gemini      |    ETH/USD    |              | |   Kraken      |    ETH/USD    |              |  DAI/USD (canonical) |    Source     |  Asset Pair   |  Feed Model  | | :------------ | :------------ | :----------: |  |      1        |    DAI/USD    |   constant   |  Oracle Address  Mainnet - UniV2LpOracle - TBD  Supported Tools UniV2LpOracle - Source Code UniV2LpOracle - Tests Remaining Work  Finish internal reviews of smart contract code.  Currently pending incomplete PR on formatting branch   Update MegaPoker to poke UniV2LpOracle  Summary This is a bespoke Oracle smart contract for determining the price of a Uniswap V2 LP token. This same contract can be used to generate an Uniswap LP Token Oracle for any Uniswap V2 pair so long as Maker Oracles are provided for the underlying assets in the pool. Deploying any new smart-contract code into production always comes with risk. As we\u2019ve seen with the majority of DeFi exploits over the past year, Oracles are often heavily targeted. Deploying new Oracle smart contracts into production needs to be approached with an abundance of caution. At the same time, the potential of LP tokens to generate Dai is significant given that they enable Uniswap Liquidity Providers to leverage LP rewards. Therefore the Oracle Domain Team is recommending that we onboard Uniswap LP tokens as collateral using these new Oracle smart contract with the condition that we severely limit the debt ceiling initially. Over time as the community\u2019s confidence in the new contract grows the debt ceiling can be steadily increased. Getting an audit of the code would be highly desirable, with the understanding that any green light from an audit would not include the underlying Uniswap Protocol in scope. The decision on debt ceiling is ultimately up to the Risk Domain Team, but the Oracle Domain Team is recommending an initial debt ceiling of 3M Dai given the enhanced Oracle risk. ",

Liquidations are not conducted through the Maker Protocol\u2019s liquidation mechanism but instead conducted off-chain through a trust. The trust is legally bound with a set of conditions for liquidation, one of which is a signal from Maker Governance to liquidate. Hence from a liquidations perspective, there is no need for an Oracle updated by Feeds to broadcast the price of RWA-001. Instead, liquidation require an Oracle containing a boolean toggle controlled by Maker Governance. Typically in the Maker Protocol, the price an Oracle exhibits in combination with the collateralization ratio is used to determine the maximum amount of Dai that can be generated against a specific collateral. RWA-001 is handled differently as the value of the tokenized representation of equity and the credit line extended to that equity is ratified by Maker Governance before the collateral is onboarded into the Maker Protocol. Hence from a Dai generation perspective, there is no need for an Oracle broadcasting the price of RWA-001. As we have shown the price of RWA-001 tokenized representation of equity is not utilized in the Maker Protocol in any fashion, neither in liquidations nor in determining the amount of Dai that can be generated. Instead, the role of an Oracle for RWA-001 as described in the current implementation of MIP21 is exclusively as a liquidation signaling mechanism for Maker Governance. Due to the complexity of integrating a real world asset into the Maker Protocol, the Oracle Domain Team believes the configuration of legal and technical structures described in MIP21 are a good baseline to build on. That said, The Oracle Domain Team highly urges the MakerDAO community to iterate on the processes described in MIP21 and governing RWA-001 and future real world assets, such that more guaranteed are ensured cryptographically by the Maker Protocol rather than complex legal arrangements. One such area might be the periodic assessment of the value of the underlying equity by a neutral third party such that the MakerDAO community has a clear view of the present-value to inform their prerogative to liquidate.

Maybe I\u2019m missing some important forum in this regard (if so please if possible point me to it). I imagine that we could keep a part of the earnings from the RWA earned interest to ensure on-chain kept valuation of the asset in a monthly basis by any trusted 3rd party (this would be an on-chain number in the oracle only possible to be modified by the approved 3rd parties, more than N needed to ensure greater security). And I guess that the Trust will earn the liquidation fee when the assets are liquidated? or part of it? I\u2019ll keep looking for some answers to these, maybe they have been handled in other thread.
