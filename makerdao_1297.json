Using a SR and changing the process now would be inappropriate considering that 1) a SR is not sybil resistant, 2) that process has not been ratified, 3) the goal of that process is to stop spam. This proposal is clearly not spam based on the discussion in this thread. We cannot just change governance process willy nilly because one person puts a proposal forward. Using signal requests broadly is problematic because it gate-keeps MKR holder votes. This is already a noted problem. There needs to be a way to stop spam and not gatekeep MKR holder will. Signal requests do not achieve this. It puts the court of opinion ahead of MKR holder will. Any proposed process that does this is unlikely to be approved. ",
