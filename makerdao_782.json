Our conversations lead us to believe that Jon also understand the concept of decentralization and the importance of marketing MakerDAO as the premier protocol of DeFi. He is open-minded and we believe he will welcome any advice that you as a community member believe will help MakerDAO stay marketable and innovative. However, I don\u2019t believe we expanded on @PonJerry ability to book Talent needed to showcase an event\u2013Jon can you please expand on that? Also, would it be possible to monetize Events sometime down the road? We see folks like Solana charging $380 per person for their next nightclub event in Miami this coming April. ",

So just to clear things up @PonJerry  will be taking on the governance roll for the events team. Yes we are both named John/Jon which is comically confusing to say the least. I\u2019ll go by Legg (my last name) to save everyone the hassle. I\u2019ll let @PonJerry introduce himself to you all and talk you through his roll with the events team. As far as monetizing the Maker events, this is absolutely possible in the future. I believe that given a few more professionally executed events coordinated with my team, Maker events will cement itself as \u201cTHE Go-to event\u201d. This will bring huge monetizing potential which will then lower our overall budget. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for your support @flipflopflapdelegate.  As @Leggevents mentioned there are two of us to confuse everyone.  We did briefly meet at ETH Denver but the more extensive conversations you had were with Legg. @Leggevents did a fantastic job putting DAIvinity together and communicating with the Maker team to pull everything together. I was equally involved but more in the background handling the technical aspects of the event, so less known to most people at the moment. Let us also touch on @Leggevents ability to book and curate talent as credit is due on this aspect.  Legg managed to create and execute an event under an extremely short timeline.  He was able to leverage his connections to bring together an all-star crew that contained expertise in visual animation, LED lighting and branding.  The international artist also curated were fantastic and you could see the positive reaction of the attendees. Moving forward as a CU we have determined the best structure is for me to be the facilitator for two reasons.  The first is my background is better suited to navigate the governance side and financial/budget aspects of the CU.  The second is 2-3weeks leading up to events the workload of the event manager is extensive and could create conflict between the immediate needs of the event and any governance work.  Having myself as the facilitator allows @Leggevents to have full focus on the upcoming event while in parallel I can handle anything required on the governance and community side. The proposal for monetizing events is a great suggestion and something that can be implemented in the future.  After a series of free events to get the Maker name established transitioning to a hybrid of free and monetized is a good direction.  This could allow the CU to generate an income to offset the financial burden on the DAO.  I would be interested to hear/see what a $380 Solana is like.  If you are going to the event or know anyone going please take some pics and some videos! ",
