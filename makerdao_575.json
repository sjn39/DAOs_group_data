Maybe @0xdeniz has more insights on that. ",

Through collaborating with the TechOps team we found that the API was unavailable due to the high number of complex queries that were posted to it yesterday (due to high traffic and lots of liquidations happening). TechOps was able to quickly upgrade the server that hosts the service, which resolved the issue. Even though we are not explicitly responsible for the Liquidations Portal we defined some potential improvements that would decrease the load on such APIs\u2014we\u2019ll look into how to get those implemented. These UIs lack explicit ownership currently so we\u2019re happy that SAS was onboarded recently to cover these grounds. ",
