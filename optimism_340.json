Growth Experiments Sub-Committee Project description: Data Unions are an ethical new way of monetizing data. It enables organizations to empower their users to earn tokens by sharing data. The Data Union smart contracts are a blueprint for creating new \u201cx to earn\u201d business models for the real world. Our SCs are audited and optimized for micropayments to millions of users and currently deployed on Polygon and Gnosis Chain. We provide an easy solution to broadcast revenue to large groups of users simultaneously. Data is streamed and stored via the Streamr Network. Members (users) of a Data Union (organization) do not need any web3 knowledge to use a DU\u2019s application - a self-sovereign wallet is created for every new user that joins a Data Union helping organizations to onboard new mainstream users into crypto. The Data Union DAO\u2019s smart contracts and SDK have been worked on by Streamr since 2019. The Data Union DAO (DU DAO) is a spin-off from Streamr closely working with the Streamr DAO to grow the Data Union ecosystem and to develop the tech further.

Yes, it is open source. Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: H1 (aim for Q1) 2023 Ecosystem Value Proposition: What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? The Optimism collective wants to expand beyond the digital realm and into the physical world. (optimism.io/vision). The internet as we know it today runs on selling people\u2019s data, but we as the end users of internet applications do not earn any share in the revenue that our data is creating. A suite of tools is needed on Optimism to cross the chasm between the benefits that Optimism provides and applications that run in the physical world that give monetary value from data sales back to the users. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? The Data Union smart contracts have a proven track record of providing the infrastructure required for building applications that connect end users with real-world applications (the most notable one is DIMO https://dimo.zone/). The Data Union smart contract enables fair revenue sharing from the value that the users\u2019 data creates. Our developer-friendly SCs & SDK enable builders to easily deploy a Data Union and create incentive mechanisms via micropayments - which scale to millions of users - to grow their project\u2019s userbase which increases the value of their data sets. The grant will cover Data Union DAO to deploy on Optimism, and participate in an ETH Global hackathon to build a new Data Union on Optimism. Half of the grant will be offered as OP incentives that will help fund developers to prioritize building and deploying on Optimism above other L2s. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? Our Data Unions tech will drive growth in (mainstream) users and transactions on Optimism and offer a blueprint for builders to disrupt and innovate existing data business models. The infrastructure provided by the Data Union DAO has created over 500k transactions on Gnosis Chain. We are looking at bringing the smart contracts to multiple blockchains to (1) increase the benefit of the SCs for multiple blockchain ecosystems and (2) reach more developer communities. The DU tech provides a source of growth in the numbers of mainstream users, it can be seen as an acquisition channel where a mainstream user earns their first crypto using a Data Union application, and by doing so learn that they have earned their tokens on Optimism. Data Unions offer an \u201cx to earn\u201d blueprint for creating new business models that create incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing data, where data sets are monetized and the monetary value is shared with every user that participated. So far three startups using our tech (Swash, DIMO, Unbanx) raised a total of $30m. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant? No Number of OP tokens requested: 250,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No but we would like an introduction to chat about a long-term partnership. If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: NA How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): 50% of the grant (125,000 OP) will be used as incentives for builders to deploy and build their Data Union on Optimism. Co-incentives are subject to the fundraising of Data Union DAO. Proposal for token distribution: How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.) 50% - incentives for devs to build a Data Union on Optimism 50% - deployment on Optimism and to cover hackathon operational expenses Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals. Timeline in weeks 3-4 weeks deployment, testing and launch preparations. 3-4 weeks after launch: first Hackathon. Ad-hoc, OP incentives are issued out ad-hoc on project based milestones, growth & needs. Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable. Grant Distribution: 40% upfront and 60% after completing milestone 2. Milestones: M1: Deployment on Optimism. M2: Sponsorship of a hackathon, with a prize to launch a DU on Optimism. M3: Help teams from hackathon to build and validate their business models and product-market fit. M4: Hackathon DU onboards 5k (mainstream) users to Optimism and crosses 5k transactions. M5: Help teams get off the ground with their project so that they can continue developing their DU project on Optimism without having to rely on funding from DU DAO. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? The OP incentives should get the teams to a point where they are able to put their own incentives into place and maintain and grow their userbase. After the OP incentives are dried up the Data Union that issued the incentives is responsible for making sure that the users are continued in being rewarded for the users data - this is usually in the form of the DU projects own native token but could also be provided by the DU DAO in form of the $DATA or $UNION token, in case the Data Union has not yet launched their own token (an example is Swash). Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) Gnosis DataUnionFactory: 0x82F1b8a9521933ecC41A9062f1eb597D0Ad6e12F DataUnionTemplate: 0xA7E64C07464DdC69dC1534C14c7c724E5807d42a Polygon DataUnionFactory: 0x3dBDf6C439FC2C90F98C351c90682A7cCe3366E5 DataUnionTemplate: 0x6D73eDf9366c97ed12C78C41F02A9254e9184CB1 ",

Here are the changes we have made so far:  We reduced our OP ask from 269,420 OP to 250,000 to be aligned with the latest builders grants criteria. We added the payout percentages and linked them to certain internal milestones. We specified which type of hackathon we will be sponsoring (community feedback by @NicoEsp ).

                    "content": "hi @diomedas congrats on being elected by the OP FND as lead, its very exciting to see someone from the Alliance accelerator join OP, especially since Alliance is aligned with our thesis of \u201cx to earn\u201d and the innovations happening by utilizing token incentives and infrastructure networks. I am also sure you or your team are following the developments in this space, as mentioned in the proposal we call DIMO a Data Union, but it seems like DIMO could very well be much better suited for the DePIN category (Messari\u2019s new theses for trends to watch out for in 2023). Edit: That being said, it is quite frustrating to not see Streamr in the CDN Networks category on the DePIN sector map, they have been actively shaping this sector and are also one of the reasons why DIMO came to existence in the first place.

While we are open to governance revisiting this prohibition, while it is still in place, Governance Fund grants can\u2019t be used to offset expenses directly by selling.  Screen Shot 2023-02-01 at 6.19.11 AM1452\u00d7486 196 KB  We recommend clarifying that this will not be the case, or revising the grant application to exclude activities that require direct funding through selling OP.
