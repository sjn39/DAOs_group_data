                    "content": "Hey folks, Raf CEO of TrustToken here. We\u2019re excited to see TUSD integrated as DAI collateral and are here to address the concerns that arose in the discussion below.     TUSD Update (Forum Poll): Concerns Surrounding the TUSD Collateral Type Governance       Voting \u201cset TUSD debt ceiling to 0\u201d because I think MakerDAO should seek a high level of stability from collateral ERC20 contract implementations.  The kind of change TUSD experienced should be seen as similar to migrating from a current token to a new one, except that the new and old version won\u2019t work in parallel.  When the likelihood of migration to a new implementation is high, the value of adding the current version is relatively low.     We understand your concerns and want to work together to address them. We believe onboarding TUSD as collateral for DAI is mutually beneficial, and we can commit to changes or compromises to make this integration secure, easy, and reliable. Where additional collateral types help keep DAI stable, the addition of TUSD, a 1:1 dollar-backed, live-attested stablecoin, would allow users to borrow DAI using TUSD and keep DAI\u2019s value closer to $1. In addition, there is a high supply of TUSD available to borrow in protocols such as Aave, which users could use to mint DAI. Responding to Points in \u201cTUSD Update: Concerns surrounding the TUSD Collateral Type\u201d Concern 1: Deposit Address The only way for a deposit address to be registered is through our Deposit Address Registrar. The adapter will never be marked as a deposit address, since the only key that writes deposit addresses is the Autosweep Registrar. We never manually declare addresses as deposit addresses. Additionally, note that for any of the fiat-backed stablecoins, if their private keys were to be fully compromised, the attacker could upgrade the contract arbitrarily and cause arbitrary behavior. The best defense, under current best practices, is to use a multisig. Concern 2: Private Keys Currently, the ability to upgrade the TrueUSD implementation is governed by a multisig located at 0x285d362e41ccc116192a17d21a87f41fc26d32f9. We are working on doing the same for the registry key. To mitigate the risk of a single point of failure, we are working on moving all of our important keys to a multisig setup. If you examine our competitors\u2019 proxies, you\u2019ll see that they are often more opaque than ours and/or have a single key, instead of a multisig, that can unilaterally upgrade the implemetation. Concern 3: Freezing Funds A blacklist function is critical to TrustToken\u2019s regulatory & legal compliance. Every compliant stablecoin will have such a feature, easily discoverable in the smart contracts of two existing DAI collateral types. In 2020 alone, USDC froze $100k by law enforcement request, and Tether froze 40 addresses containing millions of dollars in aggregate. TrustToken has a strong terms of service which prevent the arbitrary freezing of funds. Concern 4: Upgradeability/Diminishing Returns TrueUSD has gone through several audits and we are fully confident in the security of our contracts. If it is necessary to help onboard TUSD to Maker, we can go through a simplification process for our contracts to implement a more standard pattern for our token. How TrustToken Can Adapt to Maker\u2019s Concerns In order to help address the Maker community\u2019s concerns, we\u2019re willing to offer the following: Technical Change: Simplifying Code Reviews  Pre-scheduling code reviews: We are willing to commit to give Maker 14 days to review any new implementations, plus time for a vote before we make any future upgrades. Simplifying TUSD Code: It may be possible to simplify the TUSD contract by removing extraneous features (i.e. AutoSweep) and moving TrueRewards to a separate smart contract. We could agree on a maximum TUSD code size that the Maker community feels comfortable with, for example 800 LOC. Rollback: If necessary, we can downgrade the TUSD smart contract to the previous implementation, as originally approved by Maker.  Supporting Maker: Stabilizing DAI Peg with TUSD  Market making DAI: If TUSD is added as a collateral to Maker, TrustToken is able to commit $1mm TUSD as collateral to borrow DAI and sell into the market to help steady the DAI peg.  In summary, we take your concerns seriously and we\u2019re prepared to act on them to help TUSD improve the stability, reliability, and transparency of DAI. Let me conclude by asking: Would the technical changes described here make the maker community comfortable with TUSD as collateral? If so, we\u2019ll proceed with them. If not, please let us know what we\u2019d need to do to make the community comfortable with TUSD as collateral. ",

What would you think of creating a poll to see if the community has similar sentiment to what you\u2019ve voiced here? I don\u2019t think I have forum privileges to create a poll or I would. For TGBP, TCAD, THKD, and TAUD, If you\u2019d be open to it, we\u2019d love to work together to onboard those as well. These foreign currencies may actually add more value to DAI because they are fairly stable but less-correlated assets. For each of these products, if it\u2019s onboarded, we could similarly commit several hundred thousand dollars worth of each to borrow DAI and sell into the market to help further stabilize DAI price. Ultimately, a core part of our project is connecting real-world assets to the blockchain in a trustworthy, real-time-audited way, and I think our projects are actually natural partners. Down the road, you could even let us know what additional currencies or assets you\u2019d like to have as collateral and we could work together on them. Let me know what you think. ",

There are ways we could help if vaults containing TrueCurrencies (TGBP, TAUD, etc.) need to be liquidated, either by having capital ready-to-go for this purpose, or, alternatively, by providing liquidity to the TrueCurrency \u2194\ufe0f DAI or TrueCurrency \u2194\ufe0f TUSD \u2194\ufe0f DAI Uniswap pools. On-chain liquidity would make it easy for other bots to perform the liquidation themselves.

I want to start off by saying that that TrustToken team was very helpful during the process of evaluating the current implementation of TUSD, and it was a pleasure working with them. Regarding your response, we think that everything that you have proposed sounds great. Removing the complexity of the AutoSweep and TrueRewards features to external contracts (and perhaps the GasRefundToken functionality as well) would greatly improve the smart contracts team\u2019s ability to confidently review TUSD and approve it to be used as collateral within the Maker protocol. Also, it would be really helpful if going forward, updates to TUSD would add to existing functionality and not affect any existing core functionality. In addition, the pre-scheduled code reviews would allow enough time for the smart contracts team to review an implementation and allow it in the adapter before it is updated in the proxy, preventing the freezing of users funds. Going forward, we are planning on going ahead with the current governance cycle\u2019s voting regarding the current implementation of TUSD. However we look forward to seeing the simplified version of the contracts, and will be happy to do another review of them then. ",
