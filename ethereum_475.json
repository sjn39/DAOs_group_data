This is mainly so people can decide between different tracks and roughly have some idea about the content.  Wallet distribution: e,g, how do we get less reliant on google and apple here. Discuss alternatives to them like f-droid. Also think about the future - decentralized distribution systems anyone? Reproducible builds? Wallet reputation staking on standards? E.g. we agreed last year at DevCon3 on EIP681 and a lot of wallets did not yet implement it - which causes a lot of trouble. So one idea would be that projects could stake reputation on standards and it gets slashed when they do not implement it in the agreed timeframe. This reputation could then be used in the decentralized distribution systems mentioned above. Storage of private keys (currently extremely excited about the status.im hardware wallet: https://github.com/walleth/khardwarewallet ) WalletConnect - how to push it forward and get more adoption (on wallet and application side) - Versioning/Upgrade paths/backward compatibility How to decentralize more (light client incentive layer like VipNode, ultra light clients, minimal verification clients like INCUBED) - other ideas? Classification mETHadata making wallets accessible on low end devices (e.g. nokia one) for the emerging world. Also how to make wallets work in bad network conditions Wallet (interoperability) comparison matrix  Meta:  mission statement - suggestion: \u201cMake wallets more useful, interoperable, user friendly, private, decentralized, secure, accessible.\u201d SubRings?: mobile/desktop/hardware?

USB not an easy way through card reader Android support only (iOS is blocked because of limited NFC support) Status has a Java library already Public Repo: https://github.com/status-im/hardware-wallet  Discussed the challenges of backing up cards Biometrics for PIN auth? Ideally would be a good 2nd factor auth. Could be added optionally BIP 44 for different set of keys for whisper / other identity scenarios (for ex.
