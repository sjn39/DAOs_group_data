                    "content": "Hey guys nice to meet you, first thread here! I\u2019m Seraph from the Solidly team, we\u2019re an iteration of Solidly V1 inspired forks such as Velodrome or Equalizer but we\u2019re deployed on mainnet with some distinct differences. We just launched a few days ago! We\u2019re officially partnered with Yearn, Frax, Liquity, Abracadabra, Iron Bank, Ren Protocol, Deus Finance, Tarot, Beefy Finance with a few more in the pipeline. As the title suggests I was wondering if Optimism has plans to have any OP/WETH or OP/USDC liquidity over on Ethereum mainnet. I see some benefits to having it, such as:  Crosschain volume increase through arbitrage \u2192 OP bridge services benefit More exposure and user acquisition as many people are still only using Ethereum and don\u2019t even know what a L2 is  It may seem counter-intuitive at first thought but I think overall this benefits the ecosystem by removing entry-barriers and making it easier for users to discover the OP ecosystem and becoming vested in it. If there\u2019s any interest in this, I\u2019d love to have a more in-depth brain-storming session with the relevant OP team about the details (or here if you wish). We think Solidly would serve perfectly as a liquidity hub for the $OP token on mainnet, increasing user acquisition and other crosschain KPIs. No grant would be required to achieve this. Kind Regards, Seraph ",
