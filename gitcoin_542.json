For humans is important to stay together when we can\u2019t - meet in metaverse when in person is not possible. The idea to host unconference sessions is to meet stewards & friends and have non formal chat together, share memes, share whatever we want. The outcome should be built relationships as the DAO moves faster when people know each other and create more friendly atmosphere in DAO. Time: Once a month on Wednesday evening probably every second Wednesday in month ? Platform: Zoom or Gather.town Ideas and suggestions for time of this chat welcomed This idea was mentioned on Stewards call #3 I will post link with joining details later Edit: The first unconference session will happen on Wednesday August 18th at 6pm UTC Zoom link Drop your email address bellow (or DM me) if you want to get google calendar invite. This call will be added to GitcoinDAO events ",
