Selecting the area of interest should be a step in the delegation process. So the delegation process for the user (delegator) is in 3 steps:   Selection of the area (or areas) of interest. (so that the user is recommended delegates representing the selected area of interest). Select a delegate.  Delegation. Arguments for: No one reads the commitments of all delegates for selecting a delegate, most choose one of the first delegates on the list. And nobody uses filters, they don\u2019t attract much attention. And if the user can choose their area of interest then it will be easier for them to understand which delegates can represent their interests and choose one. As a result we will have diversification of voting power and more decentralization. To see that there are people with different interests in the Optimism Ecosystem, you can analyze the Optimistic Explorer stats, in which 150k users chose between the following interests:  Screenshot_20220911-194127_Chrome719\u00d7577 74.8 KB     And one more thing. Problems must be foreseen, and solutions must be found early. The amount of OP delegated decreased in season 1, from 35.4M to 23.4M (-33%).  Screenshot_20220912-082934_Chrome719\u00d7302 43.3 KB  The decrease in the amount of OP tokens that have been delegated is not proportional, the number of delegates that can approve proposals is reduced, and the percentage voting power of the top 10 delegates increases relative to the rest of the delegates.

One more important item to add which I believe would actually drive more delegate diversity is to first prioritize adding the rest of the delegates to be visible on that page.

I was about to open a feedback thread to point that same thing. Are you familiar with the nudge concept?  en.wikipedia.org    Nudge theory Nudge theory is a concept in behavioral economics, decision making, behavioral policy, social psychology, consumer behavior, and related behavioral sciences that proposes adaptive designs of the decision environment (choice architecture) as ways to influence the behavior and decision-making of groups or individuals. Nudging contrasts with other ways to achieve compliance, such as education, legislation or enforcement.  The nudge concept was popularized in the 2008 book Nudge: Improving Decisions ...       People are lazy by nature. When I finally claimed my OP tokens I delegated \u201crandomly\u201d, later seeing the statistics I realized it was the biggest one. I checked the default sort, and it was by weight shuffle. So I was about to suggest something like there shouldn\u2019t be a default sort priming more weight. @diligit 's idea is great: the user must select first his interest areas and according to that, the delegates will be sorted\u2026 Congrats guys for your hard work. I\u2019m impressed ",
