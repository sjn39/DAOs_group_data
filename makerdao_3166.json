                    "content": "MIP40: Budget Framework Preamble MIP#: 40 Title: Budget Framework Author(s): @juanjuan Contributors: @elprogreso, @iammeeoh Type: Process Status: Formal Submission Date Proposed: <2021-01-18> Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: MIP38, MIP39, MIP41, MIP4c2-SP10, MIP4c2-SP12 Replaces: n/a  References MIP40c2-SP-Template Sentence Summary MIP40: Budget Framework contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP. Paragraph Summary MIP40: Budget Framework contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP. The Framework includes features to provide transparency and clarity for Governance when making decisions around budgets and a design that enables a high degree of flexibility in implementing payment structures for the Core Units. Component Summary MIP40c1: Budget Framework Gives an overview of the most critical characteristics of Budgets. MIP40c2: Composition of a Budget Describes the components of a Core Unit Budget proposal. MIP40c3: Adding/Modifying Core Unit Budget Process Describes the process for adding a budget to a new Core Unit or modifying the Core Unit\u2019s existing budget. MIP40c4: Budget Implementation Details Provides clarity on how the budget payouts are addressed from a practical perspective once approved. Motivation The Budget Framework MIP allows Governance to manage and prioritize Core Units in a standardized way, promoting transparency and reducing Governance overhead and minimizing abuse and increase fairness in the budget process. The budget system gives Facilitators the flexibility to modify their plans away from the initially submitted budget breakdown if conditions were to change. If they need to allocate the money differently, this would be possible but never exceeding the aggregate amount defined by their Budget Implementation code. The Framework can help Governance guide a given Core Unit, as they could vote (or not) to attach multiple budgets to a Core Unit, each with a different, more specific objective. Specification / Proposal Details MIP40c1: Budget Framework Budgets are used to fund the work defined by the Core Units chosen by Maker Governance. A budget is attached to a Core Unit and is meant to be used only for that Core Unit. The Facilitators of each Core Unit administer core Unit budgets. The Core Unit Facilitators must ensure that transparency and accountability exist as the budget is spent. If a Facilitator is offboarded from their Core Unit, quits, or goes missing, the budget will continue to be available to pay out according to its Budget Implementation to allow the Core Unit to continue with long-term operations as much as possible. See MIP41c6 for details on this process. MIP40c2: Composition of a Budget Core Unit Budgets can have multiple entries. Each entry has both a Budget Breakdown and a Budget Implementation. Having multiple budget entries, each with its implementation and breakdown, enables more advanced compensation and funding structures to be created if desired. Once a budget is approved, the Core Unit\u2019s Facilitators can begin drawing payments to fund their Core Unit according to their Budget Implementation. Budget Breakdown The Budget Breakdown component consists of the Core Unit Facilitators\u2019 best guess breakdown of spending for their Core Unit during the budget period. The Budget Breakdown component is non-binding and is intended to encourage transparency and communication between the Core Unit Facilitators and Maker Governance. The breakdown allows Maker Governance to make a more informed decision when deciding whether to approve the budget. Budget Implementation The Budget Implementation defines when and how the Core Unit Facilitators will receive the funds that make up their budget. Unlike the breakdown, the Budget Implementation is binding. It should be understood to directly authorize the proposed funds to be drawn from the funding source (either the Maker Protocol or a treasury contract controlled by Maker Governance). MIP40c3: Adding/Modifying Core Unit Budget Process This subproposal process modifies the Budget Implementations and Budget Breakdowns entries of a Core Unit in the DAO Primitives State. Once a MIP40c2-SP subproposal passes, the Governance Facilitators or the MIP Editors will update the domain state MIP (MIP38) accordingly. This is a technical process component that can have on-chain effects that alter the Maker Protocol\u2019s state. When subproposals generated from this component reach the executive vote stage of the MIPs cycle, the executive vote must include a technical state change to authorize the budget implementations specified in the subproposal to draw funds from the Maker Protocol. The proposal parameters are:  Minimum feedback period: 1 month. Minimum frozen period: 1 week.   MIP40c4: Budget Implementation Details Core Unit Budgets are paid out through Budget Implementations, which are smart contracts authorized by Maker Governance to draw funds from the Protocol. It can also be a manual (not smart contract-based) pre-approval by Governance. Facilitators can propose simple, manual or advanced Budget Implementations that will control their access to the Core Unit\u2019s budget. Maker Governance can explicitly turn a budget implementation off. Simple Budget Implementations Simple Budget Implementations create a fixed rate of funds taken from the Protocol and given directly to the Core Unit\u2019s Facilitators. Simple Budget Implementations can be used for reliable base expenses, even if MKR has to be diluted to fund them. This feature makes them useful for creating job security and attracting talent. Manual Budget Implementations Manual Budget Implementations are discouraged but exist as a backup solution that can stand in if a Simple Budget Implementation isn\u2019t available for any given reason. Manual Budget Implementations aren\u2019t based on a smart contract but rather on Governance, giving a Facilitator the power to use the governance cycle to draw funds at the rate specified in the DAO Primitives State. Manual Budget Implementations should be replaced by smart contract-based solutions as soon as possible to reduce Governance overhead. Advanced Budget Implementations Advanced Budget Implementations cover any mechanism beyond the Simple and Manual Implementations described above. Advanced Budget Implementations can be used for more innovative cases, such as incentive payments or unpredictable expenses. They can be implemented in various ways, such as relying on multi-sig access or dependent on system variables such as Protocol auctions, Dai supply or Stability Fees. Advanced Budget Implementations can also be used to hard-code payment streams to long-term contributors or other automated distribution mechanisms that bypass Core Unit Facilitators and send funds directly to contributors. Different Fund Types The Budget Implementation could draw funds from the Protocol in various ways, depending on the implementation\u2019s objective. It could draw Dai from the Surplus Buffer and other sources, such as Governance owned smart contracts or reserves that are compatible with Budget Implementations, or by getting authorization to print MKR directly. Printing MKR through this MIP is only allowed if the MKR is to be distributed with a programmed time-lock of at least 12 months. Budget Implementations that don\u2019t verifiably distribute MKR with at least a 12-month time lock cannot be proposed through this MIP.    Edit: Incorporated feedback for clarity, added to my github (accepting PRs) and also PRed the Maker Github. Thanks to @blimpa, @Deimos, @LongForWisdom, and everyone else that helped with the revision. Edit2: removed the MIP4c2-SP11 from dependencies, moved to formal submission. ",

                    "content": "    juan:  Motivation The Budget Framework MIP drives funding and coordination around Core Units. Governance needs to be able to manage and prioritize Core Units, and needs a standardized and robust framework that promotes transparency in order to minimize abuse and increase fairness in the budget process.   Again, should go more in-depth if possible. Why this implementation over some other implementation.     juan:  MIP40c1: Definitions of the Budget Framework MIP   Bullet points are maybe not the best way of formatting this. Again, better than wall of text, but could use better formatting to be more reader-friendly.     juan:  Budgets are mainly spent on paying Contributors, which are a diverse set of roles that encompass anyone who works on a Core Unit,   I don\u2019t think this should be included. It\u2019s a value judgement that may not be true for all Core Units, or all budgets.     juan:  Examples of Contributors are:   Also not sure that this belongs in this MIP. Why are we defining what contributors are in a budget MIP?     juan:  Contributors can take many more shapes and sizes - the main thing they have in common is that they are funded by Core Unit Budgets and interact with Facilitators.   I\u2019m also not sure that it\u2019s true that all contributors will be funded by Core Unit budgets. Some contributors aren\u2019t paid, some will be paid by outside interests, etc.     juan:  Core Unit Budgets can have multiple entries.   What does this mean? Multiple versions?     juan:  Each entry has both a Budget Implementation, and a Budget Breakdown. The Budget Implementations are technically binding as they directly authorize one or more specific Budget Implementations with predetermined logic with authority to call the suck() function, so the Core Unit Facilitator can begin drawing payments to fund their plans from the Maker Surplus Buffer within the boundaries defined in the code of the Budget Implementation.   This should be structured better. Key parts of this component are Budget Implementations and Budget Breakdowns. They deserve subheadings. Also, this is a bad explanation of what a Budget Implementation actually is. There should be a sentence that says something like \u2018A budget implementation is a method and agreement of  how to deliver the agreed funds into the control of the Core Unit Facilitator from the Maker Protocol\u2019 (or something, I\u2019m not 100% sure that is what this is.) Also, since sucks each require a governance vote to pass, they are not binding, even if the MIP wants them to be (and even though they should be.)     juan:  In contrast, the Budget Breakdowns component is non-binding, and is used to inform the reasoning and specific parameters of The Budget Implementations, so Maker Governance can be better informed in making a decision when deciding whether to approve the budget.   Again, we\u2019re missing a sentence clearly stating \u2018A budget breakdown is\u2026\u2019     juan:  A crucial feature of the budget system is that it gives Facilitators the flexibility they need to modify their plans away from the initially submitted budget breakdown. If conditions change, and the money needs to be spent differently, this would be possible. However, it can never exceed the aggregate amount defined by the code of their Budget Implementation, so the possibility for abuse is limited.   This is stated weirdly. I think the target statements are \u2018Facilitators have the authority to deviate from their stated budget breakdown as much as they feel is necessary as long as they can justify how it helps them achieve the goals of their Core Unit.\u2019 and \u2018Facilitators cannot exceed their aggregate amount defined by their budget implementation.\u2019 Comments on why these statements are included belong in the motivation section.     juan:  Once a MIP40c2-SP subproposal passes, the domain state is updated to modify the Core Unit specified with the new values for budget and budget breakdown.   Who updates this\u2026     juan:  This subproposal process is a technical subproposal that can have on-chain effects that alter the state of the Maker Protocol. When subproposals of this subproposal process goes to the executive vote stage of the monthly MIPs cycle, the executive vote must include a technical state change to authorize the budget implementations specified in the subproposal with access to call the suck() function.   Defining the suck function here forces us to use that implementation method. This should be more general such that it can apply to the keg, or whatever other methods we use in the future.     juan:  MIP40c3: Budget Payout Process   This should come before MIP40c2. Also maybe just renamed to \u2018Budget Implementations.\u2019 Or maybe Budget Distribution or somesuch. Maybe avoid the word process given this isn\u2019t a process component. Also, same issue with wall-of-bulletpoints.     juan:  Core Unit Budgets are paid out through Budget Implementations, which are smart contracts that are authorized by Maker Governance to call the suck() function in order to directly draw Dai out of the Maker Surplus Buffer, or a manual (not smart contract-based) pre-approval by Governance to use the weekly cycle to access suck().   This does not take into account Advanced Budget Implementations that do not use suck. I would probably split this section into \u2018Manual, Simple and Advanced\u2019 budget implementations.     juan:  Simple Budget Implementations create a fixed rate of funds that are taken from the Surplus Buffer through recurrent suck() calls and given directly to the Facilitator.   Not a good idea (and something I\u2019m not personally comfortable with,) funds should be held by a multisig.     juan:  even if MKR has to be diluted through flap auctions to fund them, or the current Facilitator is removed.   Many will not understand the mechanism at play here, so it should be explained in more detail.     juan:  Printing MKR through this MIP is only allowed if the MKR is distributed with a programmed time lock of at least 12 months. Budget Implementations that don\u2019t verifiably distribute MKR with at least a 12-month time lock cannot be proposed through this MIP.   I have no idea why this is here or what it\u2019s referring to. Is it referring to the print of MKR due to fixed suck calls with a zero surplus buffer. Is it referring to people being paid in MKR? I assumed this was locked to DAI, if it isn\u2019t locked to DAI, maybe it should be? I would just fix this to payments in DAI, and if we want to budget in MKR we handle it in a different MIP. ",
