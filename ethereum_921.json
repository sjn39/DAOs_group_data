The tragedy is how it is unclear when an EIP editor is just giving feedback or demanding changes, but Nick here got into the proposal, and seemed to be trying to help refine the spec, imho. https://t.co/mrEQVQjv6e       Loredana Cirstea @lorecirstea           I view dType & Alias as a project of collaboration with the community. ENS could for, example, support the Alias part for dType (even on top of the current format), and define & manage some of the types in dType.           11:51 PM - 31 Aug 2019     3              twitter.com          Loredana Cirstea (lorecirstea)     Timeline thread \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/AP3XwQnJQ3       Dan Finlay @danfinlay           It looks like a bit of miscommunication to me.

Pinged an editor on April 6th for EIP number - no response   Wrote 3 articles about dType parts: https://medium.com/@loredana.cirstea   Made 3 video demos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL323JufuD9JC46yClCf5fdaEX17kocem7   All shared on Twitter & Reddit, EIPs on EIP Gitter chat   https://twitter.com/jemenger/status/1143655108896362497   The article mentions the Draft PR, exactly where the opcode section was (NJ now says he did not see it). NJ was interested. I also gave him the issue link to discuss.First EIP editor interested!   1- NJ comments were useful - I said as much. But, up to a point, when he wanted to close the discussion because I wouldn\u2019t do as he proposed. And kept asking for more and more content, even after I limited the EIP scope. 2 - My PR was unmerged, the only editor looking was stopping collaboration, while he was promoting fast Draft merging without technical soundness check - after the whole EIP999. So, I did not understand why he would not merge it after spending so much time on it.   July 2nd: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1882#issuecomment-507619192 I say: \u201cTherefore, I do not see a reason to deny merging of this ERC Draft to master\u201d. NJ still did not review/merge the PR.   July 2-4: I made proposals for EIP editors: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+editors+author%3Aloredanacirstea   EIP1900 merged July 7th - not by NJ though.   @danfinlay , if you still think there are lapses in logic & I was overreacting, I can spend 30-60 min to go through the EIP discussion with you (not on Twitter, but on ETHMagicians, Gitter, etc.) & hear what I could have done better at each point.

So first of all, the EIP process is slow, and it\u2019s run by volunteers, and that sucks. I think he needed to be clear when he was communicating as an editor and when not, and I think he even agrees about that. I didn\u2019t see instances of him being specifically abusive. Some of the worst things you claimed out were things like pinging EIP editors, and getting no response, and I confirmed you waited like 3 months for EIP 1900 to be merged, but you had only pinged nick savers. Maybe you meant to ping Nick Johnson there, and maybe this is why you thought he was being abusive? I think the EIP process seems overwhelmed right now, I also have submissions that are not being actively interacted with, but I just assume people are busy, I don\u2019t assume it\u2019s malice. From your timeline, I didn\u2019t see any instance of Nick being directly abusive to you on Github nor Twitter (maybe you could still link to examples, but they weren\u2019t there), but you did act fairly cruel once you had decided Nick was acting against you. I feel like a lot of this is frustration that there hasn\u2019t been wider community embrace of your proposals, and I mostly side with my earlier thought, that most people are just busy and distracted. I tend to agree with the saying \u201cGenius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.\u201d The ideas you\u2019ve shared may be great, and inevitable, and maybe they make ENS obsolete, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive to get defeated when sharing an idea doesn\u2019t make it take off in a 3 day window. I think tools like dType and pipeline are useful even one user at a time, and maybe you don\u2019t want to do it, but maybe you need a teammate who is willing to go talking to developers one at a time, and showing them how it works, why it saves them time, how it makes their contracts more composable. The first ~6 months of MetaMask was a big education effort. Most dapps built wallets into the site by default, and storing keys in an extension was not at all an intuitive next step. It can take a while to educate people into new paradigms. I\u2019m a huge fan of your work, and I first started following you because I was also interested in graph-based smart contract authoring, but MetaMask keeps me so busy, I can\u2019t read every proposal by anyone, even my favorite thinkers. Things fall through the cracks. Helping people allocate their attention to the highest-impact things is one thing I\u2019d love to see come out of blockchain, but until we have that, we have to be sympathetic to the fact that our listeners are mortal, they have limited attention and energy and time in the day, and no matter how good our ideas are, most of the value will always come from the labor of implementation, not from the idea itself. A few times you expressed irritation at people who you perceived as being dense, or not attentive enough. I think this attitude is sometimes getting directly in the way of people who might otherwise want to learn more about the systems you\u2019re proposing. Infrastructure like type systems may not get viral buzz like a hot ICO, but I wish that wasn\u2019t as demotivating to you. Anyways, I wish good ideas always won, but ideas transmit by communication, and sometimes that communication can be tedious, and repetitive, but that\u2019s communication, and it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. I hope you find a way to rally the support you deserve without feeling slighted. ",

But I hope it is not because of the medium or lack of time.  Instead, it was maybe getting angry when no malice was intended.  Then this will be the next point.  If you\u2019re going to take one point at a time, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to maintain the discussion  I think there is no other way to clarify a situation.  I might suggest a forum like kialo  You offered me the option to choose the medium and I thought the EIP process discussion could be useful here. We can use kialo (which seems great) for the other, unrelated topics. ",

                    "content": "@danfinlay, I do not want us to forget the state in which this discussion is, so I am pressing ahead. Since you seem to not have time, I will make an assumption and answer the question for you. So, I will assume the first instance is in: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1882#issuecomment-507619192  I suggest you pay attention to how clearly you phrase your questions before being unsatisfied with the answer.  The sequence of interactions that resulted in my above phrase is:       One interface can have many implementations, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any distinction made between the two here. comment            LC: Are you referring to the dType registry interface and implementation or to the type library? comment          No, I\u2019m talking about the distinction between a type definition and an implementation. For example, the ERC20 standard defines some types, which are implemented by a large number of different contracts. Capturing the ability for a type to have many implementations seems like a pretty basic feature to support. comment     If the word types has the exact same meaning in both ERC20 standard defines some types and in ability for a type to have many implementations, then:  The ERC20 standard defines functions types and devs can indeed implement the functions as they please. ERC20 function types can be defined & registered as types in dType. Devs can still implement them as they please.  But, I assumed that the problem was with non-function types. And from this perspective, the ERC20 example is a bad example (I was confused because of it).  Solidity is statically typed -> building a type system on top of it is restrictive -> the best solution that we found is one based on structs. when you describe a custom struct with dType, you can generate its implementation -> devs are not free to change the implementation, which is an automation feature; but devs are those who propose the type description in the first place.  Therefore, my answer:    LC: Devs have the freedom to implement type helper functions, as long as the required ones are implemented (to be discussed). As for the definition, I am open to other proposals that not necessarily based on structs. I am actually trying to have optional subtypes, that can be stored with map. dType registry will be extended with an additional optionals field in the dType struct & a standardized way to define optionals in the Type Library, but this is not ready yet. Other than this, what can I do more to give more freedom to the implementation comment      I still think you\u2019re not understanding the difference between an interface and an implementation. An interface describes an API for other code to interact with, but not how it\u2019s implemented. What you\u2019re proposing here seems to be more along the lines of a directory of library code. [\u2026] [the spec] doesn\u2019t make a clear distinction between interfaces and implementations. I wish you luck, but I don\u2019t plan to offer further technical feedback. comment   At this point I was expecting references to the lines of code that were the culprit (one big reason why we use GitHub & PR reviews) and some pointers as to what can I do to fix them. But here, the assumption was that I do not know the general difference between an interface and an implementation. I still do not know what the exact problem was. If someone knows exactly, please explain.  LC: I asked you before: \u201cAre you referring to the dType registry interface and implementation or to the type library?\u201d, to which you answered with \u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the distinction between a type definition and an implementation\u201d. I suggest you pay attention to how clearly you phrase your questions before being unsatisfied with the answer. I thought it was clear that this ERC aims to both:  standardize type libraries propose a unique type registry to be implemented (anyone can make their own registry, and the interface is defined here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/8d46acbaaead36b2063dc31fbfbf4fca1e34e621/EIPS/eip-1900.md#dtype-registry-data-structures-and-interface, but it is beneficial to have a unique registry and I explained why already) comment    So, regarding this interface-implementation criticism, the status was:  comparison with ERC20, which is a different type of standard no reference to any lines of code/spec no code/spec examples this criticism was used as one of the reasons for stopping any further technical feedback  Considering the above, do you consider my phrase: \u201cI suggest you pay attention to how clearly you phrase your questions before being unsatisfied with the answer.\u201d as being untrue? Did I not point out the exact problem that I was facing? If I become aware of a problem, I will voice it - it is the only way to help the communication advance. Overlooking makes me feel like a hypocrite and it does not help any discussion party understand or improve. @danfinlay, if you think my comment is coming off as unwarranted hostility, please help me rephrase it. @Arachnid, if you think I misunderstood your quoted words from above or if you have any material that I overlooked, let me know.

How would you represent ERC20 or another standard, where the standard defines an interface that can have multiple independent implementations, in DType? ERC20 and others define an interface in the form of an ABI, and specify some constraints on their behaviour, but do not prescribe an implementation. Many different contract instances can be accessed using this interface, without the caller having to care about how it is implemented. DType, in contrast, seems to assume each type will have exactly one implementation. ",

I already said:   The ERC20 standard defines functions types and devs can indeed implement the functions as they please. ERC20 function types can be defined & registered as types in dType. Devs can still implement them as they please.  non-function types:  Solidity is statically typed -> building a type system on top of it is restrictive -> the best solution that we found is one based on structs. when you describe a custom struct with dType, you can generate its implementation -> devs are not free to change the implementation, which is an automation feature; but devs are those who propose the type description in the first place.    As for the definition, I am open to other proposals that not necessarily based on structs.  So:  functions are described with dType by registering their ABI -> implementation is left to the dev (not all types have exactly one implementation) non-function types indeed have a deterministic implementation  We never said this is an interface system, but a type system. However, the registry itself has an interface and could be implemented differently by others. Types intended to be used in the EVM need to have a deterministic implementation - types are not interfaces and devs + machines need to know what to expect:  a type definition library a type definition struct  standardized names + ABI structure for additional type checking library functions (implementation is left to the dev) a set of standard functions for type manipulation (implementation is left to the dev)  Also, this is an example of how one can build types visually: https://pipeos-one.github.io/visual-dtype. The main output is a JSON that will be stored in the registry. From this JSON you could also build & deploy the type automatically if you do not know how to code & want the easy way. Note: Devs can create their own types (up to 2^256-1), with another name, if they are unhappy with an already registered type. ",

It seems you\u2019ve had a lot of time to respond, and I\u2019m willing to respond as I\u2019m able, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not synchronous, there are many important things competing for my attention right now. I will try to get back to this, but if you\u2019re going to read slow delays as unacceptable disinterest or even \u201cnot giving you time for rebuttal\u201d, then I will just leave it alone, as it seems like I may be doing more harm than good.     loredanacirstea:  @danfinlay, you should at least post a clarification to https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1168187079089508352 , saying that I did not miscommunicate, as you conceded in this comment.   Thanks for highlighting the most important thing for me to reply on. From what I can tell, the hostility began around June 2. Phrases like:  I suggest you pay attention to how clearly you phrase your questions before being unsatisfied with the answer. So aside from your destructive (as opposed to constructive) and your inexact criticism, what can I do?  I totally get that this was frustration at not getting merged, but I would also point out that at no point during this issue discussion do you link to the pull request that you\u2019re referring to, so I could imagine that Nick didn\u2019t even realize there was a PR that you were suggesting, and didn\u2019t see himself as blocking at all. There were also lots of instances of hostility in the more recent twitter thread. Anyways, I\u2019m not judging, I really do understand the frustration with the EIP process, I have EIPs that also do not get merges or comments. I\u2019m just answering your question so you can hopefully understand why from my perspective, this just looks like a misunderstanding that got escalated. I\u2019ll try to review the other comments soon, sorry for the regular absence, it is not meant in bad spirit. ",

Abuse on time, on effort, etc. For my case (EIP process), this abuse was:   months between the EIP PR and merging; merging only happened after I started proposing EIP editor processes   Arachnid did not understand dType, but still gave recommendations on how to write; first were ok and I complied; second ones, talking about the intrinsic tech demonstrated a lack of knowledge on the topic, which he was unwilling to admit or consider   I did not accuse him of not understanding what a type system is (i.e. not interfaces), but he did accuse me of not understanding the difference between an implementation and an interface   his status gives him the power to abuse even unwillingly; he did not understand the proposal and dismissed it   Arachnid can also consider that he was abused (time, effort, etc.). But he is an instrument & influencer of the EIP process. You started this discussion by voicing your conclusions. And the conclusions were:  Loredana was rude for no reason if a process does not work/abuse happens, then you should be nice and take it  Now, you are an obstacle to clarifying these problems because you have:  opened a lot of subjects without the intent to follow through because you then say you don\u2019t have time returned to a subject that has already been explained, seemingly not accepting the arguments already given and not answering my questions on that subject; You should present counter-arguments to the arguments that I gave, not acting like the subject was not even touched (e.g. \u201cI suggest you pay attention to how clearly you phrase your questions before being unsatisfied with the answer.\u201d) not retreated the Twitter statements that you conceded  If you like to stay abused, at least do not block others who do not. I consider that I have a duty to me and others to fight against the abuse that I can directly see. ",

The tragedy is how it is unclear when an EIP editor is just giving feedback or demanding changes, but Nick here got into the proposal, and seemed to be trying to help refine the spec, imho. https://t.co/mrEQVQjv6e Loredana Cirstea @lorecirsteaI view dType & Alias as a project of collaboration with the community. ENS could for, example, support the Alias part for dType (even on top of the current format), and define & manage some of the types in dType.    11:51 PM - 31 Aug 2019     3            On 5th of September :  twitter.com    Dan Finlay (danfinlay)  @lorecirstea I finished reviewing this timeline, and creating my own, and my analysis is similar to my initial one, I don't think there was malice, but misunderstanding. I could share my notes, or we could review the events in a channel of your choice. Je-Meng @jemenger from @lorecirstea.   \"Ethereum can still make the first move if it starts adopting a type system.\"  https://medium.com/@loredana.cirstea/ethereum-libra-and-a-unified-type-system-7cafa6ea0bc0\u00a0\u2026    9:50 AM - 1 Sep 2019     1            You accepted a debate in public that happens in this conversation. On 6th of September, to the initial statement you added  other statements [Case discussion on the EIP process, based on EIP-1900 & EIP-1 - #2 by loredanacirstea] that themselves would take some time to unpack.  \u201cThis has been an intensely busy period for me, and while I wanted to give to this discussion, I gave what I could, and I did not have as much to spare as I expected or hoped.\u201d  You are participating in a debate that you started. If now you do not have the time or the will to continue, the gentlemanly thing to do is to concede all or any points that you presented. We still have to see you conceding the very first one in the original medium: on twitter. Especially after you conceded it here in comment  \u201cYou can accuse me of misrepresenting my intentions, but I didn\u2019t, and that accusation just further cements my opinion on this matter, that I don\u2019t have interest in being a part of this discussion anymore, and I\u2019d appreciate no further pings on the thread.\u201d  You have misrepresented your intentions in several instances:  When you pretended to concede but you are not acting on it When you start a debate but are not answering to the arguments presented by the other party, but only repeat your own. That bogs down the conversation because the other party is required to repeat the overlooked arguments. So at the level of intention: you do not want to have a meaningful debate. When you say you do not have the time to continue, but you had enough time to start several issues. When you further (meta) misrepresent your intent when you dismiss a clear and reasonable demonstration of you misrepresenting your intent. When you leave the debate with the imposition on others to not extract conclusions: \u201cno further pings on the thread\u201d  If I am mistaken in the above, I welcome the arguments in the renewed debate  I am not sure if the readers of this discussion are here for the stated title or just for your debate with @loredanacirstea on side-topics. I do think the stated title is more deserving of our attention than the debate, but I think we should be hygienic about approaching the main subject and first close the secondary discussions correctly.
