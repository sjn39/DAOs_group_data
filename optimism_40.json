I purpose that Holders of $OP that don\u2019t instantly sell back for ETH right away should be rewarded. Weather its access to new apps on Op or possibly a bonus drop of $OP for the true members of the collective. The same issue with airdrops seems to be consistent and people instantly dump who dont even stay long enough for us as members and the team to actually execute what\u2019s purposed. The people who just quickly sold are impatient and just want a quick buck. So i feel an incentive based purpose for members who truly care about the growth of OP should be given a small bonus for their efforts and support. I truly believe in what optimism is doing and the integration of L2 is going to be MASSIVE! Qucker and cheaper  is going to make a mark in this space once people see the true value. If someone has more in depth suggestions id love to hear em. I read a ton last night but im really new to L2 and its capabilities and what optimism truly can do. ",

Do we really want airdrop hunters and dumpers to be the ones participating in governance anyways?  Let them dump and the OP will make its way into the right hands.  The real issue here seems to be that people are concerned with short-term price.  If we are holders, then who cares what the short-term price is. Perhaps I am missing something, and I do not understand why people dumping OP harms Optimism.  In all honesty, if there is something I am not understanding, please teach me. ",
