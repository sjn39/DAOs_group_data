                    "content": " What are you going to build?: A Web3 Educational and Training Program  Why is what you are going to build going to succeed?:  The opportunities in Web3 are limitless but without proper education, it would be difficult to take full advantage of these opportunities. We at ProXifyDAO believe that Web3 education is the most important step for Web3 to reach mass adoption and become as mainstream as Web2. We will solve the problem of onboarding by creating a proper working schedule that allows the students to transition into various Web3 working groups easily. We are creating a unique program that is easy to understand for everyday people, we are looking to build the most comprehensive Web3 courses ever. The major reason we believe we will succeed, however, is that our education program goes beyond just teaching the participants. The robust program teaches and provides industrial experience to enrollees during the course of the program and provides on-chain certifications at its end to help them build their on-chain resumes. On top of this, we would also be providing real time mentorship on request of enrollees.   Is your project likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem? If so, please describe how: Yes, our Web3 education course is likely to bring new builders to the Optimism ecosystem. By providing a comprehensive and accessible curriculum on Web3 and its various applications, we aim to lower the barriers to entry for individuals and teams interested in building on Optimism. The course will cover the fundamentals of Web3, including blockchain technology, decentralized applications (dApps), and smart contracts, as well as more advanced topics such as scaling solutions like Optimism. By teaching people how to build in Web3 and providing them with the knowledge and resources they need to get started, we can help attract new builders to the Optimism ecosystem. Moreover, the course will provide participants with hands-on experience in building on Optimism through practical exercises and projects(bootcamps). This will not only increase their skills but also incentivize them to continue building on the Optimism network after completing the course.  Provide us with links to any of the following for the project:  Twitter: https://twitter.com/ProXifyDAO  Technical/Economic Documentation: Who are we? - ProXify DAO    Who are your competitors?: We do not see anyone as competitors. What is of utmost importance to us is that we push towards the mass adoption of Web3. We are even more than willing to collaborate with other projects that share our vision.  Who are your founders?: Mati Michael Hamzat Temi Olokoji  What makes your founders well-positioned to accomplish your goals with this project (1-2 sentences on each)?: Mati Michael is vastly experienced in DAO operations and project management. He is the DAO Organization Lead at PopcornDAO after working as a DAO core Operations Contributor at Aragon. Hamzat Temi is a seasoned content strategist and the community hub Lead at DIA DAO . Olokoji is a DAO legal analyst and crypto policy researcher who has been in the Web3 ecosystem for over 2 years now. He has a very vast understanding of the inner workings of the ecosystem and is willing to share this experience with every one.  Tell us about the rest of your team (if there are more teammates): Eric Jin \u2013 blockchain full-stack developer. Scott Peters \u2013 branding and marketing strategist. Alo Precious \u2013 DeSci growth and communications at Molecule.  Is this your first Web3 project?: Yes  I understand that Builders grants are subject to a 1-year lock-up, as explained further in this post 3: [Yes/No]: Yes  Is your project funded? If so, provide an estimate of how many months of funding runway your project has: No  What is the size of the grant request? (50k OP max): 20k OP  How do you justify the size of the grant? The grant will be geared towards covering the cost of the development, implementation and follow-up of the educational program. These costs include research, creation of the educational content (syllabus, modules, videos), team/individual projects, campaigns, contributor compensation, tooling and operational costs.  Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:   Define the curriculum: The first step will be to define the curriculum for the program, which will cover topics such as blockchain basics, smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.   Develop the course content: The team will then work together to develop the course content, which will include instructional videos, written materials, and hands-on exercises.   Test the course content: Once the course content is developed, it will be tested with a small group of beta testers to ensure that it is effective and easy to understand.   Refine the course content: Based on feedback from the beta testers, we will refine the course content to make it even more effective and user-friendly.   Launch the course: Once the course content is finalized, we will launch the course on a hosted platform (Moodle).   Promote the course: To ensure that the course reaches as many people as possible, we will promote it through social media, advertising, and other channels.   Feedback and Quality Control: As people take the course, we will get and monitor feedback and make adjustments as needed.   Expansion and Evolution: As Web3 technologies continue to evolve, the team will continue to expand the course content to cover new developments and advancements.    Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contract addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.) eth:0x2F776fb0171f8b921073916970886d9353D88321 matic:0x2F2A49739C74eadF64B561DF9d53eB2dd4254B95  Does your plan depend on the receipt of OP tokens?: No  What is your plan for using the OP token after the 1-year lock-up?: We have a 3-phase distribution plan  Payment for contributors and tools: we intend to use a portion of the OP tokens to compensate contributors who have worked on the development of the education course and associated tools, such as the platform where the course will be hosted. These contributors could include developers, educators, and others who have played a role in creating and promoting the course. Campaigns: OP in the second phase will be used to fund various campaigns aimed at promoting the Web3 education course and increasing awareness of Web3 technologies. Enrollee and project incentives: When enrollees complete the course, we have a high-level plan to sponsor them to carry on group/individual projects that involve building on Optimism.   Please provide benchmark milestones for this project. These milestones should guide the Optimism community on the progress of your project during the 1-year lock-up period. April - May, 2023:  Conduct market research and identify the target audience (mostly Web2 folks and Africans) for the Web3 education program. Define the program\u2019s curriculum, goals, and learning outcomes. Divide our instructors according to their strengths and experience in Web3 and blockchain technology.  June - September, 2023  Create the course materials, including presentations, videos, and interactive learning activities. Develop a Learning Management System (LMS) to deliver the course content and track progress. Conduct a pilot program with a small group of students and collect feedback to refine the curriculum (beta testing).  September - October, 2023: *Launch the first cohort of the Web3 education program.  Monitor student progress and engagement and make any necessary adjustments to the program. Host regular office hours and Q&A sessions with instructors to provide additional support to students.  November, 2023:  Expand the program to reach a larger audience through targeted marketing and outreach efforts. Add additional course modules and content to the program based on student feedback and market demand. Host community events and hackathons to encourage students to apply their learning to real-world projects.  December, 2023:  Evaluate the program\u2019s success and impact by collecting feedback from students, measuring learning outcomes, and tracking job placement rates. Use the insights gained to further improve the program and prepare for future cohorts. Create a sustainability plan to ensure the Web3 education program can continue to operate and thrive beyond the grant period.  January, 2024:  Cohort 2 begins. Preparations to launch the Web3 education program fully on Optimism begins.   Please define critical milestones for this project. Critical milestones are meant to show good-faith efforts to accomplish the project. Non-completion of these milestones could lead to the revocation of remaining grant rewards. the critical milestones for this project are as follows:  Curriculum curation and Content Creation: Creating high-quality, comprehensive educational content that covers various aspects of Web3 technology and its applications.
