Summary Statement The Capital Markets team of END-Labs (END Capital) is proposing to become approved as an \u2018Attestor\u2019 (role as contemplated in the Maker \u2018Arranger\u2019 model) to act as both Underwriting Agent and Blockchain Agent on select Bank Participation Vaults, acting on behalf of Maker, on an as-needed basis, and interfacing with the Maker Delegated Committee.  As Underwriting Agent, END Capital will facilitate, underwrite, manage, and monitor the credit risk of loan participations for the benefit of Maker, and END Capital will provide regular updates to the Maker Delegated Committee on the credit performance of the loan participations. Additionally, based on the findings from the credit risk surveillance, END Capital will make recommendations on any appropriate actions for Maker as a senior lender, and will carry out those recommendations upon the approval of the Maker Delegated Committee. In doing so, END Capital will help ensure alignment of interest between Maker and banks selling loan participations. As Blockchain Agent, END-Labs will work with the transaction parties, as needed, to manage the fiat on- and off-ramps as it pertains to the delivery of DAI related to the periodic payments of principal and interest on the loan participations; additionally, END-Labs will either manage directly, or through third parties, the on-chain transition of related off-chain assets.   1281\u00d7742 51.9 KB  Background END-Labs is a 25-person team comprised of blockchain product managers & engineers (our dev team) and capital markets professionals (END Capital). Our END Capital team has over 40 years of combined experience originating, underwriting, and investing in asset-backed loan portfolios in aggregate totaling in excess of $500 million of transactions. \u200b\u200bThe range of assets which our team has transacted in is very broad, ranging from mainstream consumer credit (auto, housing, unsecured lending, etc.) to merchant cash advances/small business lending, content/IP financing (film/music receivables), Amazon merchant financing, litigation finance, short term worker financing (\u2018gig\u2019 economy), real estate bridge loans, and many other types of assets. 1. END Capital in TradFi On asset-backed transactions which our team has been involved with originating, executing, and managing, we have consistently achieved stable risk adjusted returns, while achieving $0 loss of principal, by utilizing rigorous borrower diligence, and extensive structuring and financial modeling expertise to stress-test underlying default rates to understand at what point these loans become impaired to create structures which then mitigate that impairment if/when underlying default rates increase (including early warning asset performance triggers, financial covenants, cash controls, turbo structures and other protective mechanisms). Since the types of loans which our Capital Markets team has historically transacted in have generally been riskier than bank loans, the required demands of rigorous borrower selection, and precision underwriting have historically been even more stringent than bank underwriting. 2. END Capital in DeFi Within the DeFi space, we have operated and managed several pools of capital for the purposes of investing in specialty finance loans. We launched the GIG Pool on Centrifuge\u2019s Tinlake platform in July 2021. The GIG Pool has had no defaults and has returned a blended yield of about 9% since inception. END Capital has tokenized over $8M of loans using DeFi via the GIG Pool. Please see a Dune dashboard of the GIG Pool\u2019s on-chain history here . We launched our second pool in December 2021, the Real World Asset Market (rwamarket.io) on Aave, which we created in partnership with Centrifuge to invest in a collection of the senior tranches on Tinlake. This pool currently has a total size of $7 million. Proposal\u2013Help ensure alignment of interest with Maker Bank participation structures, assuming that the seller of the participations retains at least 50% of the economic exposure, and that the buyer of the participations receive the same economic rights as the seller, generally would align Maker\u2019s interests with the counterparty\u2019s.  811\u00d7750 51.4 KB  However, there are a number of situations in which even though the bank participation structure itself is designed to align interests between the participants, incentives between the participation seller and purchaser may still not be fully aligned. 1. Adverse selection of banks One situation which the participation structure itself does not solve is the selection of which banks to acquire participations from. Of course, there is a varying range of underwriting quality amongst banks, as could be demonstrated at least in part by their historically reported loss ratios. The selection of which bank (or even which region a bank operates in) to acquire participations from could greatly influence loan participation performance. Additionally, the bank participation seller will be entirely focused on the relevant markets and industries for those loans, not only through direct discussions with the borrower, but also through discussions with parties outside of the participated loan transaction and within the industry. END Capital, as attestor and Underwriting Agent, would actively correspond with external parties to understand the terms in context of the broader market, on a regular basis. 2. Adverse loan selection & reporting within bank portfolio Another situation to be cautious of is which portion of the bank portfolio is being selected for participation. As an example, banks seeking to lower regulatory capital requirements by reducing exposure to risky assets may elect to offload risk exposure to loans with weaker credit characteristics, while retaining full exposure to loans with better credit characteristics. Thus, the loan portfolio selected for participations should be compared on a relative basis with the entirety of the bank portfolio and the bank\u2019s overall loan underwriting policy in order to prevent adverse selection. Such portion of the loan portfolio should also of course be underwritten on a standalone basis to ensure adequate performance as participations. Additionally, any reporting initiated by the borrowers facing the bank/participation seller, and reporting by the participation seller facing the participation purchaser will be limited by the capacity for additional operational costs. For instance, the participation seller may deem certain risks facing specific borrowers to be negligible given that they have a diversified exposure to a broad array of borrowers, and given that they\u2019ve sold off participations in what they may deem the riskier credits. From the participation purchaser\u2019s perspective, given that the purchaser may not have the same exposure to all of the seller\u2019s borrower counterparties, those risks that the seller deems negligible have the potential to become significant. So the purchaser would need to take an active stance to request from either the seller, or the borrower, or both, the necessary materials needed to gain comfort over those risks. 3. Bank sale of more than 50% participation in aggregate Lastly, a situation in which a bank sells more than 50% participation in certain loans in its loan portfolio can reduce alignment of interest. For example, such a scenario might involve one where a bank sells participations to two different purchasers, one of whom could be Maker, at different times - i.e. bank sells a 40% participation to one purchaser, and subsequently 30% (half of its own exposure) to Maker. In this scenario, both the bank and Maker end up owning a minority participation in the loan portfolio, with a plurality owned by a third party. Another example could be one in which a bank progressively sells a larger and larger participation in the loan portfolio, eg 50% to begin with, but then selling an additional 10%, 15% etc, to the same purchaser. Such situations can adversely affect the bank\u2019s incentives to proactively monitor and maintain appropriate risk controls on the underlying borrowers of the loan portfolio, as the bank\u2019s owned proportion of the loan portfolio participation decreases. END-Labs as \u2018Attestor\u2019 To address any potential misalignments of interest between Maker as the participation purchaser and banks as the participation sellers, END Capital stepping into the role of an Underwriting Agent, corresponding not only with the bank but also the borrowers facing the bank, would ensure that an active party will monitor the underlying loans and related collateral assets, assessing the quality and strength of the credit of the loan participations. This will be important in allowing Maker to make pre-emptive, as opposed to purely reactive, risk management decisions. In addition to more fully aligning interests on currently existing bank participation transactions, END Capital would source additional well-qualified bank participation opportunities based on a set of defined risk-return criteria. As a Capital Markets team which has an aggregate of over 40 years\u2019 experience working in private debt funds, analyzing these types and even more difficult to assess loan opportunities, we would be ideally suited in an Attestor-type role to fulfill this function. A properly incented and aligned Attestor, who could efficiently source a pipeline of bank participation opportunities, underwrite their collateral and generally assist with execution, closing and monitoring of the loan participations, would help fully align interests between Maker (which wants good risk-adjusted yield for its capital) and the loan participation sellers (who may simply want to offload risk). How does this benefit Maker? Following the introduction of the Arranger model late last year, which we view as an appropriate methodology to scale both the real-world collateral base of Maker, as well as the potential use of DAI (via institutional banks and loan originators), we believe there needs to be an Attestor who can professionally source, underwrite, structure and monitor asset-based loan participations as a way to bridge and cement alignment of interest between the participation sellers and Maker. END Capital has the ideal balance of both TradFi and DeFi experience required to assist Maker with regard to these types of assets. About END-Labs END Capital\u2019s parent company, END-Labs is focused on web3 lending infrastructure with both in-house software development and capital markets teams. The capital markets team, END Capital, accesses DeFi sources of capital to connect with fiat-native borrowers, driving greater capital efficiencies. The developer team builds rails to provide lending infrastructure to borrowers, lenders, and those that service them. We believe that the credit industry will adopt Web3 rails resulting in more increased access to capital and lower cost of capital globally. END-Labs is backed by Polychain, ConsenSys, Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Blocktower, and CRV (Charles River Ventures), among others. END-Labs\u2019 unique combination of software engineering expertise and Tradfi credit expertise enables us to serve as a bridge between Tradfi and DeFi due to an ability to solve problems/challenges in both arenas.

Yes, we certainly would expect the attestor role to include continued financial analysis and monitoring.  But we believe there is a broader role to be fulfilled as well to increase alignment of interest between bank sellers and Maker.  Over the life of the loan portfolio, there may be numerous situations varying from macro market changes to specific borrower situations which require decision making involving covenants and lender actions; for example, whether to put a loan into default/repossess collateral, whether to waive a covenant for minor infractions, whether to amend or extend a covenant for fees, etc.  In our prior experience as participants in other loan portfolios, members of our team have been part of the governance decision making for these types of situations many times.  Although Maker could simply rely on the bank seller for every decision, there may genuinely be times when it is not necessarily in Maker\u2019s best interests.  All different types of banks have varying ranges of judiciousness in terms of covenant vigilance, monitoring and enforcement.  There should be a properly incented third party which evaluates these decisions and makes recommendations to Maker as to what the best course of action may be, independent from the bank seller.  Lastly, to the point about origination, yes we would intend to onboard a pipeline of banks based on a specific set of risk-return criteria, as defined after consultation with the appropriate CUs within Maker.

We understand that there is a lot changing in the MakerDAO ecosystem right now and that this proposal is not the highest priority. However, we have been trying to follow along as closely as possibly and after reading @rune 's Endgame proposals along with @LongForWisdom 's Decentralized Workforce Endgame Summary, we wonder if this type of role fits into the decentralized workforce vision? We are a team that has a highly specialized skill set that wants to help the community evaluate and monitor HVB and any future bank participations if the community decides to proceed with this asset class.  We decided to publish this proposal during this time of change to potentially show the community how an external expert team could contribute in the RWA space. We would love to get feedback on whether we are thinking about Endgame properly and if there is a role for this type of service. We encourage you to vote in this simple proposal as an indication of interest (maybe we switch the vote from \u201capproval\u201d to \u201cindication of interest\u201d?). Of course, we can follow @flipflopflapdelegate 's suggestion and change the format if the @GovAlpha-Core-Unit provides that guidance. Thank you! ",
