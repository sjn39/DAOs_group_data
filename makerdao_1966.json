                    "content": " MIP4c2-SP30: Amend Interim Facilitator Appointment Process  Preamble MIP4c2-SP#: 30 MIP to be amended: MIP41 Author(s): @LongForWisdom Contributors: @Patrick_J Tags:  Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2022-11-28 Date Ratified: 2023-02-27 Ratification Poll URL: https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmSYNed5   Specification  Motivation The existing Interim Facilitator process has proved to be less than ideal when applied. Primarily the issues are:  Lack of speedy resolution - If the initial process fails, the Fallback Process takes at least one week. While this doesn\u2019t sound like a long time, it has the potential to cause major issues depending on the circumstances. Inflexibility - The existing process does not readily allow for modifications in processes by the Governance Facilitators in the event the circumstances are atypical.  This change should be valid for an amendment as the changes are limited in scope to a single process defined completely in MIP41. This change should not impact any other MIPs.  Amended MIPs and Components  Amended MIP41c3 - Minor fix of wording to clarify that Governance Facilitators determine whether any exercised Facilitator Governance Powers are related to the relevant Core Unit. Amended MIP41c6 - Now documents Interim Facilitator responsibilities and incentives more explicitly. Added MIP41c7 - Details the process used to appoint Interim Facilitators, and lists some edge cases and how to handle them.   Patch Notes Interim Facilitators  Limit the number of Interim Facilitators to one. This also limits the nominations to one. The incentive for acting as an Interim Facilitator is the compensation that would have been due to the Facilitator. Having multiple Interim Facilitators creates ambiguity around how this incentive is managed. In practice, the Interim Facilitator needs to act as a contact with governance and decision-maker, these requirements do not require more than a single Interim Facilitator. The maximum time an Interim Facilitator can serve is two months, this can be extended by a majority of Governance Facilitators at any time during the appointment via public communication of reasoning. This helps ensure that we never end up with a permanent Interim Facilitator. Interim Facilitators are now responsible for making a good-faith effort to find a permanent replacement (if the core unit is not being shut down.) Interim Facilitator compensation is more explicitly worded now: Equal to the previous Facilitator\u2019s compensation (if it was publicly known) or 15,000 DAI per month.  Appointment Process  Gives Governance Facilitators more explicit power to modify the appointment process to suit circumstances. Voluntary offboarding Facilitators may nominate a single Interim Facilitator, which is immediately actioned. This is intended to reduce the period of uncertainty. Other Core Units may elect a willing Interim Facilitator within 72 hours of this automatic appointment. If they do so, the initial choice by the outgoing Facilitator is replaced. This gives other Core Units the power to override the outgoing Facilitator if they deem it necessary or prudent. Core Units get a single vote on each candidate, cast by agreement of the Facilitators of that Core Unit. This prevents the case where certain Core Units have more voting power than others and removes this incentive to onboard multiple Facilitators. If no Interim Facilitator exists after 72 hours, Maker Governance may onboard a Permanent Facilitator using the weekly process via subproposal disregarding feedback and frozen periods. If after one month, the core unit has neither an Interim Facilitator nor Permanent Facilitator, it is considered offboarded and its budgets revoked.  Edge Cases  Several edge cases are detailed in the MIP that I believe covers the most likely scenarios. Governance Facilitators are explicitly empowered to resolve edge cases that were not anticipated.  General Note on Governance Involvement  This change reduces the input Maker Governance has over Interim Facilitator selection in favor of speed and maintaining continuity. Empowering the existing Facilitators in this way should be safe given:  The power Maker Governance exercises over funds. A majority of Facilitators are honest actors. Interim Appointments are time-limited.

This subproposal amends MIP41: Facilitator Framework. Specifically, it adds MIP41c7: Interim Facilitator Appointment Process and amends the following components:  MIP41c3: Governance Facilitator Governance Powers MIP41c6: Interim Facilitators and the Fallback Decision Process   This subproposal modifies the nomination process for the Interim Facilitator. It reduces Maker Governance input in the Interim Facilitator appointment process in order to increase speed and maintain Core Unit continuity. The nomination process is as follows:  Faciliatators who are voluntarily offboarded may nominate their own successor without any Governance input. Core Units may override that choice by voting for an Interim Facilitator candidate within 72 hours. Each Core Unit has one vote and a simple majority is used to decide the winner. Should the above process fail, this subproposal allows for the submission of expedited MIP41c4 subproposals to appoint new permanent Facilitators.   This subproposal limits the number of Interim Facilitators to one, sets a two-month term limit for Interim Facilitators, and explicitly defines their compensation. The subproposal considers a number of likely edge cases and how to handle them. Governance Facilitators are explicitly empowered to resolve any other edge cases that may occur. This proposal has been assigned High-Impact based on the methodology listed here.  Disclaimer: These summaries are intended to be a guide and not a source of truth.

I think I might be misunderstanding what you mean by \u2018tyrant\u2019 here. But assuming you mean something along the lines of \u2018malicious dictator\u2019 I think:  First that it\u2019s unlikely that a tyrant would end up in the position, given that that would imply they\u2019d been misjudged by a majority of existing core unit facilitators. If you\u2019re assuming a majority of core unit facilitators are malicious, then you\u2019re already screwed. Second, I don\u2019t think changing the remuneration would impact the outcome if a tyrant was elected and gained control over a portion of the core unit funds (likely to be in excess of 30k.)  I would also say that I viewed 15k as a lower fall-back option in comparison to the facilitator remuneration in the case the remuneration wasn\u2019t public. I would guess that most facilitators are paid in excess of 180k DAI per year. So in conclusion, maybe? I don\u2019t think the change is worth the added complexity, but if others are in support of it, I can work it in. ",

I understand there is a 2 month limit but still there is no encourage for the interim person to leave.   Just to address this, I think this case is covered?  If a permanent Facilitator has not been chosen before the expiry of an Interim Facilitator\u2019s two-month term, the Core Unit is offboarded, and any budgets are revoked. A majority of Governance Facilitators may extend this time limit by stating publicly that they are doing so, and the reasoning for this decision.   If a new permanent Facilitator is onboarded to the relevant Core Unit through a MIP41c4 subproposal the Interim Facilitator is immediately offboarded and all powers and responsibilities are transferred to the new permanent Facilitator.  (both from the actual MIP text, rather than the summary here in the amendment) Basically, if they refuse to step down, then they stop getting access to any budget, and the DAO ceases to recognize them as the facilitator. There\u2019s not really much else you can do when someone refuses to leave their position and has access to budget funds. That\u2019s why budget funds are generally:  Streamed rather than transferred in one lump Controlled by at least a 2-of-2 multi-sig  ",
