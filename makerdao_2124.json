Comments  Accommodation for Recognized Delegate Contract Migration Per MIP61c4 when Recognized Delegates are involved in a contract migration there is a 30-day window where the amount of MKR delegated to their old and new contract is counted for the purposes of compensation in order to provide stability for Recognized Delegates.  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Recognized Delegates\u2019 MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with for compensation calculations is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Calculations MIP 61 was ratified during the March 2022 Governance Cycle. This MIP contains details of the calculations used to determine Recognized Delegate compensation as well as information about the Performance Modifier. MIP4c2-SP24 passed in the September Governance Cycle. This has amended MIP61 to use a 120-day rolling window for calculation of delegation metrics. MIP4c2-SP29 passed in the January Governance Cycle. This introduces an Abstain Modifier and modifies weighting for Executive Votes by a factor of 5.  Distribution Recognized Delegate compensation will be distributed as part of the next Executive Vote, scheduled for 2023-02-08.

Credits Huge thanks to @piotr.klis from the Data Insights CU for fetching the raw data, updating the feed to account for delegate contract migration, and generally putting up with GovAlpha\u2019s neediness.  Comments  Accommodation for Recognized Delegate Contract Migration Per MIP61c4 when Recognized Delegates are involved in a contract migration there is a 30-day window where the amount of MKR delegated to their old and new contract is counted for the purposes of compensation in order to provide stability for Recognized Delegates.  Calculations around starting / leaving delegates  Recognized Delegates\u2019 MKR weight is measured once per day, and this is used to generate an average for the month. The amount of MKR Recognized Delegates are credited with for compensation calculations is an average of the days for which they were active for the month. The average referenced in the previous point counts MKR delegated on each day to a maximum of 10,000 MKR in line with the intention to cap the benefit from delegated MKR at the upper threshold of 10,000 MKR. We apply pro-rata scaling to compensation for Recognized Delegates that were only active for a part of the month.   Recognized Delegate Compensation Calculations MIP 61 was ratified during the March 2022 Governance Cycle. This MIP contains details of the calculations used to determine Recognized Delegate compensation as well as information about the Performance Modifier. MIP4c2-SP24 passed in the September Governance Cycle. This has amended MIP61 to use a 120-day rolling window for calculation of delegation metrics. MIP4c2-SP29 passed in the January Governance Cycle. This introduces an Abstain Modifier and modifies weighting for Executive Votes by a factor of 5.  Distribution Recognized Delegate compensation will be distributed as part of the next Executive Vote, scheduled for 2023-03-08.
