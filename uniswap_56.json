                    "content": " rekt on \u201cimpermanent loss\u201d  You don\u2019t loose money with IL, it\u2019s money that you could have won but you havn\u2019t. Pratically, let\u2019s compare multiple strategy starting with 1k$ in the USDC / ETH pair and then price of ETH doubles :  If you would have hodled 1k USDC instead you would have 1k$ If you would have pooled thoses tokens into the pair, you would have 1k5$ And if you would have hodled ETH you would have 2k$  What is important to realise is that this is too late. You will never win the 500$ you are missing right now. To have that money you would have needed to hodl ETH (which you havn\u2019t). If your IL goes back down, you might think this would be a good thing, while it wouldn\u2019t, if IL goes back down this means that you will become poorer (simply ETH returning to the previous price), so you would have 1k$ back again, it\u2019s just that someone that hodled ETH would have 1k$ too. (I\u2019m ignoring the case where USDC value raises, for me only ETH can fall to reduce the IL) IL isn\u2019t an objective mesure nor usefull metrics and I don\u2019t think you should base your strategy on this.

This perspective really misses something. Consider the question: Was the decision to deposit into the USDC-WETH pool a good decision? Obviously, it wasn\u2019t. Considered as an isolated, single decision, deciding to deposit was not a good decision. This matters because every prospective LP has to make this decision. ",
