                    "content": "The recent P1-DROP proposal have shown that it is hard to lend against real-world stable assets, have liquidity, short duration risk, and a good yield. This post is a way to discuss longer maturity investments and poll the community about it. With the current rate environment (0.3% on the 12-month LIBOR rate), it is difficult to generate yield without going too low in the credit quality ladder. A short term junk bonds ETF, SHYG, can only offer 3.6% for a 24-month average maturity. We might find some niche assets (trade finance, fix&flip real estate) that provide a good enough yield, but it will not work for more common assets. One option is to move to longer-term financing. This would be reducing liquidity (at least at par price) and increasing the duration risk. Let\u2019s explore some consequences:   Illiquidity when DAI demand increases: We don\u2019t really need to close the vault if the demand for DAI is steady. DAI may break the peg again, but as the borrower doesn\u2019t have to repay and we sure don\u2019t want him to, all is fine.  Illiquidity when DAI demand decreases. If DAI demand decreases, we want to reduce our loan exposure to diminish the amount of DAI outside. Nevertheless, if DAI depegs on the lower side, the borrower, being exposed in $, has now incentive to repay by refinancing elsewhere.  Real-world interest rates falling: If rates continue to drop, it is likely that vault owners will refinance elsewhere and close the vault. I don\u2019t think this is an issue for us at this stage.  Real-world interest rates increasing: In this case, we will have an opportunity cost as having short duration loans would allow us to lend at a higher rate.  DSR rates increasing: In such a case, we might have to pay more on the liability side than what we get on the asset side. Currently, we are hoarding a lot of USDC that yields 0% so it would still be better. Nevertheless, it\u2019s easier to dispose of USDC than loans.  Collateral value decreasing: Many yield-generating assets (like farms, real estate, \u2026) have an inverse correlation with interest rates because the value of the asset is more or less using discounted cash flows (and the discounting parameter matters). I would suggest that what really matters here is the servicing of the loan (i.e., ongoing monthly payments). We might still have the ability to sell if covenants are breached, but that would come at a cost (this will not be black & white and will depend on each collateral).  We have already some asset originators asking us what we are looking for as loan maturity. I would say that committing up to 10% of our assets ($130M) on longer maturity loans would make sense. It is unlikely that we should decrease DAI supply by more than 90% (at least that would be painful in any case). If we stick with a short maturity constraint, we might either have to accept opportunities with low stability fees (something like 2%) and/or higher credit risk. As it might not be acceptable, it might therefore limit our RWA exposure due to the lack of suitable opportunities. Therefore, do you agree on longer maturity loans?     yes, I agree with longer maturity loans no, I want to keep loans below 24 months maturity abstain     0 voters     What would be the minimum stability fees that you would accept for a RWA collateral:     0% 1% 2% 3% 4% Higher Abstain     0 voters     If you agree on longer terms, what would be the maximum duration: you would accept:     let\u2019s keep it to 24 months (2 years) 5 years 10 years 20 years 30 years abstain     0 voters     Those polls will help the RWA team informing prospects on the terms to be provided in the MIP6 application.

I don\u2019t quite see RWA as equivalent to T-Bills - so lets just get past that. I thought SF was supposed to be related to generating revenue against risk/loss profiles.   The real question becomes what are competitive rates and terms.   My understanding here is that time frames on these loans are short term - no more than 2-3 years.  The point is that DROP basically cycles its invoices within this time frame, and my understanding of 6s is that their projects are expected to complete within 24 months. I don\u2019t have a clear handle on risk nor how rates and time frames are determined in the industry generally.   My guess here is that rates are in the 2-4% range and time frames in the 2-3 year ranges depending on the credit quality of the borrower and the risk profiles of the industry.    One has to look at the business these people are in and what this cash allows them to do.  (i.e. what is their profit model on the cash they are being loaned).   Typically in the two cases we are looking at returns run in the 8-10% range and so depending on their borrow they end up with about a 100-250% profit overhead on the cash they can borrow.   Having a long term facility (i.e. a facility that doesn\u2019t need to be renewed every so many years) is also an expense and headache plus. I think it is important to have a long term facility but I don\u2019t see the point here of having a term facility since we give DC or not and basically set the SF.   If I am going to lean in a direction here it is NOT to have a term and simply to set a reasonably competitive rate.   The best way to do this is to start high on SF and see how much DC our RWAs take (start around 4%)  if they don\u2019t touch it we can just lower it until they do.   Personally I really would like our RWAs borrowers suggest what they would like to see here and then adjust accordingly. The whole problem here is going to be rate setting btw.  The second problem is going to be collateral price oracles and deciding whether risk has grown so SF needs to be raised (to encourage a risky RWA to close) and/or to liquidate.    Lastly managing DC since DC basically doesn\u2019t go down unless a vault/borrower pays down a loan. I think throwing out this as a poll without any comments or feedback from our RWA players though is disingenous to Maker governance as allowing this \u2018freedom\u2019 of choice implies there \u2018is\u2019 freedom and I would hazard our RWA players would suggest 6-8% is too high, and governance risk would suggest .25-.5% too low on the SF side.

They are willing to take a TIN tranche of 20% and gives us the remaining DROP tranche for a 3% yield. Let\u2019s assume this makes sense from a risk perspective. Obviously, the 3% SF needs to be fixed for 5 years. Otherwise, this doesn\u2019t work. The same thing for a real-estate portfolio (non-construction), no one will be interested in a Maker Vault if we can change the stability fees every week up to 100%. They will need to have the ability to liquidate (or refinance). That will come at a cost and it will be paid by Maker. Having quick liquidity without any loss on something that is not liquid is not easy. My point is that I don\u2019t think we really need liquidity and we can commit to a term loan (i.e. a vault with a fixed SF for a defined time). This is why we have 2 collaterals that are construction loans. I would personally sleep better with rented mature real estate in which the rent cover way above the stability fees and will repay the loan in the next 10-20 years. The intent of the poll is to get your feeling about this question. We can stick with short terms loans. But wanting the safety of yield-earning long term assets with the near-instant liquidity at no loss is not possible. ",

                    "content": "Good poll @SebVentures \u2026 Here is my feedback:   I like the concept of long term, but I wouldn\u2019t want this to be conflated with fixed stability fees. I know this isn\u2019t what you were saying, but I feel like it\u2019s worth specifying. We\u2019d be putting ourselves in a tight corner if we ever offered a fixed stability fee. I don\u2019t think we should ever do fixed stability fees.   I think those voting for 1% are dreaming too small. There\u2019s plenty of high quality yield out there if the community is willing to put in the work. The Prime Rate is 3% over LIBOR, so at the very least we should be targeting that as a floor until we\u2019ve reached a scale where we can\u2019t.   Going back to my first point, I think duration is irrelevant so long as the stability fee remains variable. If we need the borrower to close the Vault, we can use this lever. If they refuse to close and go below their mutually agreed ratios, the assets will be liquidated.   Of course, this all requires proper structuring to ensure that our levers actually function. ",

If we need the borrower to close the Vault, we can use this lever. If they refuse to close and go below their mutually agreed ratios, the assets will be liquidated.   There is a link between duration and interest rate, at least in Maker. Vaults are by default long term and no prepayment penalty. Indeed, if you can set stability fees at 1000% you are no longer lending long term but weekly with a roll-over. My perspective is that we should lend only when we know it\u2019s profitable for both parties. Otherwise, you attract only borrowers that have no other choices. This would be the worst thing to do.

                    "content": "I think you make a good point. The rates in crypto are still significantly higher than in the regular financial market and the market immaturity of crypto is probably the main reason for this. This means a lot of borrowers in the real world are able to get better interest rates and thus are not interested in competing with crypto-borrowers for collateral. However I do believe there are two reasons we shouldn\u2019t wait for rates in crypto to go down overall before we look into real world assets: Long tail lending In traditional finance, rates for asset classes like mortgages and large commodities profit from very low rates. But if you look into smaller asset classes it\u2019s a very different story. These are not well understood by banks and thus they don\u2019t have access to the same cost of capital. Of course they are also higher risk but I think that\u2019s still nothing compared to the risk that we are used to in crypto. These assets can be the beach head we use to onboard traditional finance. Diversification of Collateral We\u2019re in a bull market and the price of DAI is stable so this is probably falling into the background for a lot of people. But I think we often forget & underestimate the damage DAI going off the peg has done to the status of DAI as the defacto DeFi USD stablecoin. Adding collateral that is uncorrelated to crypto will help in making the supply of DAI more stable in crazy market fluctuations which can only help in keeping the DAI peg. Even if we are giving long term stable assets DAI at a cost far lower than what crypto collateral pays the benefit they bring here probably outweighs the missed revenue or even potential subsidy over the DSR.

This cuts out anyone from this that doesn\u2019t use extremely liquid collateral or has a very easy alternative source of capital. And the problem is that for people who have these alternative sources it\u2019s very unlikely that Maker can beat the terms they have once you factor in fiat on/off ramp costs (likely around %0.1) and DAI volatility risk.
