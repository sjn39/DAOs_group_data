                    "content": "@Ethernian Great question. If one were to use separate tokens to model the different classes, external calls would have to be made. For non-trivial dapps that require maintenance of state in internal variables of the contract, this would result in having to write many getter/setter methods which is cumbersome and expensive to call. E.g. imagine modeling the conversion of restricted stock in a company to common stock. It would be much easier to write the logic for this if the tokens for these classes were in the same contract.
