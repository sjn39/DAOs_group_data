                    "content": "So we\u2019ve been recently been discussing the possibility of uniswap liquidity tokens as collateral again in this thread . The uniswap v2 pools now have much more liquidity than v1 pools, and so I think it\u2019s time to have an updated application here. Here are more related threads: v1 collateral discussion v1 collateral application(v2 app is mostly copied from here): Reasons to include the Eth-Dai liquidity token Personally, I think the Eth-Dai token would make good collateral for the following reasons:  Being able to use it for collateral incentivises the uniswap-v2 ETH-DAI pool, this is beneficial as it allows people to trade Eth-Dai with less slippage. It is more valuable to hold when ETH is trading sideways rather than upward or downward. This makes it more likely actors will wish to use it for leverage when they expect no major change in Eth price. It is the 3rd largest liquidity pool of the uniswap liquidity pools at just over 10 million dollars worth of assets. We may also consider adding the eth-usdc token which is the 2nd largest with over 13 million dollars in assets. More uniswap pool info here  potential as a tool to improve the peg if the protocol opens a vault, allowing us to inject dai liquidity directly into the market by holding uniswap tokens, while providing much desired yield to mkr holders. This also mitigates the issue brought up previously of uniswap tokens having insignificant impact on dai supply.  Application Form 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @befitsandpiper 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Uniswap is a decentralized Constant Product Market Maker that operates on-chain. Unlike v1, there is a possibility of governance in the future that will allow upgrading of the profile. There are three user groups, the first: traders use uniswap to swap one crypto-asset for another. The second: liquidity providers who provide liquidity for traders in exchange for a small fee on every trade. The third: a hypothetical future DAO to manage and upgrade the protocol. As far as I can tell this DAO and associated governance tokens have not been released yet, and I have not been able to find much information on it. See https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/ for more details. 3. Provide a brief history of the project I\u2019m going to leave this for someone else to provide. I\u2019m not 100% sure how relevant it is for this particular collateral type and I suspect that most people are aware of uniswap. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. High level explainer of v2 vs v1: https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/ Whitepaper: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf Docs: https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/ Code: https://github.com/Uniswap 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Audit report: https://uniswap.org/audit.html 6. Link to any active communities relating to the project. Discord: https://discord.com/invite/XErMcTq Blog: https://uniswap.org/blog/ 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? To the best of my knowledge the uniswap liquidity tokens are not used by any other protocols directly. There are a number of dashboards that display the amount available, and some apps for calculating profit, but otherwise these appear to be a largely untapped resource. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No organisation bears legal responsibility for the collateral. Dai, Eth and the uniswap tokens are all permissionless. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? I am not aware of any markets for the ETH-DAI uniswap liquidity tokens outside of uniswap itself. Uniswap allows redemption between liquidity tokens and the underlying assets at any time. By definition, there is always the required liquidity for this redemption. 10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has the project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. No 11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. No 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Not sure. I suspect the best way to go about this is to have oracles report the prices for the underlying assets and then get the ratio from the uniswap contract. Uniswap does have an oracle system discussed here: https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/. I\u2019ll leave it up to the Oracle Domain team to decide if we want to use the uniswap oracle for the token price. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. No parties that I know of, though I suspect that anyone willing to bid on ETH collateral would also be willing to bid on ETH-DAI liquidity tokens. ",

A keeper gets back roughly 1/2 the value in DAI when they liquidate requiring no other tx other than a deposit to return to making bids. A reduced pricing risk in ETH.

No need for new oracles.  I am a yes to this one.    Depending on the LR I would not expect this to mint much DAI but anything to help incentivize DAI minting as well as putting additional liquidity in uniswap is a good idea generally. I think a general consideration for all the uniswap-DAI tokens that represent already in place Maker collateral (KNC-DAI, ZRX-DAI, BAT-DAI, USDC-DAI, etc.) should also be considered at some point because no new oracles are needed and keepers already know how to deal with these (all except USDC at this point - soon to change). There is only one negative and that is the number of tx\u2019s required to fully cycle collateral for a keeper is up because to get the ETH and DAI one has to redeem the uniswap, and then sell the ETH where as ETH alone only requires a ETH sale.

I suspect the best way to go about this is to have oracles report the prices for the underlying assets and then get the ratio from the uniswap contract.   The best thing to do is definitely to have oracles report prices for both underlying assets. To calculate the underlying value of some amount of liquidity tokens at a given instant, you would naively do token0Amount = reserveToken0*liquidityAmount/liquidityTotalSupply token1Amount = reserveToken1*liquidityAmount/liquidityTotalSupply totalValue=token0Amount*oraclePrice0 + token1Amount*oraclePrice1  However, if the price of Uniswap is off at that moment, the value will be calculated higher than it should because liquidity tokens values are at their lowest in a fully arb\u2019d state. So the oracle should instead calculate what reserveToken0 and reserveToken1 would in after an arbitrage trade that brings it to the price ratio reported by the Maker oracles for the underlying assets.  I can share this formula if helpful (shouldn\u2019t be too hard to calculate on chain). Then calculate fully arbitraged value: token0Amount = arbitragedReserveToken0*liquidityAmount/liquidityTotalSupply token1Amount = arbitragedReserveToken1*liquidityAmount/liquidityTotalSupply totalValue=token0Amount*oraclePrice0 + token1Amount*oraclePrice1  This gives you a safe floor price to use when pricing liquidity tokens.

How would it work in an emergency shutdown? Maker would have to convert all the liquidity pool tokens first before allowing any DAI holder access to their ETH claim, return collateral ETH and DAI to the vault holders, dump whatever ETH is left over into the pool that DAI holders have a claim to, and burn any remaining left over DAI. Actually, doing that seems less risky than a normal vault for everybody concerned. But, I think it is a big change. Edit: I mean otherwise during a shutdown, the DAI holder gets claim to collateral, which includes LP token, which breaks down into DAI which is a clam to collateral, etc. ",

The uniswap v2 pools now have much more liquidity than v1 pools, and so I think it\u2019s time to have an updated application here. Here are more related threads: v1 collateral discussion v1 collateral application(v2 app is mostly copied from here): Reasons to include the Eth-Usdc liquidity token Personally, I think the Eth-Usdc token would make good collateral for the following reasons:  Being able to use it for collateral incentivises the uniswap-v2 ETH-Usdc pool, this is beneficial as it allows people to trade Eth-Usdc with less slippage. It is more valuable to hold when ETH is trading sideways rather than upward or downward. This makes it more likely actors will wish to use it for leverage when they expect no major change in Eth price. It is the 2nd largest liquidity pool of the uniswap liquidity pools at just over 13 million dollars worth of assets. More uniswap pool info here   Application Form 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @befitsandpiper 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Uniswap is a decentralized Constant Product Market Maker that operates on-chain. Unlike v1, there is a possibility of governance in the future that will allow upgrading of the profile. There are three user groups, the first: traders use uniswap to swap one crypto-asset for another. The second: liquidity providers who provide liquidity for traders in exchange for a small fee on every trade. The third: a hypothetical future DAO to manage and upgrade the protocol. As far as I can tell this DAO and associated governance tokens have not been released yet, and I have not been able to find much information on it. See https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/ for more details. 3. Provide a brief history of the project I\u2019m going to leave this for someone else to provide. I\u2019m not 100% sure how relevant it is for this particular collateral type and I suspect that most people are aware of uniswap. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. High level explainer of v2 vs v1: https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/ Whitepaper: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf Docs: https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/ Code: https://github.com/Uniswap 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Audit report: https://uniswap.org/audit.html 6. Link to any active communities relating to the project. Discord: https://discord.com/invite/XErMcTq Blog: https://uniswap.org/blog/ 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? To the best of my knowledge the uniswap liquidity tokens are not used by any other protocols directly. There are a number of dashboards that display the amount available, and some apps for calculating profit, but otherwise these appear to be a largely untapped resource. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No organisation bears legal responsibility for the collateral. Dai, Eth and the uniswap tokens are all permissionless. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? I am not aware of any markets for the ETH-DAI uniswap liquidity tokens outside of uniswap itself. Uniswap allows redemption between liquidity tokens and the underlying assets at any time. By definition, there is always the required liquidity for this redemption. 10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has the project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. No 11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. No 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Not sure. I suspect the best way to go about this is to have oracles report the prices for the underlying assets and then get the ratio from the uniswap contract. Uniswap does have an oracle system discusses here: https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/ but this probably is still too risky to query directly. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. No parties that I know of, though I suspect that anyone willing to bid on ETH collateral would also be willing to bid on ETH-DAI liquidity tokens. ",
