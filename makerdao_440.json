                    "content": "Hi there, Last time I saw the People of Maker in Paris at EthCC-2021 I was once more confirmed how valuable it is to really meet in person and not only through zoom and chat. The next opportunity for repeating this would be EthDenver in February. Besides the personal desire of mingling again with the Maker Community, I guess it would be helpful for us if we get some Recognized Delegates into this event as well - e.g. be part of intros and meetings @Growth-Core-Unit is there. I am totally fine with taking some time off from my off-chain work to do that (thanks delegate-compensation!), but there is no such thing as a travel budget for this. I just got my confirmation for the ticket to EthDenver - so now I am looking for a Core Unit that would like to sponsor my travel expenses for this field trip. Of course in the case somebody wants to do that, I will completely submit myself to their mission - this is not a sponsored \u201cschuppi is going to hack\u201d event. Cheers Tim ",

Because of COVID, it has been difficult for various Growth team members to get a visa for the US, reducing the number of people that were supposed to go. For Growth, these conferences are fundamental to meeting with people, which increases our pipeline and helps us to reduce the lifetime of our deals. Our experience with @flipflopflapdelegate in Lisbon as the Maker evangelist was terrific. He helped us a lot, putting us in touch with various projects and talking about Maker with different people. To make it fair, if there\u2019s another conference and something similar happens, we are open to sponsoring another delegate to help us get new leads and grow Maker. ",
