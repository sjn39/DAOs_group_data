                    "content": "Always loved your work @makerburn One thing I have been wanting to see was total DAI earned by the protocol over time as a graph.   I want this number before any MKR burn, withdrawals, etc.    Then if you are so inclined to the the first graph I\u2019d love to be able to break this chart down into: Total DAI earned Protocol costs Maker burned (in DAI ofc) and anything else that pulls from the total DAI earned or adds to it (like flopping MKR after Black Thursday) Once you have this in DAI it would be very interesting to see the expenses as a % of DAI earned and ofc a P/R and P/E chart and these revenues as a % relative to total DAI in existence. Of note will be the hit which should be a drop in this chart due to Black Thursday and the increase in DAI due to MKR being sold. (the hit was a real DAI loss to the protocol and the MKR sold to make up for it a real DAI net in). The whole point of the above is to track DAI income from all sources against DAI outflows to all sinks and then to look at this both from a Market cap perspective %, as well as a DAI outstanding % I had one single question I simply couldn\u2019t answer easily.   How much DAI has the MCD protocol made since inception, and how much DAI has been spent and then to see this as something like a chart over time. I expect the above will take some time but I think such data above has important business metrics that are very much needed when doing business analysis.  This will be particularly true going forward. ",
