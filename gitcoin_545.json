                    "content": "Hello DAOfrens, This is request for someone to come up with a new decentralized experience for creating Gitcoin-style avatars. As we progressively decentralize Gitcoin, the Gitcoin Holdings company is interested in decentralizing the avatar builder. We build the avatar builder so that users could celebrate their uniqueness and have a cool way of showing off their individuality on the site.  As We also feel that there was a missed oipportunity here to leverage our art assets to ride the PFP boom, and perhaps fund public goods with the ETH received. An ideal candidate would be have the following principles:  Simplicity - products that do ONE THING and do it WELL. Antifragility - Well-documented Decentralized products that our community can run without the centralized company. Modularity - products that easily unix-style interoperate with each other.  An ideal proposal would  (at a minimum) 1:1 replicate the centralized experience at https://gitcoin.co/onboard/profile?steps=avatar but store the code/avatars in a decentralize way. (at a maximum) create a new novel way to make these avatar\u2019s into PFPs and fund public goods with them.  Please include  Who are you What is your proposal to build this What is your timeline to build this What do you need (funding, etc)  Please submit your proposal as a comment on the gov forum thread.

                    "content": " Who Are You Heyo @owocki and fellow Gitcoiners! I\u2019m Paul Gadi, co-founder and CTO at OPGames. We\u2019re bridging game developers to Web 3.0 by building the open-source tools to make it as simple as possible for them to start integrating with the blockchain. We\u2019re calling these tools Game Legos: in the same way that Money Legos was able to bring about the DeFi renaissance, we feel these Game Legos will be instrumental in bringing about the coming NFT Game revolution. Game Legos are also perfectly in sync with the goals of this RFP. We\u2019re building them open-source and as simple, robust, and composable as we can.  What Is Your Proposal to Build This OPGames has already started building an open-source PFP creator over at GitHub - alto-io/game-legos at avatar  image1473\u00d7904 115 KB  We\u2019ve been building it on top of @austingriffith\u2019s scaffold-eth. We believe Scaffold-eth is not only the framework with the most solid foundation but is also the fastest way for developers to get started in Web 3.0. It also has a strong community of builders behind it that we could tap to continue improving the project. We\u2019ve used some of the scaffold-eth code already to achieve some of the requirements in the RFP. It already stores the avatars in a decentralized manner via IPFS, and uses the example smart contracts to mint them as NFTs.  What Is Your Timeline To Build This A lot of the initial effort will be migrating over the frontend to scaffold-eth. After that we\u2019ll integrate the PFP generation with the NFT minting contracts. Finally, properly documenting the project would also take some time. An estimate would be 1 to 1.5 months, depending on the code complexity.  What Do You Need  Being able to consult with the original developer of the frontend would be great, so we can more easily address any issues with migrating over the code and also write solid documentation OPGames can assign a team of developers on it for 5 ETH to build the initial version We\u2019d be interested in collaborating and exploring how to make the project sustainable even after the RFP. Perhaps we can build a DAO where all projects using it would donate a portion of their PFP sale to the DAO?  Thanks for reading, we\u2019re open to suggestions and comments! ",
