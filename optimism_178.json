                    "content": "As of now, OPerating manual does not have any guideline on handling conflict of interest and I want to hear your opinion on this. Challenge:-  Lets say a project feels that an entity is voting against their proposal or giving someone a favor for some reason.   They can raise their voice but once voting is done, no one can do anything and foundation will act on the final result.   What if some one feels that I am acting and voting unethically.   Again, we dont have any thing in OPerating manual on how to handle this.   What to do if I see bias   I would appreciate if we can discuss this on this forum but what if other party is not willing to listen.   Suggestion:- Create a committee to handle such scenario, we can reach out to this committee with these type request and their decision would be final. Who Would be on this committee:-  Person/Team raising the request will choose 2 person* Other party involved, if chooses to, can also choose 2 person   One delegate(for simplicity we will keep any delegate with 0.5% voting power) and one OP Citizen  How I see it in work:-  3 out of 4 vote is needed to reach final decision. Keeping it small will help the committee would be trivial at initial steps It is MANDATORY to have OP Citizen in this committee.   Challenge:- Generally, I am not a big fan of creating many committee as I believe this makes things complicated and increase bureaucracy. But as we are doing and learning things iteratively, I am in favor of this. We should try and see how things works out, if not needed, we can decommission this committee. Happy to hear your thoughts on this. Edit:-1 Adding some context with an example. I submitted a proposal and was voted by Token House but I am not happy with how X entity has voted on my proposal. So, here i will invoke the Conflict committee and submit my case. Token house is and will be deciding pillar, what will change, if the Conflict committee approve my request, only vote of X will be removed from the final result. Votes and result from rest of the Token will still apply. We are not over-riding Token house, we are just removing conflict. ",

Here, Bob will submit a conflict of interest report in front of this committee including all the evidence supporting his side, ofcourse Alice will do the same too. Then, this committee will hear both side of story and take a decision. Why a Delegate, I think they are involved this our gov process from start and they might the right person to for this task.  OP Citinzenship is \u201clive\u201d we could have someone from OP Foundation in the committee  This is tricky thought, Including someone from foundation will complicate things, main goal of this suggestion is to remove Bais and we dont want someone calling foundation Bias because of their decision. My goal would be to keep the foundation from gov as far as possible. We should resolve things internally, they have the Veto power anyway so if we act on something complex or critical, they can Veto it. ",

And if this committee decides to cancel the votes then the Optimism Foundation does not have to execute the Token House decision just from the committee vote (3 people). My opinion: It is Token House (the decisive part), decentralized, and if we emphasize that Token House consists of many parties then 1-2 parties do not have the majority vote and do not decide the final result. And if we mention that projects still have to have voting power in the Optimism Collective then there can be certain conflicts, and for such cases rules can be set in the OPerating Manual proposed by the Token House, (without the need for a committee).

Yes, it might happen that removing a single person can change the final decision, but then I would say we have failed as gov where removal of single person is changing the end result.  And if someone will initiate this committee and excluding one party\u2019s vote won\u2019t change the final result of the vote, then it makes no sense   Any committee cannot be initiated by conflicting parties, because there will always be conflicting interests, and the decision will not be objective, the committee must be created from neutral parties.  Both valid point and I wanted to talk more on this once there was enough interest( including you and others) in this proposal but here we go. Why would you do this if removing one person does not have impact on final decision, well simply because it makes process transparent. Lets take this one step ahead. On the basis of engagement give everyone involved a Dynamic NFT, if my request goes in favor(approved by Conflict council) then change the NFT (some kind of point system) and deduct the point from loosing side. This will help us counter unnecessary request towards CC. What if an individual user chooses so do so, assuming they can create many account on forum just to raise a request Anyone who wants to create such request need approval from a delegate with 0.5% voting power, same as we are doing for GF proposal. A user can create multiple identity, a delegate could not. S/he/they will also only support request that has valid and actual evidence. This will also help with unnecessary request. Just to clarify, here if users request was denied by CC, the delegate who sponsored the request will losse the point.  Repeat the same process for multiple round and you have a digital on-chain identity, you can use that to show your credibility. In long run this could help us with DAO-to-DAO gov. What you say ? are we making any progress here ? ",

Creating an additional arbitrator that could void the will of the Token House just feels like its not aligned with the OP vision, despite it having some benefits in specific situations. My counsel would be to build cultural norms of delegates abstaining when there is any semblance of conflict of interest.
