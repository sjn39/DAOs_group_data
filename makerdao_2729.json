                    "content": "Introduction In the past couple of weeks, given the community\u2019s feedback on the collateral onboarding process, the mandated actors have discussed taking a more flexible approach to collateral onboarding. This forum post is a call-to-action to improve the Collateral Onboarding process by increasing the Collateral Onboarding process\u2019s flexibility, efficiency, and agility. In general, the Collateral Onboarding Framework\u2019s goal is to provide an end-to-end framework for scalable collateral onboarding that interoperates with the Governance Cycle, the community, and the existing Domain Teams. Over the past few months, the mandated actors and Maker community have learned quite a lot about what is working well and what could be improved with respect to governance processes and, in this case, collateral onboarding. Additionally, with the fast-moving nature of the space and the massive demand for DAI, allowing the collateral onboarding process to take place in a less restrained way will ultimately benefit MakerDAO. Thus, it has become apparent to the mandated MakerDAO actors that Collateral Onboarding would be much more efficient and impactful if it were to transition to using the weekly governance cycle for Collateral Onboarding. Main Considerations Below are some of the primary considerations as to why the weekly cycle is the best fit for Collateral Onboarding to the Maker Protocol today:  Agility to reprioritize and add collateral assets every week as there are no strict deadlines for domain teams. Improve the efficiency of the collateral onboarding process. Improve the transparency of the collateral onboarding process. Increase the community\u2019s involvement in the onboarding process and help to distribute knowledge better (explained further in a below section).  Additionally, while some of the collateral onboarding MIPs have worked well for us, others have not. For example, MIP6 Applications have been a success, as have collateral Community Greenlight polls (MIP9). However, the other collateral onboarding MIPs have resulted in delays and frustration for all stakeholders. The Current Collateral Onboarding Process To further provide evidence as to how this new process provides more flexibility, efficiency, and agility, below is an overview of the current collateral onboarding process:   A MIP6 application is posted to the MakerDAO forums.   A MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll is published.   After two weeks of the application being on the forums, a Community Greenlight poll (defined in MIP9) will be published and will last for two weeks. This is when community members can signal their interest in collateral types to the domain teams who will ultimately decide if the collateral asset should be onboarded to the Maker Protocol.   While domain teams are free to choose their workload, an on-chain governance poll provides the Domain Teams key insights into the community\u2019s sentiment for each collateral type that has been proposed. In addition to this, it is important to gather the opinion of MKR Token Holders towards the proposed collateral asset before the full domain work takes place. This helps prevent work from being wasted on undesirable collateral types.   MIP8: Domain Greenlight (This stage currently does not happen in the current process)   In this stage, the domain teams will signal that they believe the collateral type is worth the time to perform a full evaluation in their respective domain. Note that this stage may happen in parallel to the MIP6 process, but communication from the Domain teams should always come within two weeks of the end of the allotted review time for MIP6\u2019s collateral onboarding form/forum publication.   MIP11: Collateral Onboarding Risk Models (This process is not currently used in the regular collateral onboarding process)   This process is only required if a new General Risk Model needs onboarding or a General Risk Model needs offboarding.   MIP12: Collateral Onboarding and Risk Parameter Adjustment Process Documentation Requirements   Using MIP12c2: Subproposal for proposing new Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters, the Smart contracts team, Risk team, and oracles team will propose their work assessments. This proposal is then published during the Formal Submission period and can then enter the Monthly Cycle, which contains two polls and one final executive vote to determine if the collateral asset will be added to the Maker Protocol.   The Collateral Asset is added to the Maker Protocol.   Proposed Collateral Onboarding Process Details  A MIP6 application is proposed to the official MakerDAO forums. After two weeks of the application being on the forums, a MIP9 Community Greenlight poll will be published and will last for two weeks. Domain teams will use the public prioritization framework (details to follow) to determine which assets to onboard to the Maker Protocol. Domain collateral assessments will be published to the forums (as they are currently). A Governance Poll will be posted on Monday, containing the domain team assessments. If passed and if all the teams have completed the required work to onboard the collateral asset, it will go up for an Executive Vote on that Friday. If the Executive Vote passes, the collateral asset will be added to the Maker Protocol.  Introduction of a Collateral Onboarding Prioritization Framework The Domain Teams and other Mandated Actors are working on a public prioritization framework and collateral onboarding thesis. The prioritization framework will allow the Maker community to easily understand why certain assets are prioritized over others, reducing any confusion and increasing transparency as to why certain greenlight collateral assets have not been actively pursued yet despite being proposed months ago. It\u2019s also important to note that the framework may change over time based on the domain team\u2019s strategy and thesis. The prioritization framework is still in the works, but the general idea would be that the risk domain team and/or the governance facilitators will maintain a public list of collateral onboarding progress and plans. Opportunities for the Community (Grants!!) As mentioned during last week\u2019s Governance call, it\u2019s clear the domain teams and mandated actors have low bandwidth, and they need more contributors to step up and work on collateral onboarding. Given that the teams could use more support, whether by community members helping with collateral assessments or by forming new domain teams, there are grants available (here). With the introduction of the new process and the backlog of greenlit collateral assets, there are many opportunities for community members to get more involved in the Collateral onboarding process. Screen Shot 2020-09-18 at 11.35.48 AM1078\u00d71220 55.6 KB Such opportunities include but are not limited to:  Individuals can participate in any domain or area appropriate to their skillsets (Smart Contracts, Risk, Oracles, Legal, Project Management, Partnerships, Communications). Risk, Smart Contracts, Oracles collateral type assessments Smart Contracts and Oracle development work. Risk monitoring collateral assets once onboarded.  Providing Domain Knowledge Share for new Contributors Over the next few weeks, I plan to coordinate some more educational \u201cGetting started\u201d content for things such as:  How to propose a general and technical MIP (video walkthrough & guide) How to get started with writing SC, Risk, Oracle assessments (video walkthrough & guide) Executive Spell Guide And more!  In summary, with the new grants initiative being put in place, the domain teams will have more time to work on templates for assessments and create new tools to make the process more efficient and, at the same time, empower passionate community members to start getting practical experience running the DAO. If interested, please review the Collateral Onboarding Grants post (here) to learn more about the available opportunities! Next Steps In summary, the mandated actors are proposing the following changes:  Suspend the usage of MIPs 8, 10, 11, and 12 effective immediately. Explicitly allow collateral onboarding to be a flexible process that can adjust to the demands of reality. Publish and maintain a public document with all collateral types listed and prioritized according to their varying risks and benefits. Provide Foundation-funded grants for collateral onboarding to allow the community to take more of a role in this process.  In terms of the next steps, the mandated actors will be putting forward a signal request in the coming days to put these changes in place so that collateral onboarding can use the weekly cycle going forward. /Fin Lastly, I want to reiterate that since the Collateral Onboarding Framework was constructed via MIPs, which are established on the core principle of iterative improvements, the Collateral Onboarding Framework can be adjusted in both the near and long term. Therefore, this call-to-action should not be viewed as the end of the conversation concerning how the MakerDAO onboards collateral to the Maker Protocol, but rather the beginning of a new process that fits our current situation. To conclude this post, here is a quote from one of our awesome community members! \u201cWe ALL need to do our part and step-up! Recruit people, bring ideas to the table, without the dependency of the Maker Foundation. We need to recruit Devs, influencers, etc\u2026If you\u2019re an MKR holder and believe, let\u2019s unite and take the DAO to the next level.\u201d - @flipflopflapdelegate  ",
