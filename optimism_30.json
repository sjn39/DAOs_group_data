In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network\" I would like to counter the 0xJohn claims due to the following reasons. \u00b0 We really cant test the strength of $OP tokens if they all sit in the wallet without interractions with other dex and cex. \u00b0 $OP token needs a heavy marketcap that way it attracts investors and the attraction we actually need it to gain. This attraction helps to not only grow the $OP tokens but also creates awarenesses of the projects built within yhe optimism ecosystem \u00b0 Advanced interractions: Most users (from research so far) would probably have less funds to interract with other dexes within the optimisim ecosystem, and might deem it fit to also swap so that they get aquinted with other unused(uninterracted) projects living in the optimism ecosystem. \u00b0 In summary as a crypto evangelist I swore to help build and promote justice wherever the need be and by doing so I believe 0xJohn claims should be counted void since it would counter the decentralization which Optimism as a community tends to promote.

Perhaps it makes sense to give a slight reward for holding, but bear in mind many people are struggling financially and those who can afford to hold likely are not in that category. Also in many countries, airdrops are taxable events.  Someone could get theoretically punished financially if the token struggles to reach a decent price as they will have to pay taxes on the initial drop, but may not have any realized gains. As a first cycler, I am very happy to get my first optimism airdrop, but it\u2019s also a brutal Bear market with no end in sight. I have sold a little less than half of my airdrop, but kept all my funds on optimism. I think if the team is considering excluding sellers from future drops, they should prioritize people who moved their funds immediately off chain first. I am extremely excited to keep using Optimism especially now that I have real funds to participate with on chain. However, if Optimism takes a harsh stance against people who had to sell out of financial necessity, I will seriously rethink that position. ",

My thoughts are that those accounts that QUICKLY sold and then bridged out should be disqualified but accounts that sold to interact with the ecosystem i.e quests, liquidity etc\u2026 should qualify because these individuals are the core community. It really says a lot when a small account doesn\u2019t take an decent airdrop and run with it but keeps the liquidity within the ecosystem. Maybe setting a small threshold like keeping 10 OP to participate in gov would make sense but disqualifying sellers is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve seen on this forum and frankly if this happens it would set a scary standard.
