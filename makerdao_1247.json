                    "content": " [Urgent Signal Request] Set Aave D3M bar to 0%  Overview As a result of this post from @Primoz, Risk Core Unit (RISK-001) Facilitator, GovAlpha is submitting an urgent Signal Request as detailed in MIP24c4. This Signal Request asks Maker Governance if the Aave D3M bar should be set to 0. Setting the bar to 0 makes the target supply 0 as an added check on the D3M implementation. It is possible to set the bar to 0 using a MOM, this will bypass the GSM Pause Delay and allow any change to take effect on the execution of an Executive Vote. As it is an urgent Signal Request, it will last for 24 hours, and if successful, it will be followed by an expedited Executive Vote, which will contain only this proposal.  Rationale    [Signal Request] Set the AAVE D3M DC to 0 (Zero)   After today\u2019s proposal by Gauntlet  our team believes Maker should disable D3M for the time being. The proposed 90% liquidation threshold is a risky move, even though there\u2019s some rationale behind the proposal. The reason we believe this is risky is because out of 200m DAI borrowed on Aave Ethereum v2, 100m DAI is being borrowed by Celsius and collateralized mostly by stETH. Although the 90% liquidation threshold can have some benefits against stETH/ETH depeg, it presents a high risk for users borrowing stablecoins collateralized by stETH, especially when knowing Celsius is under stress right now.  This Aave governance proposal hasn\u2019t passed yet and there is a possibility that it won\u2019t since part of the community objected to the proposal. That said, we believe that Maker should proceed with caution in this case, especially now when already the low revenue (1.40% APY) from this exposure doesn\u2019t offset the potential tail risks. Depending on the developments in coming weeks, @Risk-Core-Unit will present their view on the situation at the next MOMC meeting in about 2 weeks (and potentially suggesting to enable D3M back on).    Pros  Protects the Surplus Buffer and Maker holders by reducing the risk posed by the Aave D3M.   Cons  Turns off the Aave D3M leading to reduced revenue for Maker     Should we set the Aave D3M bar to 0%?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps This Signal Request will run for 24 hours until Wednesday, June 15th at 20:00 UTC. If a majority of non-abstaining voters vote in favour, this will proceed to an expedited Executive Vote as soon as possible, GovAlpha and Protocol Engineering\u2019s schedules allowing (likely ready on Wednesday, June 15th). This will be outside the usual Executive Vote cadence, as permitted in MIP24 and MIP41. If there is a positive outcome to this Urgent Signal Request, it will override the ongoing Signal Request here, which will be cancelled.  Resources Further information on the Aave D3M and the bar parameter can be found here.  cc: @Risk-Core-Unit @Protocol-Engineering @GovAlpha-Core-Unit @Recognized-Delegates @gov-comms-core-unit ",

Lower the bar, and change the rate but going to identically 0 basically says Maker doesn\u2019t trust AAVE AT ALL and I think that sends the wrong message. If this is a reaction to a proposal that hasn\u2019t even passed it looks even worse honestly.    This whole assessment looks like Maker could lose ALL value in aDAI and I think Maker can mitigate this in a more measured way to basically raise the risk rate, and lower the bar to something the protocol can manage. While I consider protecting MKR and DAI holders of paramount importance I also consider the health and vitality of the entire DeFI community to be important as well and the message this sends about AAVE isn\u2019t one of a measured risk move by Maker but more of a knee jerk over reaction that isn\u2019t healthy. Appreciate Chris pointing out the oracle risks.   I don\u2019t see this in the list of reasons to take this action above (is oracle risk even a factor here?).  In fact I still have yet to see a statement regarding the real risks here as it is not clear to me Maker takes a 100% haircut on aDAI unless this event is existential to AAVE (which it might).   I tend to do my own analysis in terms of type of event \u2018and odds it happens\u2019 and then weigh the risk/rewards and do this over a collection of event types, odds and loss scenarios.     ChrisBlec:  However, the risks presented by this stETH situation in combination with the untenable 3rd party trust requirement in Chainlink are plenty of reason for pause.   ",

                    "content": "    twblack88:  Next steps after this is to evaluate in the MOMC meeting in two weeks correct @Primoz ?   Correct, this is the default practice at monthly MOMC meetings. Let me be clear again that our proposal is of temporary nature. Contagion risks in DeFi are increasing - from UST blowup, we got potentially bankrupt Celsius this week, there are now rumors about 3AC having margin call problems, BlockFi could be next because it lends to 3AC and so on. You simply want to cut exposure in such times because there are so many unknown risks (Tether being a shareholder of Celsius comes next to mind). We could be dealing with Lehman\u2019s moment in crypto. And everyone is probably overreacting but this makes risks even more severe. The beauty of D3M is that we can react in time unlike with other vaults so we can turn it off instantly. I also see some benefits in testing the instant unwind mom contract (no GSM delay). Finally, the downside of doing this is that we pull 50m out of Aave and lose 14k DAI of revenue per week. We also won\u2019t affect rates much, the borrow rate will increase from 2.80% to 3.16%. If the community thinks we\u2019ll affect our relationship with Aave by doing this temporarily and by cutting current 50m exposure then I don\u2019t know how to respond. Now regarding potential risks, @LongForWisdom actually made a good thread on the other post about how many things need to go wrong here so that Maker actually starts carrying a decent loss from this exposure. I tend to agree, but then I look at our exposure to Celsius already at 230m and another 100m via Aave, mostly collateralized by stETH and liquidation threshold of 0.81 (LR of 123%), possibly to be increased to 0.9 (LR of 111%). In these times of distress you just want to hedge this if it can be done smoothly without affecting markets. Now if you want to hear a panic mode scenario at Aave from me, which I don\u2019t want to publicize too much, here is one. Assume ETH supply at Aave shrinks further because suppliers need to cut down leverage from ETH to protect against getting liquidated. Or simply they need ETH liquidity such as AC3 possibly right now. ETH utilization increases to dangerous levels and ETH borrowers can\u2019t repay since they can\u2019t sell enough stETH. Rumor starts spreading aETH suppliers both face liquidity risk and they start pulling ETH out and ETH utilization and borrow rate increases further. Aave reacts by increasing kink on ETH rate curve so that rates are still favorable to stETH/ETH users so they don\u2019t make a loss, which would force them to unwind. This again pushes ETH utilization to extreme levels. Essentially aETH starts carrying all the stETH illiquidity risks and finally stablecoin suppliers start realizing that their borrowed stablecoins are mostly collateralized by stETH indirectly (including us) instead of ETH and bank run on stablecoin deposits begins, also because the 1-2% supply rate is just not worth it. I am probably exaggerating the series of events here, but that\u2019s part of my job. ",

Want to retract my claims here - this wallet I was referring to which has dodged liquidation by few dollars in ETH price yesterday wasn\u2019t 3AC\u2019s as Nansen had wrong data or by Nansen words there was some crypto twitter confusion. In any case 200m liquidation would have been quite large for Aave if it happened. ",

If our data we just started collecting is correct, it seems largest liquidation event on Aave v2 ethereum market was $5.7m.     flipflopflapdelegate:  And how is your modeling for liquidating, say 100m, 50m, versus 200m\u2013have you or Gauntlet done any simulations of such?   It usually goes in tranches, because Aave liquidations work differently - up to 50% of debt can be liquidated at once and repeated until health factor improves. The simulation for this particular vault shows about $83m ETH gets liquidated if price crashes instantly by 15% and assuming keeper would liquidate 50% of debt available (even though the total debt size of it is $167m right now after repayments). This shows their liquidation system is actually quite efficient because they don\u2019t need to rely on oracle delay as we do. But the $83m is a lot assuming such sized ETH sale carries 10% slippage on-chain which is higher than the liquidation bonus received by keepers. ",

I just saw an AAVE keeper say that they can liquidate 10%, 20% and as you said, up to 50%. The important part is that the Health Rate improves above 1.00 \u2014 and the reason why this Keeper commented on this Telegram channel I follow is because we were watching this AAVE ETH vault deteriorate to a health ratio of 1.00 \u2014 nobody kicked the liquidation and ETH has bounced back from $870 and the vault is still alive at an HR of 1.05. Crazy stuff and glad the AAVE D3M has been disabled as a precaution until this deleveraging  stops. Here\u2019s the vault: DeBank | Your DeFi wallet Supposedly the vault was supposed to be liquidated at $895 ETH but\u2026   twitter.com    Dereek69 \ud83e\udee1 @Dereek70  He avoided it by 10 cents.
