                    "content": "Hello, I have been looking on the Dai Stats website wondering why the TVL for Maker reported here is much lower than Makers TVL reported other places. In the collateral list I found that collateral WSTETH-A currently has 110,917,636 Dai taken out against it. However, the TVL for WSTETH-A is 0.47, which does not make much sense. Other sources of TVL say that WSTETH-A should be contributing around $480,000,000 to the TVL right now. Just to clarify I am looking at Dai Stats. I tried to put a screenshot of what I am referring to below, hopefully it worked. Also, just to make sure I summed all the individual TVLs for collateral on Dai stats to make sure that they did not include a different number that is not shown on the UI. The TVL displayed on Dai Stats includes the 0.47 for that collateral and nothing else.  Screenshot1379\u00d7255 44.2 KB  Could someone please clarify if this is a bug or some else is going on? Thanks! ",
