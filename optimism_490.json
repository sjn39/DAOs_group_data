Growth Experiment Grants Project description: Bored Town is a vibrant community of 5555 NFT monsters living on the Optimism blockchain, crafted by Thai NFT artist sorryvrerror. The project offers an exceptional opportunity for Bored Town holders to unleash their creativity and bring their ideas to life through derivative works, whether for personal or commercial purposes, governed by CC BY-SA terms. On Bored Town\u2019s launch date of June 11th, 2022, our NFT project saw a tremendous response from the community with 20,000 transactions from 5,900 unique wallets interacting with our smart contract. This is a testament to the increasing demand for NFTs and the growing popularity of our project. Our efforts to onboard new users to Optimism have been successful, with 7,015 individuals joining the platform. Furthermore, our official collection launches have consistently caused launchpads to crash, further highlighting the excitement and anticipation surrounding our project. For reference: https://dune.com/frank_maseo/optimism-new-users-protocols-used  286198898_810541356626343_8111373899017253868_n1080\u00d7991 62.9 KB  Our NFT project is committed to giving back to the community. In the past year, we have generously distributed over 200 NFTs, 200 physical products, donated children\u2019s books to 10 schools in Thailand, and allocated 20% of our marketing budget and income towards minting rewards. Additionally, we have set aside 10% of the rewards for team members selected from among the community members who have contributed to our project. We have also transferred approximately 50 NFTs from our various Optimism collections to other projects for cross promotions. Our team has actively engaged with the NFT community both within and beyond the Web3 ecosystem. We have conducted NFT creator workshops in partnership with universities and technology companies, providing support and guidance to new artists and entrepreneurs seeking to establish their own NFT projects. Additionally, we have collaborated with our own physical business to integrate NFTs into real-world experiences, and have also worked with a publisher to release a series of children\u2019s books featuring characters from the popular Bored Town franchise. These books are scheduled to be published later this year, further expanding the reach and impact of our NFT initiatives. This commitment to community outreach and support is a fundamental part of our NFT project, and we believe that this focus on giving back will not only benefit the community but also help to grow and sustain our project over the long term.

Bored Town Community: Create a Bored Town 2D interactive map and mobile community that allows our holders to participate in activities, mint NFTs, and interact with our projects both online and in real life. 2. Catens NFT: https://twitter.com/CatensOfficial Our plan is to onboard more collectors to the Optimism platform through the Catens collection, a 100k project aimed at expanding the network of partnerships and collaborations. With a focus on ongoing drops and limited edition pieces, the Catens collection will feature exciting collaborations with Optimism\u2019s current and future partners. Our first collaboration, a 978 mint release with the Optimism project, Beers Can, and Omnichain launchpad Omnisea, has already produced a total of 3,000 pieces and received positive feedback from the community. Moving forward, we plan to collaborate with blue chip partners and other established players in the industry to produce up to 5,000 pieces for future drops. Additionally, we will offer smaller runs for new and emerging projects to support their growth. To further increase brand awareness and engagement, we propose creating a large run with Optimism incorporating the company\u2019s branding. 3. Dynamic NFT project: While we\u2019re using Catens for promotion and onboarding, our development team will be working on building our own software for creating dynamic NFTs. A beta version will be tested with Bored Town. A full version of the software will be launched in conjunction with the introduction of a new dynamic NFT collection that extends the art style created in Bored Town. 4. Bored Studio: Develop Bored Studio to foster the growth of the Optimism NFT ecosystem by onboarding and supporting new creators. We will provide tools, and guidance to help NFT creators bring their projects to life. Additionally, we will actively promote these projects to our community of art enthusiasts and collectors. To incentivize participation and reward our community members for their support, we will establish a mechanism for distributing rewards from Bored Studio to NFT holders. Optimism Alignment: In 2022, our frustration with L1 led us to discover the benefits of L2 and Optimism, specifically its low gas fees and the growing popularity of free mints. The release of our Bored Town collection was intended to not only showcase our art but also learn more about Optimism and its capabilities. Our continued experimentation with L2 chains led us to conclude that Optimism aligned best with our goals and was where we wanted to build our project. Bored Town shares Optimism\u2019s vision of a more open, accessible, and decentralized financial system, utilizing its technology to achieve this aim. Our focus on community building, supporting others, and fostering a common good aligns with Optimism\u2019s mission. We have already established connections and engaged in cross-promotions and collaborations with other projects within the Optimism community. We are eager to collaborate with Optimism and its team, and look forward to working together to further develop Bored Town. Our goal is to enhance the user experience and promote the growth of the collection by exploring new features and integrations offered by Optimism. Ecosystem Value Proposition: The Bored Town project is based in Thailand. There are almost 270,000 members in Thailand\u2019s NFT & crypto art community. In addition to a large percentage of collectors, we are home to many talented artists, developers, and NFT creators. Currently, many artists use multiple blockchains such as Near, Ethereum, Tezos, and Solana but need more resources and marketing skills to reach a wider audience and sustain a successful project. Our founder, who faced similar challenges, has a deep understanding of the obstacles faced by creators. Bored Studio aims to address these challenges by working with Optimism in creating tools and establishing a community that bridges the gap between artists and art collectors. Optimism is a reliable and low-cost blockchain with a promising future, and we see it becoming a leading platform for NFT art. Bored Studio is dedicated to empowering NFT artists and creators by breaking down language and technology barriers, building a community of art lovers, and providing the resources and tools necessary for success. Our goal is to spread awareness of Optimism\u2019s NFT space to more collectors and onboard new users from Southeast Asia to the web3 ecosystem. Number of OP tokens requested: 200,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No How much will your project match in co-incentives?:  10% of all royalties from Bored Town are donated to public goods. 50% of any future sales (currently free mint) and royalties from Catens will be allocated to public goods. In line with our dedication to fostering the growth of the Optimism ecosystem, we plan to make our dynamic NFT software open-source for the Optimism community following the project launch. This will allow others to build upon our work and further advance the NFT space on Optimism. In addition, holders of other Optimism NFT projects will be able to receive special incentives within our dynamic NFT collection.  Proposal for token distribution:   How will the OP tokens be distributed? 40% to develop and maintain the dynamic NFT project software that will be provided as open-source to the Optimism community after the project is completed. This software will also be developed for the Bored Town studio to provide shortcuts to the NFT creators who join our program. 40% to incentivize the community to create art, community participation, NFT minting, etc. 20% for the marketing budget for 6 months.    Amendment: This is an alternative plan for distribution in the event that our original proposal cannot be approved due to the \u2018no sale\u2019 rule.   How will the OP tokens be distributed? 25% of the budget will be allocated towards promotion and incentives aimed at rewarding current Bored Town holders and attracting new collectors. The allocation will be distributed across a range of initiatives, including staking, giveaways, raffles, and quests on Quest3. Additionally, a portion of the funds will be used to acquire NFTs from other Optimism projects and artists to serve as prizes to our holders. 35% percent of the budget will be devoted to the Catens:  25% will be utilized for mint-to-earn, raffles, and giveaways programs. 10% of the budget will be earmarked for cross-promotion and rewards for art contests and onboarding new artists.  40% of the budget will be dedicated to the promotion and reward program of our dynamic NFT project. This allocation covers a mint-to-earn initiative, an $OP bounty for contributors who generate promotional content and memes, Quest3 events, and other incentives. Holders of Bored Town collections on Optimism, including the Bored Town series, Ape Warrior, The Vintract, Alpha Gal, Mangmoom, Xmas ABC, and Catens, will be granted special traits for the dynamic NFT. Non-holders will have the chance to earn non-holder traits through quests leading up to the dynamic NFT launch. Cross-promotions with other Optimism projects will also offer opportunities for special traits and incentives.      Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? 6 months   Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up? Bored Town is a pioneering NFT community on the Optimism blockchain. To jumpstart growth and foster a thriving NFT market, the project will launch with an incentivized program aimed at accelerating market maturity and stability. Despite relying on initial funding from Optimism, we are confident that the Bored Town project will be self-sustaining even after the grant funds have been utilized. Our commitment to the long-term growth and development of Bored Town is reflected in our comprehensive plans for the future. We are confident that these initiatives will continue to drive the Bored Town brand forward and deepen its relationship with the Optimism ecosystem. Our focus on sustainability and growth will ensure the success and longevity of the Bored Town project.

Which attract me so much was, this collection really so special, totally different from all the NFT collections I saw before, I joined the mint, and watched the 1st crash on QX launch pad. As an investor of NFT, I bought some but at beginning just for a short-term revenue, the truth is I bought more and more when more and more free mint collections coming due to BTM, even now I don\u2019t sell any of BTM, even to list it\u2026\u2026 So, it was a Seed, and a gift. The team works very hard and Master really paid a lot of energy on all the BTM collection like her babies, I hope more and more people will know BTM, but Web3 is Web3, BTM need really help, as team only know how to paint and serve\u2026\u2026 They need,  Technical (Coding) support to improve Web3 attribute. Professional Defi support to active the economy. Funds support for marketing and promotion.  As already explained above, BTM is a seed and as well a gift, not only to me but also to the whole OP eco system, It shouldn\u2019t be silent otherwise OP will definitely lose a chance to be unique in the following L2 wars when the bull coming back.

I suggest @sorryvrerror and team consider taking this section out of the grant application completely. A good way to replace this is by utilizing the method that has worked for other NFT projects such as quest3 which I know this community is already familiar with\u2026 This works as a way to help provide brand awareness and interaction with the community on social media for marketing or advertising without directing funds directly to any sort of paid advertisement violating the sale rules. Providing a proper token distribution schedule for token rewards and some sort of proof of work verification to help protect from sybil attack\u2026 There are many integrations that you could utilize along with guild to make the qualifications for these rewards and verify human identity\u2026 Also GALXE has some great off chain and on chain requirements for claiming free NFTs which would help to build a list of holders that could also receive rewards after x amount of accomplishments with a tier system like OP quest \u2026 You can also utilize the existing collections of bored town for requirements of the token rewards on quest3. Provide as many off chain and on chain requirements to make these experiences as educational as possible about optimism ecosystem and your own project!!! These are my suggestions and I hope they are helpful! ",
