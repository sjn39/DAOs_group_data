In order to maximize attendance (and community impact), it\u2019s probably better to move it to one hour later. Can you please ask Loong if that would work for him? I have also asked Uniswap and will move it only if both projects accept. Otherwise we\u2019ll keep this time. Thanks in advance, Juan attn: @Jtathmann ",

Welcome again to another Collateral Onboarding call from MakerDAO. We have two projects today: REN presented by Loong and Uniswap presented by Hayden. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   REN  [REN] - MIP6 Collateral Application [renBTC] MIP6 Collateral Application [renBCH] MIP6 Collateral Application [renZEC] MIP6 Collateral Application  Loong Presentation 01:10 Loong Photo1055\u00d7675 442 KB Discussion  11:12 - SamM: What do you see as the upper bounds on the renBTC supply? If, say, 10% of Bitcoin wants to go to Ethereum, what\u2019s going to be the bottleneck of that? 13:10 - SamM: Would you say that the REN lock has to be comparable to the amount of Bitcoin moving through in terms of market cap? 14:42 - Juan: Can you briefly touch on how to contribute to the network and how to participate with the node? 16:55 - Frank Cruz: Can you explain to the Maker Community what was your thinking behind being a custodian right now, not completely decentralized? Also, what do you think is the outlook of Bitcoin on DeFi? Not just on Ethereum but also on other Layer 1 and possibly even on Layer 2 22:23 - Christopher Mooney: I\u2019m trying to recall at which phase the Greycore melts away and RenVM is collateralized by REN. Let\u2019s say, the bounded REN outweighing the amount of assets under custody that you have on RenVM. 24:06 - Christopher Mooney: I think we would like to start custody on renBTC to diversify our BTC exposure, but since you are going to get more assets under custody that you have to pull under custody and without the right economic incentives to balance that, I\u2019m worried that we stick you in the phase that you\u2019re stuck in right now and it makes it harder for you to move to the Greycore? 26:50 - Christopher Mooney: Have you guys considered possibly ensuring the BTC that you have under custody to mitigate some of the concerns around risk?

What does the transition look like? 36:08 - Frank Cruz: Are you guys going to do things like the Maker Foundation does? Are you going to decentralize by having different teams? Is it something you are going to build? 39:11 - SamM: Is there any sense of which liquidity tokens they are planning on extending the rewards for or even if they are planning to extend the rewards?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 42:16  Thanks again for joining us. It was really good having you! Next Wednesday we will have the team from Crypto.com presenting their own collateral type and EURStasis, they want to speak about a new ramp.  Credits  Pablo N\u00fa\u00f1ez produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
