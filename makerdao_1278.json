                    "content": " MIP65 - Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction Verification According to MIP65, Strategic Finance CU should provide an Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction Verification.  The Strategic Finance Facilitator must, also through a public forum post, provide a Verification of the Asset Purchase and Allocation Restriction ensuring that only execution of bond strategies appropriate to use as large scale liquid RWA collateral can be acquired with assets provided to the legal structure by Maker.  This is not financial advice and shouldn\u2019t be relied on for any financial decision. It is merely theoretical research done by a non-professional. It is understood that the final allocation will be decided by the Maker Governance, possibly using external financial advisors. This verification only assumes a maximum invested amount of 500M DAI.  Balance sheet context As of writing, the balance sheet of MakerDAO is composed of around $4 billion in stablecoins on top of which 500 million USDC would be added if we unwound the DAI/USDC liquidity pool vaults (that aren\u2019t generating much revenues, 0-5bps). This 4.5B liquidity buffer position is against 6B of circulating DAI (net of unwinding DAI/USDC LPs). The liquidity reserves are therefore 75% of circulating DAI. Early work on the DAI maturity profile shows that more than 50% of DAI are sticky (likely to remain for at least 3 months). Liquidity is therefore significant. The Surplus Buffer is at 85M DAI and there is 15M DAI of excess DAI in operating wallets leading to almost 100M DAI of capital buffer. With the decrease of crypto-lending, our Capital at Risk remains low between 25 and 50M DAI. The financial investment considered here are low volatility with a Capital at Risk way below 4%. An investment of 500M DAI in this context, that is expected to remain liquid and low volatility, is therefore not a significant risk for the DAI peg nor the solvency of MakerDAO.  Notes on the Proposed Allocations  BlackRock ETF portfolio The first bucket of the allocation will be done through Blackrock using two ETF:  IB01: iShares $ Treasury Bond 0-1 yr UCITS ETF IBTA: iShares $ Treasury Bond 1-3 yr UCITS ETF  Both track US-Treasury bonds portfolios with the difference being the duration and the maturity. IB01 has a duration of 0.38 while IBTA has a duration 1.88. Duration is a proxy of the expected loss in mark-to-market value when there is a 1% unexpected increase in interest rate. Being issued by the Treasury, there is no expected possible loss if the bonds are held to maturity (the exception being if the US Government default on their debt). Both are based in Ireland and are accumulating ETFs (i.e. interest payments are accrued to the ETF shares). As of writing, the yield to maturity are respectively 1.6% and 3%. The former yield is expected to increase in the near future. Both are liquid and the governance processes will be the major limitation in speed of execution for redeeming.  Baillie Gifford  Counterparty As stated by MIP13c3-SP12: Counterparties involved in the operations should be established and reputable companies (using metrics such as Asset under Administration and Asset under Management); Baillie Gifford has assets under management north of $450B as of the end of 2021 and has existed for more than a century. The credit portion is smaller, with ~$4.5bn in assets. The company is owned by its 47 partners. It is clearly in the reputable companies bucket.  Liquidity For the Treasury side, no liquidity issues are expected as treasuries are one of the most liquid markets. As discussed by BG, liquidity for corporate bonds is not a major concern in normal market operations. It would be less liquid during TradFi market stress. Moreover, as it is only a subset of the expected allocation, it is less of a burden.  Investment strategy: Governement bonds Baillie Gifford suggests two strategies for Government bonds. The passive mandate will be similar to the BlackRock allocation. Using a Separately Managed Account could be more efficient and flexible but additional transactions will make it less transparent. ETFs may have better liquidity but it is unclear if it matters in short-term governement bonds. It is unclear at this stage which is better for MakerDAO\u2019s needs and probably a mix could be the ideal situation anyway. Regarding the proposal to invest in global governement bonds (30% max allocated to non-US but fully currency hedged and at least AA-rated), it would require significant time and research to have an informed opinion. For 25bps, it seems to add complexity. For instance, France is a AA-rated country yet it has a 66bps spread vs Germany. Is France going to default? That\u2019s unlikely but is it a risk we want to take? That will be for the community and MKR holders to decide.  Investment strategy: Corporate bonds You can review the assessment previously completed here.  Conclusion Both BlackRock and Baillie Gifford would be great counterparties to allocate the balance sheet to short-term bonds. A combination seems to provide sound diversification and optionality to MakerDAO. As discussed in Towards taking asset risk, adding corporate bonds increases the risk/reward ratio. It is also coherent with the Declaration of Intent. Yet adding some BB bond and/or perpetuals (IG+ option) may not be appropriated. Those could most likely increase returns of the investment but I would advise that we perform more research. In the same vein, the US Treasury+ option, adding other government bonds on top of the US Government allocation would probably increase returns without too much added risk. Yet, to be safe, we should perform more research on the topic before taking misunderstood risks. The options are the followings:     # Portfolio Construct BR  P1 BR  P2 BG  IG BG  IG+ BG  UST BG  UST+     1 US Short Treasuries(100%) 100% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%   2 US Short T(85%) + G10 Gov Bond(15%) 50% 0% 0% 0% 0% 50%   3 US Short T(80%) + IG Corp Bond(20%) 50% 0% 20% 0% 30% 0%   4 US Short T(71%) + G10 Gov Bond(9%) + IG Corp Bond(20%) 50% 0% 20% 0% 0% 30%   5 US Short T(68%) + G10 Gov Bond(12%) + IG Corp Bond(16%) + BBB/BB Corp Bond(4%) 40% 0% 0% 20% 0% 40    It seems that options 1 or 3 could be well-suited to start the MakerDAO journey into a short-term bond allocation. Again, it is Maker Governance that needs to make the decision. ",

                    "content": "Hi @Traster_Tray In terms of implementation cost/effort there is realistically nothing saved from going with only one instead of two solutions/providers. The large efforts sit around getting the operating structure working - and that is needed no matter whether we work with one, two or three (trustee, committee, cash agent, auditor, bank, custody, reporting etc). In terms of timing, BR is a market purchase, so as soon as money is in the appropriate custody account, the ETF products can be purchased instantly and as such would be fully deployed. BG - as it is an investment mandate - takes a bit longer in implementation - but not too much - give it an extra month or so until deployed in comparison. I am not sure I have mentioned this earlier, but I will note that the list of asset managers potentially interested in working with Maker for this bond strategy shrank dramatically post Luna and the arrival of \u201cwinter\u201d (\u2026\u201clet\u2019s wait and see in 6+ months time\u201d\u2026). One could argue that those of substantive quality who remained positive and productive in developing an immediate working relationship with Maker under the current market circumstances (BR/Sygnum + BG), might be predictive of a more resilient, long-term positive view on Maker and long-term partnership stability? And one could maybe further argue that these are exactly the market circumstances where you want as many strong, resilient partners as you can get? Just something to think about. Specifically will taking option #1 impact future opportunities with BG? Impossible to predict - I am pretty sure they will be professional about it - and engage with the opportunity on its merits as it would stand at such a point in time in the future. ",

However, the 20% allocation equates to 100 mil and even with shorter duration investment grade bonds, it is borderline uncomfortable to me when recession risks are high.  BR treasury ETFs with lower fees and lower risk are obviously much more attractive right now and can be scaled without credit risk worries. However, I am for the relationship with BG and working out a connection there though I\u2019m not sure about the BG investment mandate.  I\u2019m curious how important the current mandate is to the BG fund managers who are willing to work with us.  Is this a relationship where the strategy is locked in or would we be looking to modify the mandate over time?  Actually to me, it\u2019s preferable to lock in different teams to different strategies and respond to changes in macro environment simply through varying debt ceilings.  But I ask the question just for clarity\u2019s sake. ",

Hi Seb - To my recollection, none of the existing transactions (other than HVB) actually contemplate the use of idle cash to earn interest for Maker. I might be wrong, but I believe this is an improvement on what currently exists in other deals. In the HVB transaction, since the idle cash will only be \u201cidle\u201d for short periods (until either used to purchase participations or distributed as income to the Surplus Buffer), very liquid, short-term instruments seemed the best option. Our approach is consistent with what you might typically see in a securitization or project financing. I do not disagree with your comment, but wanted to clarify why we proposed a very liquid, short-term instrument for HVB. ",

In other words, newer US treasuries will pay you a higher interest rate. Assuming MakerDAO buys 26-week Treasury Bills tomorrow morning and interest rates go up by say 200 basis points in the next 3-months. The older bills that MakerDAO will own tomorrow morning will be less attractive over the next 3-months( as rates go up). What happens when everyone wants to redeem their DAI for USDC via the PSM? Maker will  have to sell their treasury bills in the secondary market. Because those bills are less attractive now, the sell price may be lower than the price they were bought at. If that happens, Maker may be unable to pay all the PSM users in time. The protocol might need to ask the PSM users to wait to redeem their DAI at 1:1 and if they are willing to wait for the bills to mature. This is similar to what Celsius is doing (not allowing withdrawals) and could also lead to bad publicity. With that in mind, how does Maker mitigate avoiding the inability to provide liquidity back to the PSM? ",

                    "content": "Additionally, I think something people misunderstand in regards to interest rate risk is that projected rate hikes are already priced into treasury rates.  Current fed funds rate is 1.5% - 1.75% but 1 year tbills are almost yielding 3%.  So point being even if the fed continues hiking rates, you may not lose money.  You only start getting hit if they start to or signal they will hike more than expected, most likely because inflation stays high.  On the other hand, if inflation numbers start to moderate (say if there is a recession), that rate curve inverts and you can capture your value early, selling at a profit if it makes sense to put the money elsewhere. Anyhow, not needing to sell at the wrong time is always best and as @TRUEMAKER stated 500 mil is safe.  If our PSMs get down to 500 mil, we\u2019re probably in big trouble and doing stuff like increasing the DSR before reaching the point where we have to sell these treasuries.  At some point though, we\u2019ll need to start scaling and getting comfortable with the small amount of interest rate risk.  The risk is there, no doubt\u2026but that\u2019s why we reference the ALM model to understand capital at risk metrics and make sure we have adequate buffer for losses.  It\u2019s also why shorter duration treasuries did so well in the model.  In the current environment, this asset makes sense\u2026which is why it works for the Fed to dry up liquidity.  We\u2019re no exception.  For a conservative project like MKR, It\u2019s uncomfortable.  But for us to survive the environment, many of us are more than willing to trade some of our own liquidity for those guaranteed returns. ",

I have written a bit about this dynamic in the bond meets maker if you want to dig into this issue a bit more with some numbers and historical data etc. All in all, the realistic market-value risk from this DAI 500M, in these assets, should be very limited, but just to follow your logic to its natural end: if we have a complete PSM emptying and the interest rate environment has very materially increased (i.e. in excess of what is already priced in)  then an immediate, forced liquidation will potentially be at lower market-value than outstanding, matching DAI - should not be by a lot as these short duration bonds have limited sensitivity to interest rates, but, sure, could be negative in a very extreme and unlikely case. In this situation making all DAI holders whole, instantly, would require a draw from the surplus buffer - this is the only place you can go for a \u201ctop up\u201d. This, in truth, is a very very extreme situation and any such draw should be limited. I think, however, your concern becomes more pressing as Maker moves from DAI 500M to many, many billions in bonds for obvious reasons. We do need to explore, and potentially implement (depending on the views of the Maker community), more layers of liquidity and market-value protections as we move into the billions. We are acutely aware of this and, at the current moment, exploring two avenues (more may appear as we keep digging deeper into this):  Credit-lines backed on the bond portfolio that will allow us to draw cash within hours to meet liquidity demands. To i) increase speed in putting liquidity back to Maker ii) prevent a liquidation happening under a market stress situation iii) access to liquidity in a market lock-up situation. A derivative-based protection program against potential negative market movements that could lead to illiquidity or material market-value losses.  We will come back to the community on this as some of these avenues turn into actual proposals - ultimately any such protection has costs associated with them so the community has to discuss what are the right trade-offs for Maker to make.

For these companies milestones are set for what sustainability changes BG hope to see from the company over the next 3 years. Often the company is then engaged with directly on these issues by BG to promote sustainability/resilience progress. If sufficient progress against the milestones are not seen, then the company is disinvested. Here are some examples:  845\u00d7403 160 KB  I quote from BG on these examples:  \"\u2026A company like VW has had some well-publicised governance issues but through engagement we have been satisfied there has been improvement.  Looking at its footprint as a business, today it still predominantly produces vehicles with internal combustion engines, but as one of the largest manufacturers in the world it has potential to make a significant impact as it transitions to electric vehicles. Abrdn is a good example of a company which is low risk from an ESG perspective.  We can make judgements about its practices from an ESG standpoint, but as a large financial services company it does not really have the scope to make a meaningful positive impact (for example, compared to a niche manager offering only impact products). We view Dell as a leader given its early adoption of net zero commitments and industry-leading recycling efforts. Heimstaden Bostad, meanwhile, can help to enable the transition by focusing on sustainable living throughout its portfolio.  It is investing in long-term properties, working in a resource efficient manner, and helping to deal with societal challenges like climate change, segregation and housing shortages\u2026\"  BG has a reasonably large Sustainability team and is happy to offer an AMA on these measures and considerations/logic behind the framework if the community is interested?
