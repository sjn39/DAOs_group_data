I believe, with the help of the Community, CU\u2019s and delegates, we can make this happen. Should this be something the community agrees with, then Oasis Pro Markets and Monetalis, in collaboration, pledges to act as the \u201creal-world hands\u201d to make it happen. I cannot, exactly, at this hour, tell you what will be the specific means of execution, but I will strive for getting to a situation where, as real-world collateral, we will have a loan obligation from the Nation of Ukraine (preferably a recognized bond) held by a Monetalis-Maker BVI Trust (or similar) structure and then a vault, setup specifically for this situation, and an immediate DAI minting (and probably exchange to USD) and payment. To be clear, this will require some \u201chustling\u201d, and, very likely, the ultimate solution will involve documentation, governance and structural backfilling post making a payment - due to the obvious time constraints that is around getting such a payment to the right parties. We will have to run this execution a little bit on community trust and faith. This is clearly not an S&P AAA credit opportunity, but, in this case, I choose to believe in the continued existence of Ukraine, and the long-term means and intentions of repaying any debt, Maker may warrant to extend to Ukraine. Unfortunately I cannot make any guarantees that we will succeed in making this happen. This is an exceptionally fluid situation. But I can guarantee we will bring our best game to make this  happen. Given the urgency, you see here two polls, that we will have open only for the next 24 hours.    Should Maker lend DAI to Ukraine ASAP?  Yes No     0 voters        If, Yes, then how much should Maker lend?  DAI 1M DAI 2.5M DAI 5M     0 voters     Thank you for considering this!

That said, I think the DAO is positioned well to take action here, absorb any risk of a surplus-relative small amount, and that the proposal should be driven forward. Hopefully, some contours of the DAO\u2019s action can be better formed in the formal on-chain proposal - which is a possibility since this poll is so indefinite. I also think that we should leave geo-political opinions out of it - hence I would like to see a focus on humanitarian aid/support in whatever this proposal\u2019s final form is. ",

I fear that the complete inertia surrounding RWA poses serious problems for Dai growth   If this is your concern, then maybe you can voice it in a separate thread and have a community discussion there. Spending 5M in a project that is unlikely to be executed timely (just for governance reasons, I mean we are MakerDAO) , will be insanely risky, and will not move the needle (either for us of Ukraine) isn\u2019t a good way to voice your concerns. There were complaints about the slowness of RWA in 2020 and @equivrel made a Signal Request, leading to the creation of the RWA WG then the RWF CU, and the onboarding of RWA. So governance actions can have an impact.     luca_pro:  sometimes inertia is confused with a professional defensive stance for the good of the protocol. A stance that hides immense work behind it. As a good parent, it is much harder to say no than yes.   As a DAO, it makes sense to leave the decision-making to the MKR holders (and the definition of what is \u201cgood\u201d for the protocol). At the same time, if CUs are taking the decision-making and MKR are not saying anything, well it\u2019s not completely the fault of CUs either. ",

Below just a few points:   People who would like to propose a Maker donation to a Ukraine-based humanitarian charity I can only encourage to do so. Today I collected and bought clothes, blankets, diapers and foodstuff - and we filled a big horse truck here in St Andrews in Scotland - and tonight two volunteers will start a long drive to the Polish/Ukrainian border to deliver it all. I can only encourage others to do the same. The refugee crisis is quite real.   I clearly should not have written War bond - it wasn\u2019t a deeply considered word choice from my side. Those War Bonds, that seem to have a strong military spending purpose, you read about in the newspaper, I think, were sold out even before I got around to posting this poll. What we are actually doing is working with various parties in Ukraine to figure out ways in which we can provide financing for mainly humanitarian purposes (watersupply, housing, medical supplies, foodstuff etc etc) in the short-term, and potentially redevelopment in the longer term. And that is financing backed by the government (preferably in a bond format). Also, if all else fails, exploring how we can get setup to participate in a straight-forward standard Ukraine government bond round that might be around the corner - all in all we are just trying to be entrepreneurial about it and truly have only started this process a few days ago. At anyrate, any financial instrument we might find/construct, will be duly presented to the community before any transaction can happen.   Monetalis is Green Economy and ESG laser-focused. Not looking to finance rockets and tanks any time soon.   ",

Some of which are currently residing in cites being attacked by aerial bombardment and artillery fire. I will therefore not vote in the current poll, but offer some thoughts on the idea. While I have more motivation than most to immediately jump on the idea I think we should consider both some of the opportunities this affords us and some of the risks we take on. In my opinion the greatest opportunity this affords us is to gain political good will. Europe and the US has imposed perhaps the harshest economic sanctions on Russia in history. We are witnessing an unprecedented effect on the Russian economy. Crypto has come under fire as a means for Russia to mitigate parts of those sanctions and thus cause damage to the reputation of crypto in public opinion. There has already been talks about ways to target crypto with sanctions in order to prevent Russia from using it. If this proposal gains approval we should do everything in our power to make it as public as possible to show that Maker can be a force for good. Building on that objective I think Maker should be very careful to be too hasty to get into directly financing war. We should instead clearly focus on humanitarian aid. As is fairly normal in war the civilian population of Ukraine is rapidly running out of basic necessities as well as medicine. There will be a tremendous need for money to pay for this. If we can get recognition for this effort I believe this will also put Maker even more on the map for other actors in RWF and can be a door opener. Even into taking on other forms of sovereign debts which typically fits with Maker\u2019s preferred risk level. Increased recognition can also increase our legal risk. Not all political processes are run in a strictly analytical fashion. Sometimes names that stick out in the media are the ones that end up taking the brunt of the heat once lawmakers gets to writing, or government agencies gets to work. We should also consider the risk of our counterparty in this case. Ukraine even before the war was struggling with corruption. Now there is a reasonable chance that the current government might be forcefully replaced. That has to be balanced by potentially turning a sovereign government into an ally. I firmly believe that in the long run Ukraine is going to emerge from this conflict as a welcomed member of the European community with a reputation for heroism and defiance. Given the unprecedented economic and military support given by the EU and other European states I am convinced that regardless of the devastation brought upon the country it will rise from the ashes in the same way the world witnessed the rise of West-Germany following World War II. Further into the future I believe there is an opportunity in providing credit to the rebuilding effort that must surely follow. One that we might prepare for even now. Personally I believe in Ukraine. I hope Maker will too. ",

Or even\u2026 what about a project that takes 5M, subdivides that in portions of 150.000 and then sends the donations to 33 different humanitarian projects around the globe? On the other hand, as @psychonaut said, speaking about a \u201cloan\u201d or any other kind of financial speculation, in situations like these, sounds like taking advantage, even when I\u2019m sure this is not the case here Regarding to the geopolitical side of things I think, @John_Yarwood, that is impossible to avoid; in fact, it is not healthy trying to dismiss the geopolitical and even moral derivations of this kind of issues.

If we are financing long-term rebuilding of the nation, that is a non-urgent process that will only start after the war is over. There will be plenty of time to discuss exactly how that should be done and what role Maker can play. Lastly, in terms of process, there appear to be a lot of brand new accounts created after this poll started that have voted on this poll. The poll settings have not set a minimum trust_level score for participation. Please consider these factors before we jump into this decision. ",

Allan_Pedersen:  Given the urgency, you see here two polls, that we will have open only for the next 24 hours.   I find this sense of urgency totally out of place (and indeed Maker should implement some kind systematic filters against rushed decisions/polls). Emotions rarely help in making good decisions. Perhaps it is better to turn off the TV/twitter for a while. There will be a lot to reconstruct in Ukraine over the next few years and many opportunities to help. (IF THAT IS THE REAL GOAL, as opposed to just PR, which would be doubly-sad). ",
