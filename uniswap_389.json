We need to prohibit exchanges holding UNI like Coinbase and Binance from having enough voting power to vote themselves whatever they like, while also preventing a few whales from conspiring to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else. If we dont prevent this from happening, they could simply vote to drop themselves all of the UNI to a few wallets and then dump it. I still like the idea of pre-snapshot wallets and liquidity providers getting small airdrops each year as a way to cut down on this from happening. ",

What @ZannLii2 proposed unfortunately would just make things worse. Because it\u2019s really easy to split your UNI between 1000 addresses for a whale. Almost the same effort comes with 10000 addresses - it\u2019s easy for whales to automate. This proposition can be easily gamed. And there\u2019s also a causality issue: in order to implement protectionist measures you need enough votes in the present voting system, to begin with. But the main problem is you need a lot of people who own a small amount of UNI to mobilize. To be participating in governance, to be interested in voting, etc. And to be united by the same interests. UNI token distribution is a very inspiring event in my opinion. But as we can see from the level of activity on the forum so far, apparently not many people are that interested in Uniswap governance. But it\u2019s not all bad. A lot of tokens will belong to investors and the team, who probably will be vote more actively. And a lot of tokens belong to liquidity providers on Uniswap. Overall I consider the distribution as safe for the most part. ",

Would agree it\u2019s unfortunate that this is the case but there is also no point denying the truth but I think once Admins lay down some proper ground rules for this forum and spell out clearly that this forum is for the Purposes of Government and not a general forum then I think we will start to weed out these duplicate accounts and account here purely for the airdrops and start to see the accounts that really care for governance and the greater good of Uniswap.

Of course, it is much better to think of these things beforehand than after they\u2019ve already happened. But it\u2019s not the whales we should be looking to get protection from. We need to protect against bad actors . Who could benefit from Uniswap failing to the extent that it would be worth sacrificing the value one would have otherwise? Currently, I can\u2019t think of an equation where, if you\u2019re a rational actor, it\u2019s beneficial for you to compromise Uniswap governance in a blatantly harmful way. But it doesn\u2019t mean we should stop thinking about that at all. Maybe think more in-depth about the conditions that would make such overrun profitable for a rational actor. ",

The airdrop event was a great catalyst, perhaps enough of one to engage a critical mass of  small holders to want to participate in governance - This will be my first foray. How to approach weighted voting, countering manipulation, fear of whale dumps are important considerations as we may one day retire on this. I caught myself feeling a little disappointed that I was too late to check out Andre Cronje\u2019s oversubscribed proposal but that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to avoid isn\u2019t it? A group asking questions aimed at keeping  the 200k+ little guys relevant is interesting to me. We all know crypto is infested with bad actors, the question is should I take my money and run or if I help to grow something, will my windfall be secure? On the strength of what I\u2019ve read so far, if this group organized into something with a delegation address - I might likely delegate to it and I think a lot of other people would too without necessarily participating in the dialogue,  enough to surprise us all perhaps.
