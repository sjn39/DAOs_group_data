Another option is EIP 123. Original issue: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1464 The end-user public is increasingly exposed to technical details like EIP numbers. I hope we can please come to a consensus on this issue and use it consistently in the EIP repo. This is the same process we went through to standardize on using the eips.ethereum.org URLs instead of the GitHubs URLs (see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs#preferred-citation-format). I\u2019m not asking you to do any work. Just please confirm if there is appetite here to make this change, and if we can be happy with one consistent format. I will then use this mandate to:  Make a PR which fixes the EIPs repository (other than the actual EIPs) this requires EIP editor signoff Make PRs against individual EIPs to use this consistent format, and request they accept the change  ",
