                    "content": "Hi Uniswap Community, There has been a lot of discussion around the liquidity mining program recently, and I think a lot of nuance is getting lost in the weeds. I want to begin a discussion around what our \u201cNorth Star\u201d is, and argue that we are not solving for the right metric by arbitrarily distributing UNI via liquidity mining. What is the real goal of liquidity mining? It may be tempting to say that \u201cliquidity\u201d is the ultimate goal of these programs, and that they\u2019ve been very successful in that context. But liquidity is a means to an end. We try to source liquidity so that we can provide the best price discovery, which will then lead to more traders using Uniswap over other venues, and ultimately to more volume flowing through the platform. Targeting liquidity in order to achieve greater volume has been a decent strategy and, at least so far, has been successful. But, I believe this strategy has reached the point where we are now solving for the metric and not the problem. It\u2019s kind of like when colleges decided to use SATs as a metric to find intelligent students. At a certain point you just start getting students who are great and standardized tests and not much else \u2013 SATs are a good approximation, but they need to be taken in the context of the other dimensions of a \u201cgood student.\u201d What brings traders to Uniswap? The decision-making process of traders is multi-dimensional. Liquidity mining solves for only one of those dimensions. The three primary factors that bring traders to Uniswap (in my opinion) are:  Cost of execution (liquidity/fees) Ease of use (distribution within aggregators and front-ends) Availability of assets (listings are not controlled by a centralized entity)  Item 3 is fortunately implicit to Uniswap being a decentralized protocol. Item 1 has been aided by liquidity mining. But item 2 has been Uniswap\u2019s true competitive advantage - without better distribution, volumes may have went permanently to Sushiswap in the \u201cvampire attack\u201d and we\u2019d likely be in a much worse competitive position today. The LPs that remained on Uniswap were rewarded with high organic fees, even after the majority of liquidity left the protocol. This is the kind of sticky competitive advantage we need to encourage. What brings liquidity providers to Uniswap? The other side of this coin is of course the LPs themselves. They also have a multidimensional decision making process. I believe they look for:  Volume (fees they can generate, governance tokens/liquidity mining schemes) Security (battle-tested code) Inventory management (x*y = k)  In my opinon, item 3 stands to be improved, as different assets should have different inventory management strategies (e.g. Curve has done a nice job of this for stablecoins). Item 2 is unique to Uniswap, but also to its forks. Item 1 is the sole factor that we, as a community, can help to control. So how do we deploy resources to grow trading volumes and not just liquidity? If you don\u2019t already see where this is going\u2026we need to focus on distribution in order to grow trading volumes. None of this is to say that we should stop liquidity mining altogether. It is to say that we should be benchmarking these efforts based on how much volume the protocol is doing at different levels of liquidity, and that we should cease devoting resources (UNI) to a strategy with decreasing marginal returns. Instead, we should focus on deploying UNI intelligently towards furthering our distribution \u2013 more aggregators, more front-ends, more third party platforms that route through the protocol. Thanks for reading and I\u2019m looking forward to having a discussion. ",

                    "content": "@g_dip thanks for this post! I agree that liquidity and TVL in themselves are not really good success metrics for Uniswap. Volume is a much better gauge of platform adoption and usage, and also naturally benefits LPs through fee returns. I\u2019ve been thinking about ways that Uniswap can try to broaden distribution and integrations with other platforms and wallets. One idea that comes to mind is payment for order flow. In traditional finance, large market making firms will pay stock broker firms for the ability to trade against their clients\u2019 orders. Market makers get more volume, while brokers receive referral revenue. Many brokers use this payment for order flow revenue to subsidize their services (eg. Robinhood and other online brokers eliminating trade commissions), which can help further increase trade volume like a flywheel effect. If Uniswap were to turn on the fee switch, part of the money earned from the 0.05% protocol swap fee could be given to integrators or referrers. This would incentivize platforms to route more volume through Uniswap, and LPs would come out ahead as long as trade volume increased by at least 20% (to counterbalance their earnings reductions from lower swap fees). In the shorter term, we could also subsidize integrators via UNI distributions instead of re-routed swap fees. But we would need to ensure that the UNI subsidy never exceeds the swap fee, otherwise there would be perverse incentives for wash trading. ",

But imagine Robinhood integrating Uniswap as its primary crypto-to-crypto trading venue - it would be unstoppable. As you mentioned, traditionally you could handle this with a legal contract. We\u2019ll have to get more creative. One idea is to have integrators submit proposals to Uniswap governance, where integrators must be onboarded one by one. For instance, there could be two tiers of volume-incentivized integrations proposals: (a) Exclusive integrator - Uniswap is the only venue where users can trade crypto-to-crypto (b) General integrator - Uniswap is one of many venues where users can trade crypto-to-crypto This would allow us to reward group (a) to a greater extent than group (b), and would allow governance to turn rewards on/off based upon compliance.
