                    "content": "I linked a hot and cold wallet for delegated voting on vote.makerdao.com. I was expecting to approve() the IOU token and then receive them at some point (so that I can redeem my MKR from the governance contract, I believe). The docs say I should have at least called approve(). However, I performed no transaction that had anything to do with IOU. There was a small issue with the linking of the wallets that forced a refresh of the page (I was unable to click next after the MKR approve() took ~10 min). When I did this, I had to finish the link flow from the home page by clicking \u201cTop Up\u201d. Anyway, I am able to deposit, withdraw, and vote just fine, so it looks like I may not need the IOU tokens. Am I supposed to at least have a balanceOf() of these tokens? If so, why do I see 0 when I call balanceOf() my cold and hot wallets? If there are no IOU tokens for linked wallets, why not? And can the documentation be updated to reflect accordingly. Thank you.
