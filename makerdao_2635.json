                    "content": "@Akiva this is a great idea. There are a few avenues we\u2019ve been looking at for dealing with RWAs in MCD. When dealing with security tokens (which DROP fall into) this is one way we have identified. Treating the keeper auction as sale of regulated securities and making sure that this is done in a compliant way. Broker-Dealers and Transfer Agents are a likely component of this ecosystem and I\u2019m looking forward to hear what Sam is going to share with us about this. I think though this probably is better named: Legal Risk for Security Tokens Meeting and not Legal Risk in RWA Meeting as neither @mrabino1\u2019s proposal using the trust structure without any collateral onchain and our proposed liquidation mechanism for short term assets are a different category but both considered RWAs.

It turns out the event will not be happening as planned because the executive vote didnt pass. Instead I may do a working group for my subproposal. Btw the question we are dealing with does not have to do with keepers broker-dealers or transfer agents. The question we wanted to deal with is \u201chow can MakerDAO participate in contracts given that MakerDAO is not a legal entity\u201d Hopefully we can reschedule this for October or November after some proposal passes for dealing with risk parameters.

I like the idea of relying on the historicaly trusted actor to initiate the asset pull in case borrow co is delinquent payments.

I don\u2019t see @mrabino1\u2019s proposal as conflicting with what we\u2019re doing. In fact using a trust as the legal entity coupled with our tech stack can probably add a layer of security that the SPV we use right now currently does not have (although with a backup servicer in place today, we already have an entity that can directly interfere in the SPVs operations should the asset originator stop servicing it adequately). Our efforts in the liquidation mechanism that we proposed are twofold:  It is an efficient way of liquidating short term collateral independent of the legal questions that you face otherwise It is a simple and safe solution that we can deploy quickly. This is is a major advantage over a solution with a trust and a BD setup.  In our conversations with our legal counsel we did evaluate using a professional trustee to take this role and while legally possible, as you said \u201cthey have a reputation at stake\u201d and are very very careful with doing anything that is out of the ordinary. The risk for them is simply too high given the at the moment relatively small opportunity for them. It will cost hundreds of thousands if not millions in legal fees (I\u2019m not exaggerating) to go through this and will take months. That itself shouldn\u2019t be holding us back to actually pursuing it as long term it will probably be worth it. But launching at a small scale with other options has big advantages: we learn about all the other issues that come with onboarding this new collateral to Maker. ",
