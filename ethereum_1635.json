An example would be a token that automatically pays 1% of the total transaction amount to a predetermined contract or wallet. I did some searching through the EIP standards but didn\u2019t see much. As a reference, here is my solidity code with an early implementation of this idea: GitHub - Bschuster3434/Comrade-Token: Open Source Repository for the Automatically Redistributing Comrade Token Here\u2019s an example of what this looks like on Polygon: Contract Address 0x70e4a39e46695c42f5dd7821b3c32af4b4a8253a | PolygonScan Any thoughts for feedback would be appreciated.

My preference would be that your wallet would let you know what exactly you\u2019re paying up front before the fee is sent. We don\u2019t have anything that resembles this today, which is why a standard on how fees are paid would be a logical first step to allow for transparency. \u201cAnd, 1% is a lot\u201d The fee, of course, is arbitrary. It can be a flat fee on all transactions. It can be progressive, regressive or flat. But I have to imagine if you\u2019re using this token (given how many choices you have in payment), you would only be using this token if you had some reason to want to support the community these funds are being distributed to. Thank you for your feedback! ",
