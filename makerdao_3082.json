                    "content": "Proposal: MakerDAO should pay to have three different technology stacks underpinning three different Maker Oracle Clients by paying for the development of two more. Motivation: Maker Oracle Client implements an off-chain protocol for use by oracle providers chosen by MakerDAO. It is a temporary scaling solution until Ethereum is fast and cheap enough to use exclusively.  Until then, multiple oracle client implementations provide for MakerDAO the kind of robustness assurances that Ethereum gains from multiple, independent Ethereum client implementations comprising the network. The scale of the Dai Credit System increasingly justifies the security afforded by client diversity.  Additionally, MakerDAO cannot expect the current client implementation to be maintained indefinitely by the entity which engineered and maintains it, the Maker Foundation, which is dissolving. Pros: MakerDAO gains diverse capabilities to execute oracle function Reduce MakerDAO reliance on off-chain software implementation Reduce chance a software bug can cause oracle network failure MakerDAO engaging additional Engineers MakerDAO prepares for Maker Foundation dissolution Cons: Oracle Feed Providers must select which client to use Increased opportunity for Maker Oracle Client bugs Engineering and maintenance cost Cost: Unknown but presumably the financial impact to MakerDAO of funding the engineering time needed to implement the oracle specification using two new, different technology stacks is low compared to MakerDAO\u2019s current and future scale. Summary: For the same reason that multiple Ethereum Beacon Chain clients were funded to create a robust network, so should MakerDAO ensure that as it scales past a billion Dai outstanding, no software bug can disrupt Maker Oracle functioning. Shorter Summary: Three high quality clients protect against an oracle client software black swan affecting one.     Agree Disagree Abstain     0 voters     Poll closes 2021-01-06T00:00:00.000Z ",
