                    "content": "There is a large opportunity to promote sybil resistence in the web3 ecosystem that I believe that Gitcoin is uniquely positioned to help with.  Why this matters By promoting sybil resistence (sockpuppet account resistence), we could move the ecosystem from 1-person-1-vote or 1-cpu-1-vote systems to 1-human-1-vote systems.  This unlocks  quadratic funding quadratic voting Gini coefficient measurements UBI one-person-one-vote DAOs data collectives sybil resistant airdrops & other use cases we haven\u2019t discovered yet!   How can Gitcoin help Gitcoin Grants is the largest Quadratic Funding application in the web3 space. The primary goal of Gitcoin Grants is to fund public goods. But if you look at it from a certain angle, because Gitcoin Grants requires sybil resistance, Gitcoin Grants is actually a giant red team / blue team exercise for battle testing Digitally Native Sybil Resistance technologies. Gitcoin Grants processes over $5mm/quarter in funding for the web3 space, and the sybil resistance baked into your Grants experience combined with the data scale is what enables Gitcoin to help create innovations here.  The Sybil Flywheel at Gitcoin. Altogether I think the sybil flywheel at Gitcoin looks like this:  Screen Shot 2021-12-13 at 9.04.04 AM1762\u00d71162 207 KB  More scale begets more mechanisms & more data, which combined with the FDD workstream\u2019s data intelligence creates more intelligence.  Governance curation creates more legitimacy that enables more scale.  & the cycle repeats. What I think is super interesting is the possibility that we could one day export the sybil resistence created on Gitcoin to the rest of the ecosystem via something like a decentralized version of Proof Of Personhood Passport - basically enabling dApps to see how sybil resistence a user is in 1 API call.  Having such a tool would (1) provide more utility for GTC & (2) be a public good for the ecosystem insofar as it would allow us to easily create more  1-human-1-vote systems. ",

As much as if not more than grants 2.0 (though arguably dpopp is part of Grants 2.0 product suite). Sybil resistence = a VERY foundational money lego this affects how i think about staffing. increasingly thinking, we may want an active devrel campaign around both grants registry AND dpopp. This has got me thinking further about this flywheel and starting to add governance utility to it as dPOPP rolls out\u2026 Here is a 100k foot view of what a GTC staking game could look like on top of dpopp:  Screen Shot 2022-05-25 at 4.33.06 PM1152\u00d7674 174 KB  What is really exciting to me is how this personhood staking could extend the virtuous flywheel above.  To that end, I made an interactive diagram for this for dpopp using loopy that shows how this creates more utility for users + also governance utility. Check it out here.  Would appreciate input from others about how to support this virtuous flywheel.  Especially those working on dpopp ( @kyle @brent @erich ) What would have to be true to get  more users higher personhood scores more dapps more governance utility  on top of dPOPP? ",
