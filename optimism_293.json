Unclear Project description (please explain how your project works)**:**Paparuda is a DAO, an NFT project and a Token (RAIN). Every day, a new Cloud NFT is generated from scientific data used to simulate clouds.  This cloud is put on auction (following the \u201cNouns\u201d model).  The proceeds from the sale go towards the treasury of the \u201cPaparuDAO\u201d, a DAO that is composed of NFT holders, project leads, and an advisory board made of scientist and legal experts.  Every month, the DAO has to spend a certain percentage of its treasury on a subset of projects : 1.Lobby to give clouds an legal status 2.Producing artworks/exhibitions to raise awareness around the importance of clouds in our hydric future 3.Providing support to people in hydric stress/drought areas. When the cloud NFT was generated from meteorological data, it was assigned a certain amount of water in its composition.  If the owner of the NFT does not want to use the NFT as access to the DAO, they can \u201cmake it rain\u201d and redeem RAIN tokens in direct correlation to the amount of water in the cloud.  The cloud is then re-assigned to the DAO to be sold on the secondary market. RAIN token supply will be directly correlated to the total amount of water in the atmosphere (about 130million cubic meters - hence 130 million tokens).  Initial token valuation will be driven by the price of water as a commodity on the day of token genesis. Project links:  Website:https://paparuda.cloud  Twitter:@paparudao  Please include all other relevant links below:White paper   Additional team member info (please link): Nicolas Wierinck (parallel.art) Maxime Berthou Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: We have contributed to a variety of projects, but few in the crypto space.  Nicolas Wierinck and myself have startedparallel.art, an advisory for artists with no technical backgrounds to engage meaningfully with the web3 space Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):N/A Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link)**:**N/A Is/will this project be open sourced? *In the future Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism : TBD, aiming for early 2023 depending on funding Ideal timeline is ->Receive funding late October/Early November ->Development of Cloud art, DAO constitution, Website dev, Smart Contract Dev through January 2023 ->Token launch January 2023 ->DAO launch and advisory board proposal framework early February 2023 ->First NFT auction late February 2023 Ecosystem Value Proposition We believe that people beyond the web3 space need to understand the value of operating in a \u201ccryptoeconomic\u201d fashion when it comes to public goods.  Deploying a similar project outside of the web3 field would require endless weeks of administrative jockeying, red tape, legal fees, accounting fees etc. Once it is stood up, the project will allow a subset of people who are not already engaged in the crypto space to understand how incentives can be deployed to make art and engagement work hand in hand with self and public interest.  Doing this on Optimism makes sense because of the ground level commitment to public goods, the deep connection with Ethereum (and thus ease of transaction).  We hope that this project will raise awareness to OP\u2019s mission as well as to the need for harnessing the power and beauty of clouds for the greater good. What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem? More users ? How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem? Engaging with people who are not yet onboarded to crypto and onramping them through Optimism Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem? 1/Larger externalities : if we take the concept of \u201cpublic goods\u201d to mean something beyond the blockchain ecosystem, we can see the idea of doing good as a general positive for humanity, and if this efforts emanates from a project running on Optimism, it directly ties optimism to this effort. Blockchains won\u2019t grow beyond the existing \u201cbelievers\u201d if we all only focus on the growth of blockchain ecosystems themselves 2/Userbase growth : if we engage with our supporters by running the project on Optimism, we are encouraging people who maybe never used crypto to start with Optimism and lean about the ecosystem, and in consequence about the vision and ideas that fuel it. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?  N/A Number of OP tokens requested:100,00 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount? N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? N/A Proposal for token distribution: Please see the tokenomic section of our white paper as it is quite specific to the project architecture The initial amount we are requesting will be broken down in -Cloud NFT development with our chosen partner (currently hoping to confirm Onformative) : Estimate 100k Euros.  This is the core element we need to get in place to be able to continue our fundraising.  Listed below are the other parts that we can build in the background while we create the core asset that will build the treasury.  -Website Development : Estimate 20k Euros -Smart Contract Development for NFTs, DAO and Tokens : Estimate 60 k Euros -Dapp Development for website : Estimate 20k Euros -Marketing & PR costs : Estimate 10k Euros for 2 months.  We are hoping to engage the folks from Digital Counsel -Travel costs to present the project at conferences/panels : Estimate 15k -Expenses for core team : Estimate 20k between Parallel and Maxime Berthou Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability: One idea would be to put the funds in a multisig wallet.  Every transaction would have to be signed by both a member of our team and a member of the OP Foundation. The only issue I foresee is that in some cases the vendors we have to pay would not take tokens and conversion to fiat would have to happen (which will be a taxable event for us, at about 15% since we are based in Belgium).  Not sure what other means of accountability could exist that that stage, but we are thinking of ways to ensure full trust and confidence in our fund distribution. ",

Role:  Gated. NFT voting rather than token, One wallet one NFT water management and art as a force for common good legal status for clouds financial support to hydric stress community  DAO treasury will contains different token (RAIN token along with stablecoin and token) RAIN token - Act as DAO token with distribution plan as below - 20% (team token, might be sold to investors) 10% DAO 10% community 60% Cloud bursting fund (NFTs) Additional information related to fund use could help.

                    "content": "Hello @OPUser !  Thanks for the summary. If I may, I\u2019ll make a small correction : Cloud Token The NFT that is created daily is assigned a value in RAIN (based on the simulated water amount in the cloud) but that value in RAIN remains latent unless the buyer of the NFT decides to \u201cmake it RAIN\u201d.  At that point the mechanics are that  Rain Tokens are taken from the DAO\u2019s \u201cCloud Bursting\u201d fund 90% of the water value in RAIN is given to the NFT holder The NFT is transferred to the DAO who can now sell it on the secondary market to prospective buyers, but the cloud will be \u201cRAIN-less\u201d at that point.  The idea is that the Cloud Bursting fund should be large enough to avoid a concerted cloud bursting event from all NFT holders (which seems unlikely since we are releasing a single cloud a day and it will take a long time for anyone to gather enough clouds to threaten the fund). The initial value of the Cloud NFT is not tied to the value in Water, but it purely driven by the auction. In other words, if you are lucky, you could buy a Cloud NFT for a value that is lower than its value in RAIN. I hope that helps clarify. Regarding the use of the funds from the grant, I\u2019ve integrated them in the original grant proposal post, but in short they are  NFT asset creation from real world cloud data Smart contract development and DAPP development Web Dev PR/Marketing efforts Expenses for Core team (travel to conferences and other opportunities to present the project).

I deeply value the creativity of the team and I trust that they believe in the project and won\u2019t be exposed to harm their reputation. Unfortunately, we have seen for years how everyone was able to create NFTs and call it art, different projects were selling parcels of the earth\u2019s land, tokenomics expecting to be sustainable going to zero, etc. The team can be a scammer, ignorant, or just have bad luck and be in the wrong moment, but we have seen this crash too many times. So it is impossible for some people reading your WP not to think about this. Strengths  It can be an opportunity to start working on public good funding as we are looking forward to doing in Optimism. As @OPUser noticed. It can be a way to include scholars and researchers from different fields to see beyond the fiat-incentivized academy we all researchers know about (this is something I strongly believe we should work on) As you said: It will bring no coiners to the ecosystem (I won\u2019t stop saying that and I have posted about it recently)  Weaknesses   Tokenomics and its unnecessary complex design: It\u2019s not going to work and at this time, nobody with some knowledge of the ecosystem would believe it either (I think @DrChaos.eth is expressing that thought)  Funds location: As funds are located and taking into account the tokenomics, this project doesn\u2019t benefit the OP ecosystem at all as @jrocki.eth and @MoneyManDoug pointed out. As they say: Don\u2019t trust, verify.  Suggestions Here are some thoughts. This is a very complex matter and we are still learning about it. I think tokenomics can be redesigned without sacrificing the beauty of the idea behind it.  WP describes a pool to give liquidity to the rain token (unnecessary), it speculates with a growing market value (wishful thinking and not very realistic) We really need here the alignment of incentives between the team and OP community so my suggestion is: Rain token it\u2019s a beautiful idea, but if it\u2019s in a liquidity pool it\u2019s exposed to all kinds of problems, if we are not gambling about Elon musk buying some rain, then we need to be realistic and remove that idea. There is a liquid token called OP, and we in the OP community must think about the long-term sustainability of the OP economy. This is something that everyone misses (even bitcoiners with BTC). I suggest Rain token could be minted by using OP token (with the same idea using the market value of water) going to the Paparuda DAO treasure and the DAO could be contributing to OP ecosystem by being an active part of it as OP holder. You also say in WP that the currency to buy NFT Clouds is TBD. Same here: OP, so you also contribute to OP economy. And when DAO needs funds and needs to sell OP at the market, RAIN will be burned. We need devs help here but this smart contract system for minting and burning a token has been done many times. And if OP funds are going to implement some contracts for this project to do that, I suggest it must be open-sourced so other projects on OP could adapt it as well.  I look forward to getting of Pararuda and OP community, and It\u2019d be for me a pleaser keep exploring this ideas with all of you ",

As far as I could research there are some public artists and researchers on the team and as advisors (someone else should look into it and verify). I think value can be created by people buying NFT from known artists and knowing there are some real social impact contributions. This sounds like a charity selling art to fund public goods. But, here\u2019s where crypto must do its magic and be more open so it can be a game-changer. How? We need to figure it out. My feeling is by being open to other artists and scientists to participate, and by allowing a community like OP could be the curators who control that all the agents are acting fairly. Not easy at all, that\u2019s why we are here I think.

So my suggestion was that the RAIN token doesn\u2019t have to have a liquidity pool to start. Imagine this: RAIN is an ERC-20 token, that is minted when anyone makes rain by \u201cemptying a Cloud\u201d when doing that the calculated value on the OP token goes into the treasure. If someone wants to sell a RAIN token, they won\u2019t do it on the market, but burn it first and receive the OP value and then go and sell the OP if they want to liquid its investment. People are free to create liquidity for RAIN if they want to, and market value would be dependent on the OP value you can get by burning plus the value of belonging to the Paparuda DAO, this would be lost if you burn it.

                    "content": "Thanks a lot @TheDoctor and @OPUser for your feedback.  This is extremely valuable. Despite having worked in the field for about two years, we are not as well versed in tokenomics as I\u2019m sure people in this public space are, so excuse some elements of ignorance, but I will try to answer as precisely as possible. 1/Regarding the weakness of the tokenomics, for us the idea is less to create a token that can become purely a store of value, but to create, as much as possible, a sort of circular economy around the PaparuDAO.  Having the RAIN token as an asset that can, with success, expand our ability to fund projects, but also creates a value incentive around the NFTs that has multiple outcomes (access to DAO - resale - conversion to RAIN) 2/Regarding the Funds location, I tried to explain in a different post how we hope to benefit the OP ecosystem.  If the project is 100% built on OP (NFTs are minted on OP, Token is minted on OP, sales are done in OP etc) we are hopefully creating value beyond the short term financial value for the blockchain, but I will skip this as you provide your own suggestions, which are extremely useful. Suggestion 1 : My lack of depth in DeFi knowledge is maybe the problem here, but without liquidity, how does on sell the token?  If you bought an NFT, decided to make it RAIN and then want to swap your RAIN for ETH or USDC, how would you do it without liquidity pools? However, if what you are suggesting is that we can mint on OP and thus OP acts as the liquidity, then that\u2019s problem solved IMHO. (PS : I just saw your answer below about the burning mechanism as I was typing this) And yes, Clouds would be minted on OP, sold in OP. Finally, yes, open sourcing everything is key.  We do mention at the end of the WP that if this works, this model could be applied to many other intangible or tangible public goods.  That is our ultimate end goal. To @OPUser , regarding value, again, if monetary value is what is expected, then the value could be purely in having the entire project function within the OP ecosystem, but we are NOT planning on making \u201cprofits\u201d for example.  All the money generated has to go to fund the team, fund proposals and maintain the overall project.  We are open to suggestions here of course. To @TheDoctor , yes, our current core team is made of Maxime Berthou, Nicolas Wierinck and myself.  Advisory board is currently made of Fabienne Quiller\u00e9-Majzoub , Christelle Barthe, Mathieu Simonet and we are hoping to add a water management expert, Dirk Halet And to @OPUser and @TheDoctor the problem with platforms like the ones you mention is that they don\u2019t really help us with a fundamental aspect of this project. What we are trying to do is to use the fundamental levers, incentive structures and verticals of Web3 (NFTs, DAOs, Tokens) to build a parallel economy that exists for the simple purpose of advancing a cause.  The only way we can do this is with the support of an ecosystem of experts, thinkers, supporters, and advisors.  For example, we haven\u2019t started writing our governance ideas for the DAO yet, and that will be something that hopefully sets an example as to how other DAOs interested in doing similar things can operate.  If the OP ecosystem supports us, and brings us knowledge, expertise and advice, this process will be of use to more than just us.  We don\u2019t want to just take some grant money and then go hide in a corner to build, we hope to build together. I hope this helps shed some light, I\u2019m standing by to provide any further clarity ",

Tokenomics is a new thing and we need to learn from all mistakes and problems we are aware of and keep exploring ideas and experimenting.     alexczet:  for us the idea is less to create a token that can become purely a store of value, but to create, as much as possible, a sort of circular economy around the PaparuDAO. Having the RAIN token as an asset that can, with success, expand our ability to fund projects, but also creates a value incentive around the NFTs that has multiple outcomes (access to DAO - resale - conversion to RAIN)   I get the idea, but we have learned from previous projects that you can imagine an economy expend money in developing a complex structure, marketing etc. Then reality is: market is down so you sell cheap to pay invoices , besides that you need to spend more money to defend your token price against selling pressure and finally people don\u2019t act as you expected. I would take a different approach. You can mint NFT Clouds, but you don\u2019t need a new platform to start, you can do it on the Quix app. to use open sourced code,  some DAO platform, and so on\u2026 If you save money there you can spend it on the important stuff: promoting research, art,  funding water related projects. For instance the DAO finds a place were they\u2019re having water supply problems and techs study and determinate that you can buy a new water pump and install it. You show that this model can work, solve the problems you find and readapt\u2026 You can use you\u2019re experience to advice on other projects, etc. There\u2019s no better marketing than that. As I said: we need to change the paradigm. We need to understand that in this model collaborate is better than compite. But we need to stop doing the same we do in old world.     alexczet:  For example, we haven\u2019t started writing our governance ideas for the DAO yet, and that will be something that hopefully sets an example as to how other DAOs interested in doing similar things can operate   That\u2019s what I mean, you don\u2019t need to create all that from scrach: there are some DAOs working on it that can teach us so much about it. So focus in your strengths and listen to the community about the other stuff. ",

One thing that has maybe gotten lost in this conversation is that this is an art project.  Finding ourselves on a platform with PFPs and Collectibles would not really help us create a clear message.  Having a custom website where all the elements around the cloud NFT can be clearly communicated, and other elements can be added over time is critical for us to be able to distinguish ourselves, and have a clear art direction and voice. Definitely see your point on everything else. Thanks again ",

There is one thing I\u2019m a bit unclear on : we have received the question multiple times about \u201cHow does this create value for the OP ecosystem?\u201d Maybe one thing to clarify is if these grants are for \u201cpublic goods\u201d or for \u201cThe OP ecosystem growth\u201d.  There might be a bit of a contradiction to ask projects such as ours to receive funds in exchange for a commitment to help the OP ecoystem vs help a larger subset of humanity. Maybe it is a vocabulary thing, but in my mind that kind of commitment is more of an investment rather than a grant?  In other words, a grant sounds more like \u201cwe think you are doing something valuable and please keep on doing it\u201d and an investment sounds like \u201cwe like what you are doing, but we need ROI, so please make sure you integrate that in your mission\u201d This is not a criticism of the grant concept, more of a question around how proposals should be thought of and developed, and I personally walked in here very unschooled, so I\u2019m just sharing what I absorbed from this process as a bit of feedback, hopefully not something to be perceived as a negative.

This does not mean that all grants must be incentive programs.

Governance funds should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables.
