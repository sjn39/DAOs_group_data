During the last 12 months we were balancing between (USDT, USDC, DAI) it was a must-have for the DEX to raise up, but for now when we have $13M in liquidity pools and $25M+ in trading volume we feel that we are strong enough to start the transition. Before we start a campaign about this, I wanted to collect feedback from you guys, to understand of what is okay, and what should be improved. Here is some more info about who we are and what we do:  About pDEX  \u2192  Liquidity and trading data \u2192  About trust-less setup \u2192   Our goal is to maintain at least $5M in DAI liquidity pool and reduce slippage for DAI <> BTC & DAI <> XMR swaps. Find more about the new rates below.   Incognito \u2013 9 Jul 20    Provide Provide liquidity to the first privacy-protecting DEX, and earn rewards for helping people trade with freedom.

High yield mining incentives have historically been good at attracting liquidity. Safety and simplicity are larger road blocks for me. Not to say there is anything dangerous looking about your project, but being in the privacy space I assume you and your customers would agree: suspicious until proven otherwise. Off the bat, not being able to use metamask makes you more complicated than pretty much all other DeFi apps. Add on to this the incognito bridge and other chains, there\u2019s a lot going on. Two questions for you:  why would someone use this over tornado.cash for private transactions? are private swaps needed? what\u2019s wrong with privately funding an account with ETH->swapping to DAI on uniswap?

With 13% and our target of 5M in the liquidity pool, we could make it sustainable for the long run.     hyman:  but being in the privacy space I assume you and your customers would agree: suspicious until proven otherwise.   Yep, you are right 100%, we try to do all activity publicly.     hyman:  Off the bat, not being able to use metamask makes you more complicated than pretty much all other DeFi apps.   Thats useful feedback, we are going to launch a tool in January that wraps Metamask and allows you to use Incognito mode for Metamask itself and other Ethereum based Dapps. I Will keep you posted about the progress.     hyman:   why would someone use this over tornado.cash for private transactions?    Let me try to answer with an example. I assume you browse hundreds of websites daily. If there a particular website you don\u2019t want to keep track of in-browser history you can manually remove such record (as use tornado to anonymize a particular transaction) or you can turn incognito mode on your browser and surf around without leaving a trace (as use Incognito mode for your crypto) Here is a very quick comparison just to show the main difference      Incognito Tornado     Implementation off-chain on-chain   Shielding fee one time each time   Anonymity set Ring CT, Confidential Assets mixing TXs   Waiting period \u2248 5-10m (upon TX confirmation) Might take days (depends on volume)   Amount limitations No limitation (from $0.1 to $100M+) 100, 1000 DAI     I don\u2019t want to say that Incognito is better or worse than Tornado we just build different features       hyman:   are private swaps needed? what\u2019s wrong with privately funding an account with ETH->swapping to DAI on uniswap?    It\u2019s a good question. If we compare raw data on Incognito  image1196\u00d7334 31 KB  Uniswap  image1414\u00d7364 53.3 KB       Uniswap Incognito Difference     Liquidity $1.6B $17M 94 times   Volume $200M $200k 1000 times    Obviously, the differences in liquidity pools and trading volume are not comparable   btw, we just launched Incognito mode for Uniswap \u2014>  On another side If you compare trading volume Incognito with Bisq - the most known privacy DEX, you will see     Average daily volume Bisq Incognito     Jan 2020 $150k+ $5k+   Jun 2020 $200k+ $50k+   Dec 2020 $180k+ $200k +    Our bet DeFi industry growth rate is more than 10x in 2020. We believe that if DeFi and crypto does continue eat the world there will be a real shift in thinking towards privacy. It will be more convenient to use a privacy wallet than to generate a new ETH address or use a mixer each time you would like to make a transaction. More on our bet \u2014> ",
