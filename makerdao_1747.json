So since our listing is free we take approval from (Founders, Core Contributor, Moderators, and Marketing Teams). Yes this is a weird ask because we are asking for permission in a permissionless web3, but we feel it is the right thing to do before we use an organization\u2019s logo/mission statement on the site. Has any other site asked you for this (probably not). However, if Maker DAO approved this you have a POC to talk too and I would too. Instead of pulling API\u2019s I am walking the walk and reaching out to DAOs 1 by 1. We have done this for 236+ DAOs and counting (so it works!!) and we are trying to focus on relationships. It is tough for sure, and others might disagree with the tactics, but it differentiates us. So in this specific case you are designated as a \u201cGovernance Core unit Team\u201d. We could take your approval, or if you think this would have to go for a proposal vote by the DAO that would be okay too. I understand if you might not be comfortable with making that decision alone. From my personal perspective, I was asked by one of your community members to post here. We want approval from a (Founders, Core Contributor, Moderators, and Marketing Teams) before I use maker material.  As you can see from me being here this is not spam. I am honestly just trying to talk to people and go through the process (proposal or simple approval).  While I understand this ask is unusual simply tossing me to spam because its unusual doesn\u2019t seem to me to be appropriate, but as I said I am here just trying to follow up on one of your community\u2019s member\u2019s requests. No pressure to get listed just doing our due diligence. John ",
