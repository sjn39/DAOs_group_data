This proposal has been talked about in another thread but I don\u2019t remember the downsides. @MakerMan did you propose this?   Yeah I advocated this in connection with a secondary system surplus (or treasury) since then it breaks the primary system 1:1 DAI collateral backing but retains this as a \u2018governance\u2019 option to restore the 1:1 PEG by adding back the collateral in the treasury to the primary DAI redemptions in case of ES. In the loosest sense it is printing of unbacked DAI within the collateral of the primary system but if one adds in the collateral of the secondary surplus/treasury 1:1 \u2018should\u2019 be restored.    The problem with just buying collateral in the secondary surplus/treasury buffer is pricing risk.   I was talking about doing this with stablecoins so the pricing risk was minimal. I did also suggest this in connection with yield farming since in principle depositing DAI to get cDAI in compound has zero pricing risk, only liquidity risk which the system can easily take on. So yes as long as the underlying basically gives back DAI 1:1 I see no real issue with this and the protocol itself would earn. I point out that I suggested this for COMP simply because Maker getting into this game would lower returns overall for everyone else and governance could have drop kicked as much DAI as necessary to price out the farmers.   Pricing risk is zero, but liquidity and other risks would have had to been assessed.  In the end it would have given Maker governance a voting share of compound governance as well or just sold for MKR and the MKR burned or saved in the treasury. ",

But using M vaults more or less solve the capital base issue (if you have a cDAI-M vault 100% LR even the 3% of Compound can be 30-40% easily and you push compound farmers to curve quickly). Or have a yyCRV-M vault, but you can\u2019t have 100% LR then so you need a bit of capital. If my way to use vaults is convoluted, just think about keeping the system solvent while minting DAI.

                    "content": "I proposed something similar to this with uniswap tokens. I really like the idea of maker holding liquidity tokens. In line with what @rileyjt is saying, I think these vaults should be open to the public, but ALSO that the maker protocol itself should hold these tokens in reserves. They are the closest equivalent to treasury bills for the crypto market. Many of these tokens are fully decentralized and permissionless, they provide a yield, they have low volatility compared to the crypto market as a whole. They really are just about the perfectly optimal token to hold in reserve. Also there\u2019s a wide enough variety now that we can even optimize the amount of risk the protocol takes on within the realm of liquidity tokens alone. ",
