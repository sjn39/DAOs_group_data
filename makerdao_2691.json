Governance       Summary of the situation:  The Maker community continues to search for quality collateral assets which can be added to stimulate DAI supply, ease pressure on the DAI peg, and generate liquidity and revenue for the protocol. Some of the new collateral types added since Black Thursday have been successful at this (e.g. USDC-A, WBTC-A which have 40mm and 46mm DAI outstanding against them, respectively), while others were underwhelming (e.g. KNC, ZRX, and MANA which collectively issue just over 500k\u2026     ",

One question that came up for me that I didn\u2019t get unfortunately in the meeting due to time, that I\u2019d love to have @Primoz or @williamr weigh in on: We talked about the merits of spending time to onboard large-cap crypto assets, specifically about how much DAI they can generate and whether that\u2019s worth it over focusing on RWA which might take longer to get on but can generate much more DAI. What we never discussed is the ongoing \u201cmaintenance overheada\u201d of a relatively large number of crypto assets for the domain teams. If we were to add 20 more crypto assets such as ZRX or MANA, how much more time do the different domain teams need to spend on managing those? There must be token upgrades, migrations, changing market situations etc. that will need to be monitored? I think this could potentially make it even harder for the community to onboard RWA assets.     Planet_X:  As the Domain Teams Risk, Oracles and Smart Contracts are not set up to handle legal issues, these issues should possibly be left for the community to decide by vote instead of further increasing the load on the domain teams. At least until a Legal domain team is in place.   I agree, it\u2019s a topic that we shouldn\u2019t forget or ignore but what you propose is a good way forward that I think will avoid us getting completely gridlocked until such a domain team is in place.

On Risk side we intend to automize monitoring of risk exposures for crypto assets as much as possible, use a bit more pragmatic approach (use complex quantitative models only for larger collateral assets) and focus mostly on those important metrics that are needed as inputs for continuous evaluation of appropriate debt ceiling and risk premiums. There will be some more work initially, but this will be strongly beneficial in the mid to long run for us. ",
