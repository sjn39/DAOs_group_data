Lead Application  There is currently an open application process for the Council Lead. The Lead will work closely with top delegates and play an integral administrative and operational role in S3. The Foundation has pre-emptively started the application process as filing this role will help set the Council up for success. If you\u2019re interested in applying to be the Council Lead, please read more about the role and apply here! Applications must be submitted by January 11th at 19:00 GMT.  Reviewer Elections  A total of 8 Reviewers will be elected by the Token House. Those that would like to nominate themselves for these roles must fill out the below template and post here by January 11th at 19:00 GMT . There is no minimum voting power requirement to be a Reviewer.   Council Reviewer Self-Nomination Template  Please keep your answers as concise as possible while conveying all relevant information. Council sub-committee: (Builders or Growth Experiments) If you are a delegate, please provide the link to your delegate commitment: If you are a delegate, please indicate what % of votable supply is delegated to you: (voting power can be referenced here) If you are a delegate, please indicate your voting participation rate in OP governance to date: (You may link to your profile on Karma, if applicable. If not, you can divide the number of Optimism votes under your Snapshot profile by 87, which is the number of Token House votes through Season 2.) Please link to your voting history and any voting rationale you\u2019ve shared: (You may link to your Snapshot profile for voting history. You may link to your delegate communication thread, or any other medium you use to communicate with your delegators, to share your voting rationale.) Please outline any other contributions to the Optimism ecosystem to date: Do you have a technical background? If so, please elaborate: Did you serve on a committee in Season 2? If so, please specify which: Please demonstrate any experience you believe is relevant to this role: Please demonstrate expertise relevant to your Council sub-committee: Please describe your philosophy on what makes a good Governance Fund grant: What types of grant applications would you like to see or what RFPs would you create? This should incorporate your view on what the Optimism ecosystem needs to prioritize right now Please disclose any anticipated conflicts of interest: Please verify that you agree to abide by the delegate code of conduct: Yes Please verify that you understand KYC will be required to receive Council rewards at the end of Season 3: Yes Please verify that you are able to commit 12 hours / week to reviewing grant applications and other Council operations: Yes  Reviewers will be elected via a Snapshot vote in Special Voting Cycle #9b. These Snapshot votes will be Approval Votes, wherein each delegate would be able to vote for as many nominees as they see fit, for each Council sub-committee, with equal voting power. The nominees with the highest percentage of approval votes will be elected to the Council. While the code of conduct stipulates that delegates may not vote on their own candidacy in elections, in the case of approval/ranked choice votes, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions. Example: I can vote for my own candidacy on the Growth Experiments committee, so long as I also cast 4 additional votes (a total of 5 votes, as there are 5 open positions on the sub-committee.) Self-nominations need to be posted here by 1/11/23. Special Voting Cycle #9b will run according to the above procedure from 1/12/23-1/18/23. Season 3 will begin on January 26th.  ",
