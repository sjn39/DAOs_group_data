I coordinated with the auditor to make sure cumulated and unused DAI is returned to the DAO regularly, as always communicated.  766\u00d774 13.4 KB  See transaction link I believe the financial markets, including crypto, have moved to a risk-off bias since early 2022 and will continue to do so throughout the year while monetary policy and financial conditions adjust. This is likely to impact revenue generation and the DAO\u2019s ability to generate positive cashflows as risky assets are deleveraged. With the new onboardings, while RWA originated revenue are easily forecasted to surpass 4.5M/year within the next 12 months, bringing the benefit/cost of the RWF CU upwards of 200%, I still believe budgetary matters are a shared burden in the DAO. I acknowledge the DAO is going to navigate through some short term budgetary constraints during this time and Core Units have a role to play to mitigate its effects. I have managed our budget prudently and responsibly and made every possible effort to keep actuals well below forecast. For the benefit of the DAO, our return of excess funds reflects that view. As a facilitator, I believe we are more like trustees than owners of the budget and therefore have responsibility with financial prudence for entrusted funds. Despite the current environment and the difficulty of this topic, I continue to believe in such voluntary actions by fair-minded mandated actors. Moving forward, I\u2019ll continue to play my part with financial restraint as much as possible during this challenging time for the DAO. Kind regards, Will ",

In the setup of the RWF-001 dssVest, there is an intermediary auditor wallet (SES managed) between the CU Ops wallet and the protocol, called the auditor. More on this here. The CU forecasts monthly a 3-month expected budget and benchmarks the actuals against forecasts. The auditor only pulls funds from the dssVest if there is an actual need. If actuals come well below forecasts that means dssVest keeps cumulating funds but if there is no expectation, based on forecasts, that those funds will be necessary then the auditor essentially can return excess funds back to the protocol treasury. That\u2019s what happened here. ",

                    "content": "@Aes Thanks for your post. Let me provide some enlightenment.     Aes:  This post is missing some context - RWF just drew $2.6M a couple days before this \u2018return\u2019.   Return here is an actual return, no quotation marks (\u201c\u201d). I\u2019d advise you to familiarise yourself with how the DssBlow contract works as well as with item 7 of the monthly top up cycle under my budget:    MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001)   Auditor Wallet Returns \u2013 The Auditor Wallet signers will return any amount of DAI above 2x the Monthly Budget Cap. The Auditor Wallet, using the DssBlow contract described here , will return the excess DAI directly to the surplus buffer.       Aes:  After this return, RWF still has $1.55M in their operational wallet and $625K in their auditor wallet, for a total of $2.2M.   The Ops Wallet indeed still has 1.55M DAI. There is an additional ~744K DAI that will be returned to the auditor wallet from the Ops Wallet. And then from there further returned to treasury. You can familiarise yourself looking under RWF CU latest monthly report. That will bring the total returned DAI to the treasury to an even higher than the 1.99M DAI announced. It makes me even prouder to say that.   Regarding the remainder in the auditor wallet, I\u2019ll advise you to familiarise yourself with section 7 again of the budget mip, at your convenience.    MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001)   As such, the Auditor Wallet will then hold up to 2x the Monthly Budget Cap at the start of the month, allowing DssVest to stream DAI up to the Quarterly Budget Cap over the course of the month.   As for what remains on the Ops Wallet for runaway needs, I\u2019ll advise you familiarise yourself with section 3 of the monthly top-up cycle:    MIP40c3-SP61: Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001)   Returning Excess Funds \u2013 RWF-001 creates and signs any transactions for excess funds that should be returned to the Auditor Wallet:  Excess DAI Transactions \u2013 DAI transactions for Operational Wallets that have a balance above the 3-Month Budget Forecast will be returned to the Auditor Wallet.    Now that we covered my actions, meaning upwards of 2M DAI voluntarily returned to the treasury, with no dramas. My conscience is clean as I know how I am contributing to improving the bottom-line with concrete actions. I self-imposed the RWF CU a ~50% budget cut. What about SFCU? Are you doing your part to the shared pain? If so, how? Prove it with actions, not words. I see no returns registered in makerburn.com, only budget increase requests. ",
