This amendment also brings some minor typo fixes to MIP55c1 and MIP55c2.  Amended MIPs and Components  Paragraph Summary  Clarified amount of Dai needed for MIP55c3 subproposals to enter the Weekly/Monthly Cycle. This was done by specifically clarifying that SPF requests for 50k or less may go into the Weekly Cycle, and requests for more than 50k must go through the Monthly Governance Cycle (providing the feedback period has been fullfilled).   MIP55c1: Special Purpose Fund Requirements  Typo fixes.   MIP55c2: Special Purpose Fund Process  Typo fixes.   MIP55c3: Adding/Modifying a Special Purpose Fund  Clarified amount of Dai needed for MIP55c3 subproposals to enter the Weekly/Monthly Cycle. Feedback Period distinction was made for subproposals requesting 50k Dai or less.
