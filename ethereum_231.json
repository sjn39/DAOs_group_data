I posted a sharing friendly update on the Council of Prague landing page here with the full details:   Ethereum Community Events \u2013 2 Aug 18    Council of Prague The Council of Prague is the third gathering of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians. It is being held before DevCon4.      Call for Volunteers I also want to officially have a call for volunteers. Thanks to @tjayrush who forced me to do a write up of what was going to be needed. Sponsor Outreach Develop a write up on why / how sponsors can sponsor, make a list of all the organizations, and email / follow up to see who wants to sponsor Agenda Gardener Someone to wrangle the agenda ahead of time; probably also outreach to get other people in gear and organized, such as ring makers. We think we\u2019re going to have one full day and up to 3 separate spaces. How do we run both an unconference track as well as help ring makers get chunks of time to dig into specific EIPs or topics. Volunteer lead Organize people who will volunteer over a couple of days on the ground; there is lots more to do here as well, such as helping people get setup with forum accounts, using HackMD for real time note taking, interviewing people in person about what they care about / what EIPs are great, and so on Marketing / communication Outreach to people who should attend, messaging on Twitter, active recruiting of core Ethereum people and adjacent projects and allies I (@boris) couldn\u2019t help but stay involved organizing, so I\u2019m sticking my hand up to help run budgets, ticketing & registration, and the operations bits of sponsorship.  If you\u2019re interested in getting involved and helping out in any way, including if you\u2019re a ring maker and want to get some feedback on how to plan, please join the first call (and leave questions / comments below if you\u2019re attending / what you might want to help with). When: Sept 5th, 8AM - 9AM PST (might go a little longer) Where: Google Meet https://meet.google.com/wbr-tfxe-oyg Stay tuned for more news and official opening of registration this week. ",

I am completely new to the fellowship of ethereum magicians and have only followed from the sidelines so far, but I would love to finally get involved and help. I am curious to learn more on how you want to approach sponsorships. I feel \u201cdonations\u201d would be more appropriate, as companies should ideally not use this as a platform to promote themselves but rather see it as a donation for the greater good of ethereum. But I\u2019m sure this was considered already. Currently I\u2019m part of the ethberlin core organizing team and would love to use my experience from there to help organize the fellowship gathering in prague. I will join the call, if that\u2019s okay! ",
