Delegate to me your votes and I will only use it for one single purpose: Activation of the protocol fee switch and nothing else. Call to action:    app.uniswap.org    Uniswap Interface       Input: 0x481d2FebcC60eEb28cfA48259187f12d876Dc50E Twitter: @UniswapHero Page: None yet, but community member can make a page that shows current delegated votes and any proposals that I have done. Reasons why as Uni token holders we want to do this:  The switch allows governance to divert 0.05% of all swap fees to where ever Uniswap Governance decides. This delegation will not get into the politics of where that money should go and how it will be spent. Control over the Uniswap fee switch is subject to a 180 day time lockdelay. Let\u2019s not waste time. Activating it doesn\u2019t mean we HAVE to do something with it. We can just choose NOT to divert the funds from the swap fees, but at least we will have the option. 1% of UNI total supply (delegated) to submit a governance proposal. 1 million votes are required to submit proposal. 4% of UNI (4 million) supply required to vote \u2019yes\u2019 to reach quorum. The development team purposely designed the protocol fee switch as a community governance issue because of legal issues, so they are UNLIKELY to vote on this issue. This is up to us as a community to make this happen.   Maths Uniswap is averaging $500,000,000 in volume a day for the past month. $500,000,000 * .3% = $1,500,000 or $1.5 million per day Protocol Fee Switch $500,000,000 * .05% = $250,000 or $250k per day If governance decided to divert these funds to UNI token holders (Not saying we should do this). In 180 days there will be approximately 450 million UNI tokens and if we assume that Uniswap does not grow in fee volume: $250,000 / 450,000,000 = $0.000556 per day per UNI Approximately $0.203 per year per UNI token ",

The litigation risk discussed here seems nebulous (unsure how a specific countries laws could be applied to a decentralized group of token holders).  The only con I can see with this is that it would eat in to LP profits. That being said, historical liquidity providers are UNI holders  / have been granted a large share of UNI.  This change could appreciate the price of their stack of UNI, since it gives UNI a new dimension of value and potentially a profit-flow for holders.  UNI sentiment is very low due to their being no clear use case for holding the token.  This protocol fee switch is a compelling use case, it basically allows people to get exposure to Uniswap protocol fees without the risk of impermanent loss that come with being a liquidity provider. I agree that the least we should do is put this up for a vote.  Perhaps one of the hesitations is that people are unsure how the fee will be used, and perhaps need to know that before voting yes? FWIW I am in support of turning it on, and since there are 180 days until it activates, I think there is plenty of time to discuss how we can use the fee.  I am also curious to hear why people would be against this. ",

What qualifies you as an expert? Are you able to understand each societies moral and social dispositions? Do you even know who the \u201ccommunity\u201d is?   That is an extremely nuanced question and I\u2019m not saying I have any answers to it. I\u2019m not trying to sit on a high horse, I\u2019m giving my two cents from decades of community management and moderation. No matter how decentralized a system gets, it doesn\u2019t make the average user any more or less educated. It simply gives everyone a voice to vote (or delegate votes to someone) regardless of whether or not they or the delegate have the least bit of understanding on the subject at hand. While the idea that everyone\u2019s voice should hold equal weight in a governance system is a nice one, it\u2019s denying certain facts about human behavior: Most people (including delegates) will not \u201cDYOR\u201d, and will act on uninformed emotion instead of reason. Roles like the one you\u2019re filling are extremely valuable. I\u2019m simply pointing out the fact that a governance system isn\u2019t better just because it\u2019s decentralized if the knowledge/ignorance of the user base remains the same. ",

Greater liquidity = bigger volumes = more fees = incentive for UNI holders to incentivise liquidity. Think it\u2019s beyond obvious that the massive liquidity inflows were driven by the UNI token reward. People aren\u2019t going to stake ETH-USDT, etc in the volumes they are for a few percent annualised which is what would happen if you stripped the UNI reward from the pool. Not sure if you are overthinking this one or just haven\u2019t made the connections I have pointed out. Should have also been clear from the sushi vampire attack that UNI holders need to incentive liquidity providers. ",
