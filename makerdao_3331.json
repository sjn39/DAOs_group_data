Thanks @amyjung for raising the concern about our numbers appearing low. We\u2019ve also increased our budget for contingencies to 20,000 to be more prepared for potential legal fees if we end up needing to lean more heavily on our own council rather than the Legal Core Unit. That brings the total budget for the three months to 133124. ",
