Penn Blockchain throws their hat in the ring; check out their delegate platform presentation during the Meet Your Delegate Call happening April 13, 2022. The Maker forum is getting a navigational upgrade to improve user experience.  March\u2019s Financial Report is now up! Check it out.    News and Announcements Penn Blockchain Delegate Platform Penn Blockchain submits its platform as a Recognized Delegate. Summary Penn Blockchain is a student-run blockchain organization at The University of Pennsylvania with the objective to use its wide-ranging experience in crypto governance to help Maker make the best decisions for our protocol. Members are involved in governance initiatives for several popular protocols they have delegations for, including Aave, Compound, Uniswap, and DyDx. Proposal author @juanbug is internally working with MakerDAO to investigate on-chain strategies for increasing treasury and liquidity for Dai. Core Values  Broadcast Maker to not only Penn but also the greater university community Help Maker through its Layer-2 and cross-network integrations Advise and support Maker with treasury management initiatives Educate and teach students about the Maker project, expand its connections with university teams, and provide opportunities for future collaboration  Penn Blockchain will present their Delegate Platform during the Meet Your Delegate #11 public call on April 13 at 2022-04-13T19:30:00Z. Join the call here.  Financial Report 2022-03 The financial report for March 2022 is now available here. Summary Overall net protocol income was 2.7M DAI, down 44% from February and 69% from March 2021. Annualized ROE has remained stable at approximately 90%. Selected Observations  QoQ Recurring Net Protocol Income (rNPI) change of -4.8M DAI driven by a change in assets. MoM increase in workforce expenses driven by higher C.U. costs.  Caveat: We do not report workforce expenses on an accrual basis, so that some C.U.s will have a phasing issue, with higher expenses one month and none the next.   A P/B Ratio of 23.4x suggests that there is a lot of value expectation priced into MKR at current capitalization levels; for comparison\u2019s sake, Bank of America trades at ~1.2x and Citigroup at ~0.6x. The YoY ETH lending market contracted by 18%, but in this context, Aave took a large share, growing 35% to MKR\u2019s -33% and Compound\u2019s -42%. The WBTC lending market expanded 36% YoY, with Aave growing 250% to MKR\u2019s 80% after the last-minute loss of a key WBTC vault. DAI outstanding is slightly up to 9.5B DAI.   The Maker Brand Team The Growth Core Unit is requesting to develop a Maker Brand team to help market MakerDAO to a wider audience and better engage with existing users. Summary If approved, the Maker Brand team will first be incubated with the Growth Core Unit, after which it can propose becoming an independent, self-contained C.U. The organizational structure of DAOs, often composed of disparate and independent teams, can create challenges when it comes to defining a consistent organization-wide brand. The primary goal of the Maker Brand team is to ensure that MakerDAO remains a dominant protocol that is \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d when people think of DeFi. The team will focus on four main areas: Brand Research, Content, PR & Comms, and Strategic Initiatives. These activities will help the team execute its five core missions:  Define brand strategy and implementation plan for new strategic partnerships Communicate protocol updates to the public Build brand awareness Own and develop the protocol\u2019s intangible communication assets Build strategic activations with providers  The team will also track four key performance indicators to gauge performance:  Number of announcements Twitter metrics Social media sentiment analysis Dai holders  The full post goes into great detail about the team\u2019s goals and the means of achieving them and how it will be structured.  1600\u00d7516 330 KB   Monthly Governance Review | March, 2022 Governance Communications posted a summary reviewing everything that happened in governance through the month of March. Summary The summary is relatively technical and breaks down all the votes and polls throughout March. Governance-related activity is also available in the Monthly Review if anybody has missed something or would like to catch up on a specific topic. The summary includes financials and budgets, delegation, tokenomic discussions, collaterals and RWAs, Core Unit activity, and what to expect for April 2022.

Summary 6sCP is a financial ratio-driven operating business, which means that oversight regarding the amount of equity in the business is critical. 6sCP decided to include an audit requirement in the Credit Agreement even though MakerDAO did not request it. The 6sCP team believes that \u201ca U.S. GAAP financial statement audit is a milestone and from our lens should be a required component for all RWA DAO participants.\u201d  6s Capital - Growth Pains & Plans - Here we grow! This post outlines how 6s Capital plans to reduce reliance on any potential single point of failure, including project pipelines, investors, and credit sources. Summary Relying on a single lender means taking on more systemic risk than necessary. To combat this problem, 6sCP plans to achieve \u201cclient diversity,\u201d Each party must \u201ccompete\u201d for each other\u2019s business, helping foster a win-win environment. The fundamental determining factors that help LendCOs choose credit providers are:  Scope Scale (e.g., size) Transactional certainty Economic terms  6s Capital intends to expand the scope of its lending activities beyond credit tenant leasing with other investors and credit providers. 6s Capital will also be submitting a MIP that outlines how and where MakerDAO can participate in the near future.     Active Discussions  MakerDAO at FATF\u2019s meeting about AML and crypto Community member @jacek has been asked to speak at the global AML watchdog and standard-setter FATF\u2019s meeting next Tuesday about AML and crypto. This post aims to gather feedback from the Maker community about the message @jacek should convey during his presentation. Summary @jacek provides a succinct summary of the purpose of this meeting and what FATF wants to hear from him: \"FATF\u2019s Virtual Assets Contact Group organizes the meeting as part of periodic consultations with the private sector. They want me to provide thoughts on the revised FATF guidance and DeFi. The guidance spurred heated discussion a few months ago (including here in the forum). It has already led to the E.U.'s crackdown on unhosted wallets, and that is just the beginning. The request I received is to reflect on the guidance and provide insights about what can be improved and what further work the FATF should consider.\" If crypto regulation is a topic you are interested in, share your feedback on the post itself or D.M. @jacek directly.  Proposal: Maker3.0 - The future of crypto lending. (RFC) Recognized Delegate MakerMan submitted an aggressive growth proposal for Maker3.0: \u201cThe future of crypto lending.\u201d Summary First, to clarify the terminology: Maker1.0 refers to SCD and SAI, while Maker2.0 refers to MCD and DAI. This proposal is broken down into three concrete actions, some with several sub-actions and additional considerations.  Start fresh: Utilize all available information to create a new, more competitive, better Maker. Create an MKR3 token with 1T issued, and: a. Fund an AMM LP b. Commit to a tight issuance policy of MKR3 c. Create an MKR3DAI v2 vault on Maker2.0 with low S.F. d. Use MKR3 as a reward token to help supercharge TVL in vaults on Maker2.0 e. Use new DAI earned by Maker2.0 from the increased TVL in the MKR3 rewarded vaults to build MKR3-DAI-owned LP f. Solicit MKR3 sales to V.C.s to raise capital for what will become the Maker2.0 and Maker3.0 secondary loss backstop and/or treasury proper g. Create and fund a unit tasked with managing MKR3 markets, liquidity, price, and reward flow h. Create and fund a unit to begin work on the vision and design for Maker3.0 i. Use MKR3DAI LP to organize token swaps with other communities that support the creation and use of TOKEN-DAI v2 vaults State that MKR3DAI LP will be the backbone of governance in Maker3.0 rather than MKR3  The proposal concludes with a discussion section to prompt feedback and discussion from the community.  Immediate & Short-term Parameter Changes Proposal for CRVV1ETHSTETH-A - DC and gap increase The Risk Core Unit team has put together a proposal for two sets of parameter changes to CRVV1ETHSTETH-A. GovAlpha has tagged this a high-impact proposal. Summary Parameter Change 1: The Immediate DC-IAM line (D.C.) changes from 3M to 5M DAI Due to technical concerns aired by the Risk Core Unit, the team proposed 5M DC in October 2021; this was lowered to 3M in March 2022. These concerns have been addressed, so this proposal would immediately increase D.C. for the remaining 2M to 5M. This proposal will be included in the next executive vote on April 8. Parameter Change 2: The Short-term Parameter Changes Proposal This proposal would result in an additional increase in the debt ceiling and the DC-IAM gap, now advisable because this collateral has passed the initial performance observation period, during which initial D.C. is set lower for observation purposes. This proposal will be included in next week\u2019s on-chain poll on Monday, April 11.  Parameter Changes Proposal - PPG-OMC-001 - 31 March 2022 The MakerDAO Open Market Committee has submitted a proposal for parameter changes to collateral types WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WSTETH-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A, GUNIV2DAIUSDC2-A, and AAVE D3M. GovAlpha has tagged this a high-impact proposal. Summary In the first section, the authors provide context for their proposed parameter changes, outlining parameter changes other protocols have implemented recently to boost their market competitiveness. In summary: Aave: Introducing stETH as collateral resulted in a significant boost in demand for borrowing ETH, increasing ETH deposit rates from close to 0% to about 0.4%. This increase may be further amplified if Aave passes a proposal to update the ETH interest rate model, potentially leading to a deposit rate increase of about 1.9%.  882\u00d7590 29.8 KB  Compound: Compound recently adopted a proposal to reduce COMP liquidity incentives by 50%. To bootstrap liquidity, a proposal to limit incentives to newly added assets is likely to follow in the coming weeks.  1248\u00d7794 189 KB  On to the proposed changes themselves. In summary: WBTC-A Parameter Change: Reduce stability fee to 3.25% Goal: Reverse the recent trend of large outflows of WBTC-A WBTC-B Parameter Change: Reduce stability fee to 4.5% Goal: Help grow usage of this vault type WSTETH-A Parameter Change: Reduce stability fee to 2.25% Goal: Help maintain competitiveness with Aave (which has recently seen a large amount of stETH deposits) and attract new users as the stETH total supply increases CRVV1ETHSTETH-A Parameter Change: Reduce stability fee to 2.25% Goal: Take market share on this collateral type from Abracadabra (the only other lender accepting this asset as collateral) without exposing Maker to excessive risk GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A Parameter Change: Reduce stability fee to 0%, Goal: increase the debt ceiling to 750M and increase the gap to 50M Goal: Significantly reduce exposure to USDC through the PSM, improving Maker\u2019s centralization risk profile at a very low cost GUNIV2DAIUSDC2-A Parameter Change: Reduce stability fee to 0.05% and increase the debt ceiling to 1B Goal: Improve centralization risk profile AAVE D3M Parameter Change: Increase bar to 3.5% Goal: Address concerns regarding Maker\u2019s debt ceiling being fully utilized and competitive borrowing rates being forced down, potentially reducing Maker\u2019s market share; ensure Maker adheres to the voter-approved mandate of making up only 30% of real Dai supplied and 0.5% maximum effective spread between Maker and Aave rates These changes should reduce yearly revenue by about 6 million DAI (~8%), thanks to a roughly 100M reduction in expected debt exposure to the Aave D3M and stability fee reductions on stETH and WBTC collateral types. The proposed changes will be submitted for on-chain voting next week.  Rethinking budgeting for CUs Core Unit budgeting has been a hot topic on the forums in recent weeks. The latest addition to the discussion comes from Recognized Delegate Justin Case, who analyzes the topic into its parts and explores which parts may be most valuable to focus on. Summary @JustinCase begins by identifying the different elements any budget process must balance:  Ease of comparing different budgets to each other Governance overhead of evaluating a growing number of budgets The ability to make meaningful changes to a budget vs. the need to avoid micromanagement and respect C.U. autonomy The need for oversight vs. work demand on reporting and evaluation The risk of providing C.U.s with too many funds that remain unused and unreturned vs. keeping efficient operations and the need for frequent additional budget requests Over- or underutilization of a given core unit given their budget, especially for core units that primarily serve other core units  Next, Case focuses on two areas where improvement can encourage better budget discipline and help ensure resources are spent on more valuable initiatives. Indirect Financing Indirectly financing some Core Units\u2014meaning they will not receive a direct budget but will be funded on an as-needed basis\u2014will help ensure that only the community\u2019s services are funded. Competition Next, Case describes an interesting idea for introducing natural competition to exert downward pressure on budget proposals. By adding redundancy to the organization of Core Units, namely by establishing parallel C.U.s in the same field while also ensuring that neither C.U. can monopolize all the work, C.U.s will compete to provide the best services the DAO at the lowest cost. Like any proposal, this one comes with its advantages and disadvantages. Pros  Greater focus on objectives as they are now set at the protocol level. Increased cost control because Core Units will have to be attractive to win bids for work. Better redundancy because other Core Units can step up and replace others if they cease to function. Less focus on micromanaging Core Units and detailed budget proposals. Increased Core Unit autonomy.  Cons  Increased governance overhead in designing objectives. With individual Core Units reduced in size, they may be less capable of independently moving the protocol forward. Less security for Core Units may lead to detachment from the protocol.  Discussion on this topic is already heating up. Share your input here.  Using Large Cap Coin as Collateral Offchain Recognized Delegate, Doo Nam, submits a discussion on using large-capitalization coins as off-chain collaterals. He also asks the community whether they support this idea and, if so, what should be the minimum requirement of Dai minted for these large-cap coins? Summary On-chain liquidity is an important part of the criteria for collateral to be onboard. However, there are many large capitalization coins with low liquidity on centralized exchanges that show interest in wanting to provide large collateral and mint a large amount of Dai if they were to be onboarded. As RWA has been gaining attention for Maker Protocol, these coins can be seen as low-hanging fruit. There may be the potential for Maker protocol to create a system that holds collateral tokens in custody, such as exchanges or OTC desks. If it is liquidated, they can still sell them on the market to ensure that debt is repaid. Doo Nam sets up this discussion as a primer, seeking community feedback on the idea. He believes that the criteria to onboard any of these coins should meet the following:  Be greater than $2 billion in circulating market capitalization. Be greater than $200 million in daily trading volume (or a better option would be to examine ways of measuring liquidity risk in the case of large sell-offs). Be willing to mint a significant amount of Dai (amount inquired in the poll below).   1742\u00d71052 130 KB   1752\u00d7880 121 KB   Chips to Tires and Collateral @monkey.irish posted a call to action admonishing Maker community members against shifting important issues\u2014an action that only results in new issues\u2014and encouraging solving issues instead. Toward this goal, he is asking the community to vote \u201cNo\u201d on any MIPs that include prioritization or blocking language. Summary The post opens with an analogy to the car industry. Cars require semiconductors. When there is a shortage of these chips, car companies can manufacture fewer cars. But what happens if we solve the chip problem only to run into a shortage of one of the raw materials required for producing tires? We have the same issue in a different place, and we still cannot produce as many new cars as we would like to. Applying this analogy to collateral onboarding at MakerDAO, @monkey.irish points out that moving collateral Prioritization and Assessments into the Implementation phase is unlikely to do much more than shifting the issue somewhere else.  image1380\u00d7710 94.9 KB  The post closes with a statement of what @monkey.irish is asking of the MakerDAO community. He argues that the keys to solving issues instead of shifting them are prioritization and transparency. @monkey.irish is asking the community to help fix the prioritization issue. Describing the current collateral onboarding process and its prioritization phase as broken, he argues that the next round of MIPs is likely to include an expansion of the current approach, which will create further ambiguity and unproductive hours on the forums implementation bottlenecks. To avoid this state of affairs, @monkey.irish asks the community to vote \u201cNo\u201d on MIPs that include language about prioritization or blocking,  as stated above.     Seeking Consensus  \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Advance \u201cMIP4c3SP3: Amend MIP64 to allow more flexibility in scope\u201d to on-chain poll @psychonaut submits a signal request to push MIP4c3-SP3 as an on-chain poll. Vote will run until April 12, 2022. Here are the current voting results:  1745\u00d7590 72.3 KB      Ongoing Initiatives  \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Links reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  The next Decentralized Voter Committee, during which @rune will outline Part 4 (MetaDAOs) of his Endgame Plan, will be held this Thursday on Zoom. SES has released a budget reporting tool to improve transparency at Maker. Recognized Delegate @Juanbug made a post outlining the current state of the MIP proposal timeline and asking the community whether it should be shortened to improve efficiency.    News and Announcements Decentralized voter committees: Wednesday and Thursday 9 pm CEST - getting real edition Weekly Decentralized Voter Committees will now take place weekly at 7 PM UTC. Wednesday, 7 PM UTC This meeting focused on establishing the format of these calls to facilitate MKR holder interaction with the governance process. Topics included:  A plan for updating the current priorities of Core Units, redirecting them via MKR voting toward the list of Focus Objectives @rune has been posting Reducing budgets for some Core Units to rein in spending during the bear market  Thursday, 7 PM UTC During this Committee, @rune will present Part 4 of his Endgame Plan, focused on MetaDAOs. Topics will include:  The Creator, Governor, and Reformer roles The 3 MetaDAO core products:  The MetaDAO Lending Engine (D3M powered) The Decentralized Vault Frontend (stability fee revenue share) The Decentralized Workforce Results Guarantee (overhead budget fee)      Updated Growth Task Force Vote (Lite Post-Mortem) In this post, @prose11 outlines why the Growth Task Force MIP (MIP75c3-SP1) was removed and replaced due to an error made by GovAlpha. In short, due to a misreading of the requirements of MIP75, the proposal was posted as a standard ratification poll instead of in a Ranked Choice IRV format, as defined by MIP75. MIP75 is currently up for approval, and this was the first MIP75 sub-proposal submitted. The new vote will end at the original time: Monday, June 27th at 16:00 UTC. GovAlpha will be updating how they review new MIPs to avoid similar issues in the future.  Introducing a Budget Reporting Tool for Core Units The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES) has developed a custom tool to improve Core Unit budget transparency.  Reduce informational costs Structure data that currently exists in many different formats and locations Offer a broad spectrum of detail, from abstracted insights to granular views   The Core Unit Budget Reporting Tool is intended to make it easy for Core Unit Facilitators to ensure that the API supplies all necessary financial data for fostering openness and transparency in the Maker organization.  A video walkthrough of the new tool is available here. With many of the core tools in working condition, SES\u2019s goal now is to build out a user-friendly UI for the API and dashboard. This will involve:  Finance data collection and availability through the API Finance data availability in the dashboard (at both the CU & DAO levels) Initiative and roadmap data availability in the dashboard (at both the CU & DAO levels) People data availability in the dashboard (at both the CU & DAO levels) Enabling better integration of the five major MakerDAO governance platforms (in collaboration with other core units)  Voting Portal MIPs Portal MakerDAO Discourse Forum Ecosystem Performance Dashboard makerburn.com       Active Discussions [Discussion] Delegate Roles and Incentives @Eumenes of the Real World Finance Core Unit calls for a Specialized Delegate role, in which delegates focus on their areas of expertise instead of being required to take on a \u201cJack of all trades\u201d role.  Increasing MIP Efficiency Community Poll In this post, Recognized Delegate @Juanbug outlines the current state of the MIP proposal timeline and submits a poll asking the community for opinions on adjusting the parameters. The current timeline includes:  4 weeks (RFC) request for comment period ~1-week intermittent time  ~3 days of formal submission ~4 days of waiting time prior to ratification polls   2 weeks ratification poll for formal voting  @Juanbug argues that this seven-week period is too long and inefficient. Activity tends to accelerate close to the formal submission window, with little activity in the first few days of a proposal\u2019s lifecycle. There also appears to be a clear \u201cdead zone\u201d during weeks two and three.  The post closes with a suggestion for a shorter, potentially more efficient timeline:  3 weeks (RFC) request for comment period  4 days intermittent time 3 days of formal submission   1 day of waiting time prior to ratification polls. 1-week ratification poll for formal voting    Celsius will probably be liquidated and the consequences for MakerDao @makercaesar made a post asking the community how MakerDAO might be impacted if Celsius, a major Vault user, is liquidated. @adcv of the Strategic Finance Core Unit dropped in to explain that Maker is not at risk of anything beyond losing business from a longstanding customer:  773\u00d7245 38.6 KB   \u201cRuble gold standard\u201d @cryptenthusiastic published a post making a case for introducing a DaiRUB token pegged to the Russian ruble, which was confirmed in March to have been moved to the gold standard in an attempt to strengthen it in the face of multiple economic crises. @cryptenthusiastic argues that \u201cthe Achilles heel of the Dollar is becoming more visible and vulnerable,\u201d and Maker must be ready to adapt if necessary. Offering a token pegged to a currency on the gold standard may be one way to stay prepared.  MKR almost below $900 @Leritu posted a popular MKR price discussion post, describing the token as \u201cin a death spiral with all the other altcoins.\u201d In a comment, @cryptenthusiastic argues that falling prices result from a combination of the current macroeconomic outlook and a natural correction in the market, stating that \u201cnothing unusual or alarming\u201d is going on. @adcv adds that the MKR price has long been strongly correlated to the price of WETH:   Change on-chain voting from voting by raise of hands to voting by ballot  This informal poll submitted by @Balloonist asks why Maker on-chain voting is fully transparent\u2014i.e., why do we vote by show of hands rather than by ballot? Pros: Show of hands  May be easier to document that decision-making in MakerDAO is decentralized Transparency around delegates\u2019 votes is useful for documenting that opinions and actions are aligned Great for further discussion in small groups with a high level of mutual trust  Pros: Ballot  Voters are protected against intimidation, etc. after voting takes place Reduces the risk of corruption (because it is more difficult to buy votes) Possible to document who voted without revealing their choices Voters can bring arguments for or against proposals regardless of how they voted  Commenters point out technical feasibility and industry standards as points in favor of show-of-hand voting.   Independent review of ALM Framework for MakerDAO and Suggestions For Balance Sheet Optimization @One_Pastrami published an independent review of the ALM framework for MakerDAO, together with recommendations for optimizing Maker\u2019s balance sheet. Ideas include:  MakerDAO\u2019s ALM practice is constrained by maintaining DAI\u2019s USD peg and has achieved high liquidity ratios, which provide protocol security but could indicate less than optimal use of funds. Shifting focus to balance sheet optimization to increase net interest income and liquidity buffer and reinvesting in the platform. Recognition of backing collateral for Vaults (i.e., crypto collateral) as liabilities, similar to deposits at banks, and un-invested assets held in reserves, thereby establishing a baseline for balance sheet optimization. Focus on balance sheet optimization by converting crypto reserves to generate additional yield by launching an ALM investment program and/or new product features. Source investment opportunities to generate yield for the PSM vault. Establishing an investment program may lead to a 180 million DAI increase in net interest income. Leverage some of these identified investments to increase the robustness of MakerDAO\u2019s liquidity buffer.    Discussion: External Work Core Unit Facilitator of the Risk Core Unit @Primoz made a post discussing external opportunities for funding projects\u2014in this case, a dashboard similar to the Block Analitica dashboard for Maker\u2014via external sources. Before proceeding, the Risk Core Unit wants to gauge how the community would feel about this undertaking. @Primoz points out that there are already cases in the current Core Unit structure where certain companies have an outside business, but there does not appear to have been any formal discussion regarding this state of affairs. @Primoz is quick to note that any activity outside Maker should ideally have tangible benefits for Maker. In the case of the Aave dashboard under discussion, the analytics derived should be useful for D3M risk monitoring.  Education Partnership Proposal with Mass Effect @ManuelMaccou is building a \u201cknowledge exchange protocol\u201d called Mass Effect that connects learners to subject matter experts. He submitted a post to the Maker forums calling for subject matter experts to get involved with the project. In short: \u201cMass Effect incentivizes a cyclical pattern of learning \u2192 teaching \u2192 learning, allowing for the exponential growth of knowledge transference.\u201d Community members can anonymously nominate others here.  [Informal Poll] Permit the RWF Core Unit to allocate time and resources to reviewing an upcoming New Silver request for Debt Ceiling increase  @prankstr25 of New Silver submitted an informal poll asking the community to allow the RWF Core Unit to spend time and resources engaging with New Silver, after which a Signal Request for raising the debt ceiling for New Silver\u2019s Vault to 100-150M DAI will be submitted. Specifically, New Silver and the RWF Core Unit would engage in:  Implementing the Trust Indenture legal structure as outlined in this post  A due diligence review Any other items as needed   Informal Poll: Fix stETH price at 1 ETH and save crypto @g_dip posted an informal poll asking, \u201cShould Maker fix the price of stETH to 1 ETH to help crypto traders avoid liquidation?\u201d So far, most voters are not supportive of the idea:  704\u00d7278 10 KB   [Very Informal Poll] MKR Cash Out @Spidomo asks: \u201cPurely as a hypothetical, would it be nice if the protocol would cash out any MKR holder their proportional share of the Surplus Buffer (currently around 91 Dai) in exchange for each MKR token upon request?\u201d The post has generated a handful of comments, from lukewarm acceptance to rejection.  The Endgame Plan part 3: The Endgame Decentralized Workforce @rune published Part 3 of his Endgame Plan for revamping Maker governance.  Check out our summary of this post in Monday\u2019s Weekly Relay.  Specialization Unlocks Complexity In this post, @Teej argues why Maker governance should be split into two primary groups, Governors and Clusters, to help tame Maker\u2019s governance complexity.  Read our summary of this post in the Weekly Relay for more information.   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Set the AAVE D3M DC to 0 (Zero)  Poll Closes on June 20th, 2022, at 17:00 UTC  The current market environment is too volatile, separating the more robust lending protocols everywhere, centralized or not, from those with lower risk standards. Unfortunately, AAVE is currently loaded with risk with large exposure to stETH. AAVE also has a large surface area due to cross-collateralization (unlike Maker), where other borrowers can take out the locked collateral like ETH and WBTC in the protocol. It also operates on multiple chains, which means that it carries exposure to centralized bridge failure risk on all those chains. It\u2019s a risky environment, in general, to extend a 100M Debt Ceiling when the dominant theme is redemption. The AAVE-DAI pool currently has enough reserves right now for MakerDAO to withdraw. If the DAI reserves become empty, any periodic DAI repayments from other borrowers will be snatched quickly by bots, and a protocol like MakerDAO will be locked in for a long time. Similar to how Central Banks increase or decrease Money Supply, the D3M was initially meant to supply liquidity on a short-term basis, and MakerDAO can risk locking its liquidity up for a long time. It\u2019s a small percentage of the total MakerDAO TVL, but the amount is large enough to cause issues to the surplus buffer. Pros:  Risk Profile is now higher (100M at Risk), and these new factors should be discussed. The Stability Fee rate in Maker and AAVE are already at parity which means we do not need this D3M to operate right now, so it can be turned off without causing any issues. MKR token owners, community members, and Delegates should gather data and analysis from folks monitoring various data points on this thread so that MakerDAO can make an informed choice.  Cons:  Decrease in DAI deposits via the AAVE D3M Decrease in D3M will hamper 1,000,000++ DAI income to Maker   1705\u00d7907 175 KB   URGENT: Signal Request Set Aave D3M bar to 0%  Poll Closes on June 15th, 2022, at 20:00 UTC  GovAlpha has submitted an urgent Signal Request in response to this post by @Primoz. Maker Governance is asked if the Aave D3M bar should be set to 0. As an added check, setting the bar to 0 makes the target supply 0. You can set the bar to 0 using a MOM; this bypasses the GSM Pause Delay and allows any changes to take effect when the Executive Vote is executed. As Signal Request will be for 24 hours and, if successful, will be followed by an expedited Executive Vote containing only this proposal. Pros:  Protects the Surplus Buffer and Maker holders by reducing the risk posed by the Aave D3M.  Cons:  Turns off the Aave D3M leading to reduced revenue for Maker  The Signal Request will run until June 15th at 20:00 UTC. In the event of a majority of non-abstaining voters, an expedited Executive Vote will be initiated as soon as possible (likely Wednesday, June 15th). This is outside the usual Executive Voting cycle as in MIP24 and MIP41. If this Urgent Signal Request has a positive outcome, it overrides the ongoing Signal Request by @flipflopflapdelegate, which will be canceled. Further information on the Aave D3M and the bar parameter can be found here.  1702\u00d7802 150 KB    Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Click here for a list of current initiatives: Maker Operational Manual - GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Maker DeFi DAO Governance Report: A review of major DeFi DAO governance systems in the Ethereum ecosystem GovAlpha has produced a comprehensive 61-page DAO Governance Report to provide a deep analysis of governance structures among Ethereum DAOs and develop an understanding of how to apply this research to improving Maker governance. The themes of broad participation, resistance to capture, resistance to attack, openness, and incentive alignment are present throughout the report. The authors examine the ways different organizations work to achieve these goals and discuss the implications for MakerDAO. The report focuses on eight of the most prominent Ethereum DAOs:  Uniswap Compound Curve Synthetix Aave SushiSwap Index Coop DXdao  Trade Receivables Market Recap On the heels of high volatility in both the equity and crypto markets brought on by US Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Real World Finance Core Unit published an overview of the current situation regarding trade finance as an asset class. Characteristics of Receivables  Low correlation with traditional markets because they are short term and self-liquidating Underlying commercial trading activity supports the ultimate repayment of receivables to continue operations\u2014higher recoveries vs. other unsecured obligations  Challenges Global supply chain disruption continues to cause problems for firms involved in international trade, which will have an impact on the availability of working capital. Reuters reports that \u201cshipping something from a warehouse in China to one in the United States currently takes 74 days longer than usual,\u201d which is leading some companies to analyze their counterparty relationships to address resultant cashflow shortcomings. Small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) are at a disadvantage due to lacking the resources to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers for dealing with cashflow issues. Opportunities Due to size, granularity, operational inefficiency concerns, and regulatory issues, banks tend to avoid working with SMEs when there are other options available. This is where MakerDAO can step in to finance SMEs that have consistently demonstrated their value as a well-run business through metrics such as:  Solid margins (pricing power) Positive cashflow generation (for repayment) Prudent management of the balance sheet (reinvestment of profits in the business, adequate and manageable debt levels)   Decentralized Voter Committee Citing the decentralization risk inherent in any large system such as a DAO that falls prey to a \"complexity spiral\"\u2014in which it becomes increasingly difficult for anyone but a full-time professional DAO member to develop and maintain a complete understanding of the inner workings of the DAO and how decisions are made\u2014MakerDAO co-founder @rune has shared his Endgame Plan strategy, which aims to:  Establish principles that enshrine radical decentralization and transparency as fundamental pillars for how governance works Create a bounded, immutable scope of Maker Governance it cannot expand beyond to prevent organic complexity growth  The first step of the Endgame Plan is to establish Decentralized Voter Committees, in which MKR holders are provided a \u201csafe space\u201d to air their concerns, discuss their interests, and coordinate on votes. These committees will take the form of transparent, recorded conference calls available both to members of the DAO and to the general public. The first Decentralized Voter Committee took place on Tuesday, May 17th, at 5 pm CEST (3 pm UTC). The first Decentralized Voter Committee was designed to serve as \u201ca bit of a test run\u201d and will likely focus on bringing in larger MKR holders, who \u201chave more skin in the game and a larger sway on votes.\u201d A thread for discussing potential topics and ideas for the first meeting is available here.  iammeeoh has taken the liberty of summarizing the DAO Singularity meetings organized by Rune throughout the last month.     \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Request Return of MKR Tokens Inadvertently Sent to Governance Address wingstick_99942 inadvertently sent 3.1994 MKR to the MKR Governance Address and submitted a signal request in hopes of a way to return that MKR to the sender\u2019s address. Several Core Unit members and Recognized Delegates stated the unfortunate reality that it is impossible to return MKR from the Governance Address because nobody has keys or control over that address. The vote will run until May 30th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1690\u00d7730 103 KB   Offboard UNI, UNIV2DAIETH, UNIV2WBTCETH, UNIV2UNIETH, and UNIV2WBTCDAI This signal request was prepared by the CMON (Collateral Management On-chain) initiative and its stakeholders, including different CES-led core units. Due to lack, they propose to offboard UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A of demand and consequent negative cash flow. The main problem with these vault types is pure lack of demand as the underlying assets (ETH, WBTC, and UNI) have relatively high on-chain liquidity. MOMC attempted to make them more attractive by lowering the SF at the end of January, but demand, unfortunately, didn\u2019t increase. Proposed parameters were set in a way where we try to minimize the damage done to existing vault owners while ensuring that sufficient amounts of debt will either be repaid or, less desirable, liquidated with minimal costs for the vault owners. Proposed parameter changes;  Set liquidation penalty to 0% Set debt ceiling to 0 Set tip to 0 Set duration of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio to 30 days Set the end parameter of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio for each vault type as the following; highest collateral ratio vault within each vault type multiplied by 3, rounded on hundred.  The vote will run until May 26th, 2022 Outcomes will either result in on-chain polls assuming the outcomes are yes, or will be reinitiated with different parameters and/or strategies.

Teleport will burn Dai on the origin chain and mint it on the destination chain without any need for a centralized party.  With these features in place, Maker Teleport is expected to be faster and more secure than an existing competitor; even with a one basis point fee, Teleport is estimated to remain 75-99% cheaper than competing protocols. While one basis point may seem low, the Strategic Finance Core Unit believes that Teleport will experience strong growth, leading to significant revenues for Maker.

BaconCoin is a stablecoin backed by US mortgages. Potential benefits include:  A single onboarding procedure that can scale both the amount of capital used and the number of home loans over time Broad distribution of Dai to homeowners in the US Higher risk-adjusted yields across a diversified set of home loans Maker selects the underwriting criteria to use, allowing for investing in loans that are highly aligned with Maker\u2019s vision of funding sustainability initiatives Bacon will develop and maintain the D3M integration in line with the CES enablement strategy Governance has direct control over the Dai supply added to Bacon through the Debt Ceiling  @abdalla lists smart contract risk as a potential con but also offers two ideas for mitigating risks:  Whitelisting addresses with deposit functionality can reduce exploit risk (Maker would be the only liquidity provider) Credit risk assessment of borrowers can be performed by loan originators using the industry-standard FICO score  Voting has recently ENDED Here are the current voting results:  1692\u00d7737 124 KB   Increase the ESM Minimum Threshold GovAlpha submitted a Signal Request to gauge support for increasing the minimum threshold to trigger the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) from 100,000 MKR to 150,000 MKR. GovAlpha recommends this adjustment to minimize the threat of a hostile emergency shutdown occurring. With the recent fall in the MKR price, triggering an emergency shutdown has become significantly cheaper based on the current minimum threshold. The goal is to find the right balance between making it very expensive for a bad actor to acquire or borrow enough MKR to trigger an emergency shutdown without making it overly difficult for a legitimate emergency shutdown to be triggered if necessary (for example, in response to the discovery of a critical bug in the Maker Protocol or the prevention of a malicious governance attack). The vote will run until May 20th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1675\u00d7760 126 KB   Antalpha Institutional Vault @William_Chiu has compiled recent discussions between the Growth, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Unites and Antalpha to propose a new institutional vault. The post outlines both the goals of the proposal and the mechanisms for achieving them. Goals  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability  Mechanisms  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability-   Origination fee: will be applied to all DAI at the time of minting. This is not restricted and is open to change via Governance (specifically the Parameter Changes Proposal group). Meaning that any partner will have a lead time of 2-3 weeks before any changes are implemented. Stability fee: is determined upfront and fixed for a period of time. This fixed rate can be reduced as additional collateral is added. Vault starting size: to ensure that such vaults will mint a minimum amount of DAI to gain favorable rates. Antalpha intends to utilize a DAI loan to strengthen the stable coin portion of the balance sheet to support one of its primary lending and borrowing businesses. Antalpha will take on collateral at a higher level than the level borrowing from DAI to implement proper credit risk management and utilize systems and algorithmic trading to facilitate managing the loans and collateral.  Proposed Terms     Institutional Vault Type Permissioned ETH and wBTC Vaults (INST-WBTC-5, INST-ETH-5)     Qualifying Vault size: 200MM   Debt Ceiling 1B, 500MM for ETH, and 500MM for wBTC   Origination fee: 1% of DAI minted   Origination fee behavior: Origination fee is not restricted and can be changed through Governance via a Parameter Changes Proposal. Antalpha has a 2-3 week lead-time to any Origination fee rate change.   Origination fee future commitments Maker and Antalpha will work together to propose reductions to the origination fee if the vault size grows significantly.   Stability fee: WBTC-A stability fee1 - 50bps & ETH-A stability fee2 - 50bps   Stability fee3 behavior: Fixed for six months. After the 200m DAI minted, an additional 100m DAI minted will reduce the stability fee by ten basis points (per vault) to a minimum of Stability fee-30bps for six months. The stability fee reduction will be manual via an executive vote. After six months, open community dialogue facilitated by the Growth CU will determine ongoing stability fees.   Collateral Ratio: 150%   Collateral Ratio Behavior: Failure to maintain 200% CR4 over the majority of seven days will increase the SF to 5% and the LR to 150%. The seven days would be calculated by ensuring that 95% of the OSM updates show that the CR is equal to or greater than 200%.   Liquidation Ratio: 120%     Here are the current voting results:  1685\u00d7675 122 KB   Voting has recently ENDED  Deploy the balance sheet in ETH As expressed in Towards taking asset risk and A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy, ETH seems like a sound investment for MakerDAO. Sebastian from Strategic Finance moves forward on the Balance Sheet Approach toward an Aggressive Growth Strategy by gauging community sentiment on whether we would like to begin working on allocating some of the MakerDAO balance sheets into ETH and/or ETH derivatives. He presents the pros and cons of potentially implementing this investment into ETH: Pros:  MakerDAO is using Ethereum as its home base and is therefore linked to the success of ETH. ETH is a strategic asset for the operations of the DAO because it pays gas fees for on-chain transactions and oracles. Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO, and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet, and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage. The upcoming Merge will significantly reduce the issuance of new ETH and create a competitive market for balance sheets with a high degree of exposure to ETH. Post-Merge staking fees are currently estimated at 7-11%, doubling current staking yields overnight and making ETH a truly productive asset.  Cons:  ETH is a volatile asset whose ETH/DAI price can wildly fluctuate and occasionally go down over significant periods The Merge and L2 impacts can have unexpected long-term impacts on price.  Sebastian also notes that this Signal Request aims to understand whether there is a community desire to work on this topic. No priority is currently being attributed, and a formal implementation for such actions will have to go through the governance processes.

News and Announcements Off-Chain MIPs Collateral Update: What\u2019s Going On Over the past few months, the Real-World Finance (RWF) Core Unit has been working closely with entities interested in partnering with Maker to onboard off-chain collateral. The teams reviewing proposals for new collateral are working hard to follow the process outlined in MIP67. Given the number of proposals, however, these teams need a way to prioritize them. Prioritization will depend on several different factors, including:  Current status along the collateral onboarding process Potential financial impact of the protocol Perceived financial and execution risk Level of completion and available details Perceived quality of the counterparty Perceived strategic value in the transaction  The remainder of the post is dedicated to providing an overview of what the RWF Core Unit is working on. In order of priority: 1. MIP6: SocGen  Ongoing; working through technical and legal mechanics in the agreements See also here   2. MIP65: Project Clydesdale  High-level opinion already provided by LOVE; nothing to do ahead of voting  3. MIP68: Monetalis V2  Independent risk assessments already provided by RWF (here) and LOVE (here); nothing to do at this stage  4.

No funds have been lost, and no funds are at risk. A fix has already been deployed, and the Protocol Engineering Core Unit (PE) plans to include updating the vest to point to the new contract in the next Executive Vote on April 15th. Because this system is entirely external to the Maker core system, PE can move much faster than normal. The authors point out that the downside of this is the potential for bugs like this one\u2014small, with minimal risk of loss of funds\u2014to arise. The post concludes positively: Tech-Ops, Keep3r Network, and Gelato are now fully live and redundantly supporting non-critical keeper functionality.     Active Discussions Minimality - KISS principle In this post, @iammeeoh shares their thoughts on minimality or minimalism and how it can help us move forward. The author views Maker\u2019s historical approach to collateral onboarding as following a \u201cminimal \u2192 larger \u2192 BIG/BLOAT \u2192 back to minimal\u201d trajectory. Drawing on a recent interview with @NikKunkel, in which he was asked, \u201cWhat kind of collateral do you think Maker will have in the future?\u201d (answer: BTC + ETH + RWAs), @iammeeoh summarizes the path we\u2019ve followed so far:   MakerDAO started extremely simple with single collateral Dai backed only by ETH.   Next, a huge technological advancement happened with multi-collateral DAI. At launch in 2019, MakerDAO included the BAT token and a couple of others.   Over the ensuing months, MakerDAO experimented with many other tokens. This phase is extremely important. It provided case studies, experiences, new challenges, solutions, etc.   Ultimately, the DAO realized that it\u2019s pointless to have 2,000 altcoins with a low market cap (like BAT mentioned above) given the high costs (risks, oracles, etc.).   It looks like (following @NikKunkel\u2019s vision) we are going back to a minimalistic setup.   @iammeeoh argues that this path has been very productive: \u201cWe have dynamically explored the space, matured educated opinions, and ultimately settled for the best tradeoff. Also, some things like the PSM staked ETH, etc. are a result of this \u2018research.\u2019\u201d @iammeeoh believes we are on a similar path concerning real-world assets (RWA) and that it is time to take a step back and evaluate our efforts in this direction so far. Unsurprisingly, \u201csome have produced some results, some are just starting, some others are dead branches.\u201d The author believes a good approach is to downsize our efforts and focus heavily on one or two promising areas, particularly technical ones, such as L2s, integrations with other protocols, Oracle expansion, and security.  A Letter to the CUs on Community Impatience and Trust Inspired by another post, @Traster_Tray posted a thoughtful, open letter to MakerDAO Core Units aiming to provide some perspective on the impatience some community members have noticed concerning some proposals and the process of onboarding Real World Assets (RWA). 1. Shifting Directions Maker began as a way to create a very efficient lending system using crypto-native assets as collateral; token holders would share in the profits via the buyback and burn model. With the introduction of the surplus buffer, its evolution from a risk-reduction measure to a tool for supporting growth, and a generally increased focus on growth over profit-sharing, those who weren\u2019t onboard with these changes may feel frustrated. 2. Unsustainable Rise in Operating Expenses While representing a big opportunity for growth, RWA also brings with it a large increase in operating costs. The decrease in funds available in the surplus buffer every month, together with the lack of a cap on expenses and no timeline for the realization of revenue growth, may lead some to want to onboard every RWA available in hopes of getting the ball rolling as soon as possible. 3. Growing Perception of Greed and Waste As operating expenses grow and individual CUs spend more funds, some may wonder if funds are being used efficiently. As the author puts it, \u201cI do believe there\u2019s plenty of work being done, and teams feel they still need more help but is it being done efficiently? Is the right work being done? Or does more manpower result in more conflicts and arguments over who\u2019s right and what we should be doing?\u201d 4. Centralized Voting Power Another issue @Traster_Tray would like to see addressed the concentration of voting power. 5. CU Influence and Power Some community members may feel a certain imbalance of power between Core Units and individual community members, especially when there are no concrete deadlines. In short, while they believe in Maker and the abilities of its contributors, the author wants to clarify our processes and improve efficiency: \u201cI simply want the CUs to understand why patience is hard and hope this promotes efforts for more transparency, clarity, and accountability, ultimately to bring more trust between alienated MKR holders and CUs.\u201d  Tesla Taps MakerDAO-Powered Lender for $7.8M Real Estate Deal A recent Defiant article reports that 6s Capital, a commercial lender powered by MakerDAO, finalized a real estate deal worth $7.8M for Tesla. A forum member even got a direct quote: \u201cMakerDAO forum-goer @aburban90 responded to the news, commenting, \u2018we\u2026 closed our first deal with Tesla yesterday? Smells bullish.\u201d It\u2019s always exciting to see Maker mentioned in the headline of a major crypto publication, but several forum commenters have pointed out initial inaccuracies in the article and the lack of any attempt to contact a MakerDAO representative for comment. It may be worth considering opening a role for a dedicated Maker media liaison or press office. [Discussion] Establishing Minimum Interest Rates Guidelines for MIP borrowers @CodeKnight opens the floor for discussion on setting guidelines for a minimum acceptable rate for borrowers in this post. Any applicant below these guidelines will need to make a strong case for approval. This post has attracted significant discussion; throw in your two cents if this is a topic you\u2019re interested in. Boosting Dai usage by funding an L2 In this post, @monteluna considers options for growing Dai usage by building out our own Layer 2 platform, arguing that \"a native chain with applications and savings is a clear demand driver that actualizes growth,\" as has been the case for Luna and UST. Some options include:  MakerDAO could directly partner or merge with Gnosis and probably significantly discount or pay for transaction fees for some time. Direct ownership of an L2 with free transactions could significantly drive growth. This is optimal as Dai is the base layer transaction token. MakerDAO could partner with StarkWare and create a brand new StarkNet L2 where fees are free, and the base layer transaction token is Dai. This seems interesting from a growth perspective but doesn\u2019t tap into the EVM for growth. MakerDAO could partner with ZK-Sync and possibly run a forked ZK-Rollup for transactions only. Their old alpha version of ZK-Rollups without smart contract features could boost DAI usage easily. A small roadmap for this would be refactoring the Dai Wallet 1 to link to this ZK-Rollup, translating the app into various targeted languages like Korean, Spanish, Chinese, etc., and marketing it as a small payment wallet. The general cost of the rollup itself could be quite cheap, and MakerDAO could likely fund all of its use. This seems like the cheapest and easiest option at the moment.   Charting a Path For RWAs - The Case For Continuity Authors: @teej, @Eumenes, and @SebVentures Several authors contributed to posting a lengthy but very detailed and candid contextualization of MakerDAO's evolution concerning Real World Assets, beginning with the early MakerDAO 1.0, which was focused on crypto loans, and moving on to filling in everything that happened between then and now, such as the economic realities of RWAs, the opportunities they present, stability risks and solutions, and continued decentralization. The case focuses on continuity, such as pushing the \u201cAggressive Growth Strategy\u201d and raising our Surplus Buffer. We also need a code of principles to help us stay on the most promising path forward. RWAs have the potential to strengthen both the protocol and public belief in the peg\u2013we should take advantage of that. @Traster_Tray has already responded with another thread, A Letter to the CUs on Community Impatience and Trust. The author presents their perspective on some of the current issues around RWAs, specifically among the community. This post discusses shifting directions, the unsustainable rise in operational expenses, a growing perception of greed and waste, centralized voting power, and Core Unit influence and power.  Clarification on PECU Initiatives & Priorities @Derek made a post to clarify the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's current initiatives, goals, and progess in response to some comments on the Maker Discord's #Speculation channel. PECU Current Engineering Tasks The following engineering work summarizes existing technical development:  Compound D3M DssGate PAXG TUSD Offboarding DssCure (for L2) DssProxy (for L2 and core protocol) Core protocol initiatives  DssDeployScripts maintenance & enhancements Keeper maintenance & enhancements Chainlog migration & enhancements Associated safety, review, and internal audit work    PECU Pre-MIP Advisory Work  The team is advising Maple Finance to ensure that their future integration with Maker will be possible and safe. Similarly, we have met in person with TrueFi at EthDenver to ensure future alignment if/when Governance determines we proceed. Initial investigation has been done into Rari pools to ensure that the solution we build is scalable for future implementations. Initial meeting with OasisProMarkets (re: India Power Green Bonds and others) to ensure future token integration will be possible (wrt how ES, liquidations, and other components will function). Informational meetings with L2 ecosystems not yet in the formal roadmap to ensure canonical DAI can be implemented across domains.   MIP6 Recommended Guideline Metrics for Onchain Collateral Onboarding Continuing the ongoing discussion regarding the most effective process for onboarding new assets into Maker, this collaboration between the CES, Risk, Growth, PE, and Oracle Core Units offers a set of guidelines for assessing candidate collateral. Because every asset has its unique collection of attributes and market conditions are always in flux, no assessment framework can provide hard-and-fast \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d answers every time; the goal is to provide a toolbox to help MakerDAO make more well-informed and educated decisions. For additional context, check out the latest Governance and Risk Call discussing collateral onboarding and management. Recommendations: 30M Dai minimum target debt ceiling: The Core Units involved in the collateral onboarding process have agreed that candidate collateral should be expected to generate at least 30M Dai. Reasons include collateral onboarding and maintenance costs, the upfront work required, ongoing operational/maintenance work, bandwidth costs, and opportunity costs. Clear business case: The technical ability to support a 30M+ debt ceiling doesn\u2019t mean much without an audience of users willing and able to generate more Dai. For this reason, it is crucial to investigate how much actual usage a new type of collateral may stimulate. Min. $250M market cap of circulating supply: Requiring this minimum will help ensure that Maker does not become overexposed to any newly onboarded assets. If we assume a max 30% of circulating supply as a guideline for crypto token collateral and average debt weighted CR in the vault type at 250%, the asset needs a minimum circulating market cap of $250M for a minimum DC of $30m (Min DC*CR/MaxRatioOfSupply = 30M*2.5/0.30 = 250M).  Min. $40M of onchain liquidity (132% of debt ceiling): Like the minimum circulating supply, this minimum is derived from the debt ceiling figure. By considering the CR distribution of positions in the ETH-A vault and an expected drawdown or jump risk of 40%, it is expected that approximately 26.5% of total Dai debt will be liquidated. After this 40% drop, vaults CR will go below LR.  Based on the previous minimum debt ceiling, an estimation can be made for how much Dai debt would be liquidated in such a scenario.  If the liquidation penalty is 13%, the system can slip up to approximately 27% price slippage before depleting the buffer created by the penalty and potentially creating bad debt. Therefore, the maximum allowed price slippage after a 40% drop is 27%. By utilizing this number (27%) in the AMM x*y=k formula, we can derive that such slippage occurs when around 35-40% of assets are sold compared to the pool size of the asset. This means that assets should have five times more on-chain liquidity compared to liquidated debt (in the case of an equally weighted two-asset AMM).  945\u00d7386 59.1 KB  Traded on at least five exchanges with: 1. Daily exchange volume of the collateral asset >$2M., and 2Order book depth of over $200k in the +2% and -2% tiers: The presence of these metrics will help ensure that the price sources needed to build and maintain an oracle for the new asset are difficult to manipulate. Technical metrics to gauge complexity and upfront implementation cost: The more of these metrics a candidate collateral type checks off, the easier the onboarding should be in terms of technical difficulty:  Implements ERC20 token standard Can utilize existing ExchangeCallee contracts for flash liquidations; the currently supported exchanges are Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, and Curve; must have sufficient liquidity on these exchanges to support liquidations Audit(s) from a reputable firm(s), e.g., Trail of Bits, ChainSecurity, ABDK No admin functions/upgradability No rebasing/changing supply of individual token balances No blacklists/whitelists Transfer semantics should be simple; e.g., no fees on transfers  For more discussion on collateral onboarding, this time focusing on real-world assets, scroll down to the Forum Insight below.

Online PDF version Medium publishing soon! | GovComms Medium Account   \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  The stablecoin liquidity buffer lost more than 1B Dai over the past month. Where did it go? An ALM Liquidity Update analyzes what happened.  @christiancdpetersen posted Why Integrating DeFi and Real World Finance is Hard, the first in a series of posts exploring the challenge of integrating real world finance with DeFi. An informal poll is underway to gauge interest in developing a new Core Unit focused on professional media production.    ALM Liquidity Update In the last month, the stablecoin liquidity buffer lost more than 1B Dai, primarily due to the unwinding of some yield farming. This may have been due to a migration of some users to Stargate, which does not currently have a Dai pool. The stablecoin liquidity buffer reached a new all-time high on March 18th, with 6.2B Dai in stablecoins. The buffer now holds only 5.1B Dai, for a loss of 1.1B Dai within a single month. But where exactly did all that Dai go?  1600\u00d7875 35.7 KB    Avalanche: There is currently 768M DAI on the Avalanche Bridge, which was 284M less than one month ago. The biggest user of Dai seems to be Aave, incentivized with the AVAX token.  Compound significantly reduced liquidity mining rewards on March 19th.  Fantom: There was a spike of Dai on Fantom for yield farming, but it decreased linearly.  DEX/3pool: Many Dai is sitting in Curve\u2019s 3pool. This pool is not a great opportunity but is pushed by metapools on it. It is mainly the FRAX, UST, and MIM metapools that are the reason for the TVL of 3pool.  ETH loans: There was increased demand for ETH loans, which reduces the stablecoin liquidity buffer if that Dai is not held. Most of this demand comes via Nexo. The rest remained quite stable.  The post concludes that yield farming users are not \u201csticky,\u201d and it may be a good idea to attempt to label Dai usage related to yield farming and consider it a liquidity risk. Additionally, the PE team is working with Stargate to integrate into D3M and Multichain strategies.   Series: Why Integrating DeFi and Real World Finance is Hard @christiancdpetersen of the Real World Finance Core Unit posted the first in a series on the difficulties and challenges of integrating real world finance with DeFi. First off, the stability fee compounds on a per-second basis, but the borrower calculates the outstanding stability fee, and the time they repay the vault can differ by seconds, minutes, or hours. This mismatch causes a small amount of Dai to remain outstanding, which is a flaw in the design of MIP21 and requires improvement for future deals. In typical real world financing, interest compounds on longer time intervals (usually annually), and debts are paid PIF. What is a Trust Indenture? What is an Indenture Trustee? This post aims to clarify one particular aspect of the legal structure for Centrifuge real world asset (RWA) vaults: the trust indenture and the indenture trustee. A trust indenture is a contract used in a bond offering between the bond issuer and a trustee detailing the terms and conditions the trustee must adhere to and the rights of the trust beneficiaries (e.g., bondholders and tokenholders). A trust indenture also contains terms and conditions about the circumstances that may lead to a default and the process for handling this situation. The indenture trustee is a third-party intermediary that manages the relationship between an issuer and holders of the issuer\u2019s securities (or tokens). The indenture trustee takes care of administrative matters relating to the securities, such as payment processing, and makes sure the issuer complies with the terms of the trust indenture. The actions an indenture trustee might take in a typical default situation include:  Polling the tokenholders and obtaining a decision about whether there should be a restructuring or temporary forbearance Solicit direction from tokenholders on a selection of counsel and/or a financial advisor At the direction of the tokenholders, coordinate between counsel, the issuer, and the financial advisor for the liquidation of the collateral Distribute the proceeds of the liquidation to the tokenholders   INFORMAL POLL: Should MakerDAO RWA establish a free speech trust (Delaware) for the benefit of Web3 and Twitter Users to Finance Elon Musk\u2019s Purchase of and Open Sourcing of Twitter? After acquiring a large stake and becoming Twitter's biggest shareholder, Elon Musk has submitted an offer to take the company private with the stated goal of open sourcing Twitter to safeguard free speech. @maxglass points out the \u201ciconic\u201d status of the social media platform and its role as the town square of crypto and briefly makes a case for why they believe Musk has the capability of pulling off his stated goals and why he might be amenable to a proposal of this nature:  Twitter is inundated with spam and bots It is struggling with how to safeguard freedom of speech The assets of the company are woefully underexploited and mismanaged Twitter could be used to onboard millions of users to Web3 via the adoption of a governance token with on-chain governance and by integrating crypto wallets for user authentication Musk has the resources to acquire Twitter and is demonstrably a champion of free speech Musk has a track record of building best-in-class products and growing his companies exponentially Musk has a track record of actually open sourcing valuable IP such as Tesla patents Musk asserts that \u201cI don\u2019t care about the economics at all,\u201d implying that he would be amenable to the capped upside for him, with excess value accruing to the users of Twitter  The basic structure of the financing would involve the creation of a new vault with a $500M debt ceiling and a MIP21 secure conduit to a Delaware statutory trust. So far, the proposal has received a mixed reception in the comments. INFORMAL POLL: Fund a professional media production company as a core unit that will produce content for the benefit of MakerDAO (e.g., content-marketing to grow Dai supply and expand MakerDAO\u2019s fanbase)? An informal poll is underway to gauge interest in funding a professional media production company as a new Core Unit to boost MakerDAO's content marketing plans. A well-known television production company named Glass Entertainment Group proposes establishing a new production company, the content production core unit \u201cLet\u2019sMakerDAO,\u201d with Nancy Glass as the Core Unit Facilitator. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMXHx027er4 Glass Entertainment Group has over 200 full-time staff across a handful of companies that support all GEG businesses. With the help and education of @maxglass, GEG submitted a post introducing a new Content Production Core Unit called \u201cLet\u2019sMakerDAO,\u201d or LMKR for short. Nancy Glass is the facilitator proposed and the founder of GEG. GEG speaks shortly on their mandate to increase Maker and Dai mass consumption, expand our reachable audience, grow the community, and help promote the MakerDAO name. They will also work with other Core Units to support needs and objectives containing professional audio and video. There are two stages of commercial content production; The development stage delivers a production plan based on a given production budget. The production plan will include a creative description and concept overview, an episodic breakdown, a description of the tone, and a style guide (the \u201clook\u201d of the content. E.g., Fonts & colors). Additionally, an audio-visual proof of concept, typically 90 seconds to 2 minutes, may be applied before voting for production. The production stage is broken down into pre-production, production, and post-production, which can take 12 months. For GEG to enter a production stage, the community would have to vote on GEG\u2019s production budget and plan after they complete the developmental stage. These two stages may likely have their signal requests. Instead of shelling out a large chunk of Dai, GEG applies for three months of development funding at 124.000 Dai. This will include a content marketing strategy and development team:  1750\u00d7917 108 KB  If a proposed Signal Request is successful, GEG will create a formal proposal to acquire the necessary budget and onboard as the LMKR Core Unit. GEG will provide show treatments/budgets/sizzles into a content-marketing strategy package using YouTube, podcast platforms, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and MakerDAO\u2019s website. The Strategy Proposal will focus on getting LMKR content picked up by the DeFi news outlets and mainstream media: network, cable, and print such as CBS, CNN, CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, etc. GEG acknowledges their inexperience in crypto-related, global economics, and monetary policy production and not being crypto-native. What comes after this informal poll? If more than 50% of non-abstaining votes favor a 3-month development test, GEG will post a detailed MIP officially requesting funding for their development budget. If less than 50% show support, no further action will be taken by GEG. Here is the current poll outcome:  1752\u00d71067 186 KB     \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Change lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter The passing and introduction of the Rate Limiting Flapper have been successful, but it only allows to kick off a new auction if the new auction does not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid unless it\u2019s at the same value as the bump. Currently, the value for the lid is set to 150k Dai, which can run five flap auctions at once. However, ultraschuppi believes that there is no good reason to burn so much MKR and proposes setting the lid to the same value as bump - 30,000 Dai. Having a 1:1 \u2018lid\u2019 to \u2018bump\u2019 ratio will ensure that there is only one parallel flap auction running at any given time. What\u2019s good about this is that in the case of a huge spike on the System Surplus causing spillage to the Surplus Buffer, the time spread of those resulting auctions will be 5x compared to the current setting thereby producing a more steady burn. However, in sacrifice, we will limit the maximum of MKR burnt per day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai. Vote will run until May 13, 2022.

A Balance Sheet approach to executing an Aggressive Growth Strategy - The road to 300M revenues Joining the ongoing forum discussion on developing and executing an aggressive growth strategy, @SubVentures shared his approach based on balance sheet design. In recent weeks, @Subventures also published ALM framework for MakerDAO with collaborators and Towards taking asset risks - A primer.  Our current balance sheet is slightly underinvested and leaves about 9-11M DAI in annual revenues on the table.  We explore short-term bonds and ETH investment, as these assets don\u2019t depend on external factors. Both would increase profitability for MKR holders but will be constrained by the Surplus Buffer size     772\u00d7319 14 KB  As demonstrated, the main exposure we have (62%) is stablecoins, which don\u2019t need capital or bring revenues. The next item is crypto-backed loans, bringing 90% of revenues while only 35% of our exposure and 88% of the needed capital. DeFi Money Markets are far behind, as well as RWA. Option 1a: Optimize current activity by investing excess capital in short-term bonds. In short-term bonds, investing excess capital (current Surplus Buffer minus capital at risk of the previous model) would allow a 373M DAI investment. This investment would provide 9M DAI of additional revenues, push the RoE to 122%, and Price to Sales to 5.3%.  779\u00d7417 14.8 KB  Option 1b: Optimize current activity by investing excess capital in ETH. Allocating the current excess Surplus Buffer to ETH would only enable an investment of 13M to keep the CaR within the current Surplus Buffer. However, despite the small investment size, it would lead to an 11M Dai increase in annual revenue, though ETH RoA will be quite volatile compared to short-term bonds.  780\u00d7419 14.6 KB  The Strategic Finance Core Unit recommends a mixed allocation of short-term bonds and ETH. The community will determine the final allocation.  Trying to model the Aggressive Growth Strategy, we learn that a capital raise could be accretive and that scalable asset types are important  Even with a significant growth plan (+2B crypto-backed loans, +300M RWA, +1B crypto D3M), it is not enough to deploy all our asset base if we can\u2019t rely on scalable asset types (e.g., short-term bonds, ETH). Assuming full deployment of our asset base (through the expected plan or with only short-term bonds), the capital raise (issuing MKR tokens) is accretive for MKR holders (i.e., it increases their earnings). Using a debt offering at 10% is accretive as well. The structure of the debt issuance is not discussed but is assumed to be equity-like (which might not be the case).   Adopting a diversified and liquid balance sheet approach would increase 300M revenues.  This would give 304M annual revenues vs. the current 76M    A proposal by a team of several different members of different Core Units for raising capital and debt to finance an aggressive growth strategy suggested increasing exposure through the use of three primary levers:  Institutional Vaults: Tailored crypto vaults (ETH, WBTC) for institutions Real-world assets Multi-chain expansion: This is about deploying Maker MCD on L2 or a different L1 and/or providing D3M-style liquidity to crypto- lending platforms.  We investigate a model that satisfies several conditions: * Increase of 2B Dai in crypto-backed loans through Institutional Vaults and L2 MCD deployments Increase of 1B Dai in DeFi Money Markets with new D3M for Compound, Fuse, and others * Increase of 300M Dai in RWA * Keeping a 15% buffer in stablecoins * The remaining is invested in short-term bonds * The gap between the current surplus buffer and the Capital at Risk of this allocation is raised on the market at the current MKR price   784\u00d7465 19 KB  This increase in exposure will push the required Surplus Buffer to 157M Dai, meaning 87M Dai will be left to be raised. If we raised it 100% in equity, it would cost the protocol about 48K MKR (assuming the price stays the same), which corresponds to a 5.4% dilution for current MKR holders. Meeting these targets would increase revenues to 187M DAI annually. This represents a Sales to Price of 11%, whereas previous scenarios only achieved up to 5.4%. The Return over Equity is down to 119% and decreases as we rely less on high-RoE crypto-backed loans. This scenario could also be financed through debt, resulting in a lower RoE but higher Sales to Price. Option 2a: Extending exposure to short-term bonds is favorable even under a no-growth scenario  783\u00d7398 18.2 KB  Even using a worst-case model, in which we \u201cinvest in short term bonds and essentially limit ourselves to investing our excess float for our current debt capacity,\u201d we would end up with a 2.8B exposure in short-term bonds, while the newly raised capital would still be fully used. Even in this worst-case scenario, the capital raise would be favorable for current MKR holders, with a Sales to Price of 9.6%. Option 2b: Adding ETH to the mix is even more favorable  776\u00d7485 20.2 KB  We use the following conditions in our model for adding ETH to the asset mix:  Increase of 2B DAI in crypto-backed loans through Institutional Vaults and L2 MCD deployments Increase of 1B DAI in DeFi Monet Markets with new D3M for Compound, Fuse, and others Increase of 300M DAI in RWA Investing 100M DAI in ETH Keeping a 15% buffer in stablecoins The remaining is invested in short-term bonds. The gap between the current surplus buffer and the Capital at Risk of this allocation is raised on the market at the current MKR price.  As demonstrated, adding 100M Dai worth of ETH increases the capital raise by 91M. Impact analysis of three environmental factors:  Diversifying and building stronger liquidity can further optimize the balance sheet and improve outcomes.  776\u00d7459 19.7 KB   We conclude that having a high-level model is good to focus the protocol on what kind of balance sheet it wants to target and how:  We should focus first on what mix of asset types we are targeting Then, focus on starting with asset items that are scalable so we can allocate the balance sheet quickly in a focused way Then optimize the mix by adding non-scalable assets   908\u00d7599 16.9 KB  Note: The full post is long and in-depth. Suppose you\u2019re interested in a deeper investigation of these ideas, head over to the full post here.  Monetalis Evolution @Allan_Pedersen, CEO of Monetalis, made a post on the evolution and strategy of Monetalis. The post opens with a brief outline of the Monetalis strategy for DeFi/TradFi integration: \u201cOur approach\u2026is to focus on scaling volumes fast using a solid integration point that requires limited changes to the day-to-day business of both TradFi/DeFi.\u201d Furthermore, the Monetalis team believes that the DeFi/TradFi integration market is based on cooperation rather than competition. Three interacting components make up Monetalis\u2019 business. 1. Arena: Off-chain/on-chain DeFi/TradFi integration point While the team believes they have developed a \u201csatisfactory and strong\u201d starting solution, key areas to focus on for improvement include:  Reacting to regulatory changes and considering jurisdictions and legal format Working with multiple operational parties (banks, trustees, accounting, auditors) on streamlining and securing operations Evolving the off-chain/on-chain mapping and functionality Evolving governance design Continued risk management oversight across the operational design  2. Clydesdale: Confidence building & escalating solution: Institutional asset manager integration It\u2019s no secret that traditional financial institutions have hesitated to plunge into crypto. If we want to \u201cgo through the front door and work with the core of the business,\u201d we need a \u201cboil a frog\u201d approach. Monetalis\u2019 tasks in managing relationships with these institutions are to:  Create confidence and acceptance of integration point Analyse their offerings and match the right offerings up with the right protocol and needs Operationalise connection/relationship between institutions and protocol via integration point Monitor and report satisfactorily for both parties Continually improve and increase the sophistication of solutions and interactions  What is MIP65 Clydesdale set to accomplish for Maker?  Sits directly on an Arena structure Onboards one (or two) large financial institutions and have them provide:  If one, a base strategy of simple, highly liquid, safe bonds via ETF products If two, then also a base customized, liquid, a long-term bond strategy via segregated account mechanics   Allow the community to evaluate the above financial institutions and strategies and make a community choice in terms of chosen strategy and partner. Allows Maker to simply expand the sophistication of strategy with the same institution Sets out a path to onboard other institutions as their relevant strategic strengths become appropriate for Maker\u2019s ALM strategy. Develops credibility with institutions as a performing, convenient, professional, and long-term investor.  3. Lusitano: Example & innovation: Asset management team onboarding Monetalis wants to develop a flexible platform on top of the integration point to streamline taking on and managing new investment teams. Advantages of MIP68 Lusitano include:  Onboards the first team with proven performance in a specific asset class Safely stages first teams deployment in scalable market meeting investment grade standard, in-market structure, and return - and meets a min long-term net 2%+ yield requirement to Maker and realize the clean money initiative in practice Built on solid, flexible Bond structure interacting with Arena - a structure that can be expanded to include further investment teams with other asset class focus and allows appropriate protocol direct insight and oversight via Arena.   My involvement with Monetalis MakerDAO founder @rune published a brief post explaining his involvement with Monetalis, citing concerns that his interest in the company has been a \u201cmajor distraction.\u201d Due to this issue, Rune has decided to give away his shares and end any involvement with Monetalis as an insider. The plan for offloading his shares involves creating an independent foundation to take ownership of them, a structure already in use for other companies in the Maker ecosystem. New Competitive Idea: Covered Call Option Selling on Vault Collateral @Leritu, who has a background in selling options, proposed an idea for a covered call option selling vault collateral. The short version: \u201cUse an identical interface to ThetaNuts.Finance and allow vault holders to sell covered calls against their collateral.\u201d This idea would generate yield for our vault holders on their collateral, possibly more than they can achieve through interest accrued via their loans. @Leritu looks at three different hypothetical scenarios to make their point. Scenario #1: WBTC is at $40,000, the strike price of the covered call is sold at $50,000, and WBTC does not hit the $50,000 strike price by the time of the option\u2019s expiration. In this scenario, our vault holder gets awarded the premium for selling that covered call\u2014a win for everyone. Scenario #2: WBTC is at $40,000, the strike price of the covered call is sold at $50,000, and WBTC moves above the strike price at the time of expiration. In this scenario, the vault holder can allow the collateral to be called away; the vault holder gets the proceeds of the sale and the premium for selling the covered call minus any outstanding Dai debt. There is no under collateralization risk for the Maker protocol in this scenario. Scenario #3: WBTC is at $40,000, the strike price of the covered call is sold at $50,000, and WBTC drops to where the vault has to be liquidated. The covered call\u2019s strike price is further from the current market price in this scenario. To avoid certain risks, the covered call position would either be closed at the time of the vault liquidation (likely at a profit to the vault holder), or the covered call position could be auctioned off to be assumed by a vault keeper for the duration of the option contract. In this scenario, the premium harvested for selling the option is available to pay back outstanding Dai in the event of a liquidation that fails to repay all of it. Summarizing the key points, @Leritu concludes:  We know that options, and their popularity in DeFi, are going to play a larger and larger role in our ecosystem if we can be seen as an early player via a very low risks strategy (covered calls) \u2013 that gives us a unique advantage over AAVE and other competitors. By offering covered call selling, we allow our vault holders the opportunity to generate an income stream that may entirely offset their interest expense. If we choose to \u201chold\u201d the option selling premium in the vault until the option contract\u2019s expiration, we lower the chance of a vault liquidation being insufficient to pay back all outstanding Dai.   Lending Market Analysis - Cross-Collateralization Market Opportunity he Strategic Finance Core Unit analyzed the lending market to explore how Maker could quickly increase revenues by about $1.06M. In summary:  AAVE v2 has been increasing market share vs. COMP v2 and Maker since 2/24/2022. Most of this growth is in a small number of huge accounts, many of which use WBTC and ETH blended collateral. We estimate conservatively that a WBTC+ETH blended vault could increase revenue by about $1.06M. This revenue estimate can be used to determine the priority of adding blended vault capability.  The general stablecoin lending market has not held onto its momentum since late 2021. Recent growth mostly comes from borrows greater than $10M and is almost exclusively driven by AAVE. AAVE V2\u2019s stablecoin lending market share has been significantly increasing since February 24th, 2022.  Looking at \u201ceach AAVE v2 stablecoin borrower who has had at least $10M of net stablecoin borrow on any day since February 24th,\u201d the post aims to answer the question: \u201cWhy are these entities using AAVE instead of Maker?\u201d Trends  Trend: Many were borrowing against blended collateral of primarily WBTC and ETH.  Response: Maker could prioritize the capability to offer vaults with blended collateral and open one with WBTC and ETH   Trend: A fair portion was borrowing against just ETH. The relatively high ETH supply APR of 0.43%, most of which comes from ETH borrowers borrowing against stETH, effectively subsidizes the stablecoin borrow APR by about 0.7-2%, depending on LTV.  Response: Maker could prioritize the capability to offer vaults with rebasing tokens as collateral and open one with aETH   Trend: Some were borrowing stablecoins against stETH or a mixed bag of stETH and ETH.  Response: Tough to address this without potentially reducing profit from our existing stETH vaults as users were likely receiving better loan/liquidation parameters on AAVE.    The first trend regarding blended collateral of primarily WBTC and ETH is the most prominent. Investigating further, the team dug into two specific data points:  25.8% (dollar-weighted) of Maker borrowers of at least $100K are borrowing against multiple types of collateral. This amounts to ~$814M of borrowing. Note: Maker vaults not formed via DS Proxy contracts were excluded from this analysis, as it is impossible to ascertain ownership of those. 37.9% (dollar-weighted) of AAVE v2 stablecoin borrowers of at least $100K are borrowing primarily against WBTC and ETH. Namely, at least 20% of their collateral is in each, and at least 90% of their collateral is in the sum of WBTC and ETH. This amounts to $1.003B of stablecoin borrowing.  We can see a significant gap between these two data points. The authors ultimately conclude that attempting to close the gap via implementing a WBTC+ETH blended vault could increase revenue quickly by about $1.06M.  Ilk Names versus Display Names for Vault Types Thus far, Maker has tended to use ilk names (e.g., ETH-A, ETH-B, GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A) to refer to vault types in governance, forum discussions, and user interfaces. In this post, @LongForWisdom presents the GovAlpha team's solution for situations where ilk naming conventions present difficulties. Ilk names come with their own set of advantages:  Simplicity and shared terminology for communication and understanding. Direct link between changes in the code of executive spells and the commonly used names.  And disadvantages:  Ilk names cannot be (feasibly) changed. More complex collateral types end up with alphanumeric soup Ilk names: GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A, CRVV1ETHSTETH-A, etc. Some collateral types have names that are completely disconnected from the collateral: RWA001-A, RWA002-A, etc. Ilk naming conventions are pretty loose, and this can\u2019t easily be fixed. This leaves front-ends with the choice of:  Displaying the (often hard to parse) ilk name directly. Making up a display name (may be inconsistent with other front-ends)    Why is this being brought up now? With the introduction of the wstETH-C vault, there is no good ilk name to rely on. GovAlpha has decided to follow the technical convention for the low-leverage, low-fee wstETH, so the ilk-name will be wstETH-B, not wstETH-C, which has been in use so far. The full solution, involving adding a layer of abstraction to avoid the issue, is a common approach. In summary: \u201cIn this case, add a new canonical \u2018display-name\u2019 (controllable by Maker Governance) used in front-ends and discussion instead of the ilk-name. This mitigates most disadvantages, imposes relatively lightweight costs, and brings some advantages.\u201d To illustrate, here are some ilks with possible display names:     Ilk Display Name     ETH-A Ethereum Balanced   ETH-B Ethereum High Leverage   ETH-C Ethereum Low Fee   PSM-USDC-A USDC Peg Stability Module   RWA001-A 6s Capital   GUNIV3DAIUSDC1-A UniswapV3 0.01% Fee DAI-USDC Pair (Gelato)   CRVV1ETHSTETH-A stETH-ETH Pair (Curve)     Is Maker Protocol Running Deficit? Recognized Delegate Doo Nam made a clarification post asking if Makerburn\u2019s annual profit estimate, which shows the Maker protocol running at a deficit of nearly 2M Dai, is accurate.  851\u00d7532 45.6 KB  The Risk Core Unit team cleared up the issue, explaining that in 10 days, the expenses listed will rotate out, after which the estimate will once again be positive.    \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Change lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter The passing and introduction of the Rate Limiting Flapper have been successful, but it only allows to kick off a new auction if the new auction does not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid unless it\u2019s at the same value as the bump. Currently, the value for the lid is set to 150k Dai, which can run five flap auctions at once. However, ultraschuppi believes there is no good reason to burn so much MKR and proposes setting the lid to the same value as bump - 30,000 Dai. Having a 1:1 \u2018lid\u2019 to \u2018bump\u2019 ratio will ensure that there is only one parallel flap auction running at any given time. What\u2019s good about this is that in the case of a huge spike on the System Surplus causing spillage to the Surplus Buffer, the time spread of those resulting auctions will be 5x compared to the current setting thereby producing a more steady burn. However, we will limit the maximum MKR burnt per day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai in sacrifice. Vote will run until May 13, 2022. Here are the current voting results:  1695\u00d7682 87.1 KB   Deploy the balance sheet in ETH As expressed in Towards taking asset risk and A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy, ETH seems like a sound investment for MakerDAO. Sebastian from Strategic Finance moves forward on the Balance Sheet Approach towards an Aggressive Growth Strategy by gauging community sentiment on whether we would like to begin working on allocating some of the MakerDAO balance sheet into ETH and/or ETH derivatives and, if so, how much? He presents the pros and cons of potentially implementing this investment into ETH: Pros:  MakerDAO is using Ethereum as its home base and, therefore, linked to the success of ETH. ETH is a strategic asset for the operations of the DAO as it pays gas fees for on-chain transactions and oracles. Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO, and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet, and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage. The upcoming Merge will significantly reduce the issuance of new ETH and create a competitive market for balance sheets with a high degree of exposure to ETH. Post-Merge staking fees are currently estimated at 7-11%, doubling current staking yields overnight and making ETH a truly productive asset.  Cons:  ETH is a volatile asset whose ETH/DAI price can wildly fluctuate and occasionally go down over significant periods of time The Merge and L2 impacts can have unexpected long-term impacts on price.  Sebastian also notes that this Signal Request aims to understand whether there is a community desire to work on this topic. No priority is currently being attributed, and a formal implementation for such actions will have to go through the governance processes.

The Maker Wormhole (Now called Maker Teleport) Oracles will enable users to use the Wormhole bridge with speed and security that outpaces the existing competition. Learn more about how they work in Wormhole Oracle Overview.    Centrifuge Update: Cornerstone Agreement Complete to Onboard RWAs to Maker with Centrifuge Centrifuge and MakerDAO have finalized a cornerstone agreement to enable RWA onboarding at scale via the Centrifuge protocol: The Trust Indenture Agreement. In the coming weeks, @elidco and @christiancdpetersen will host an AMA to provide interested community members with an overview of the key points. What is a trust indenture? In short, a trust indenture is a contract used in a bond offering between the bond issuer and a trustee detailing the terms and conditions the trustee must adhere to and the rights of the trust beneficiaries (e.g., bondholders and tokenholders). A trust indenture also contains terms and conditions about the circumstances that may lead to a default and the process for handling this situation. Learn more about trust indentures in @elidco\u2019s explainer post.

Advance Notice G&R Time Change Trial - May 26 and June 30 GovAlpha and GovComms will be experimenting with a new time for the monthly Governance & Risk call. On Thursday, May 26, and Thursday, June 30, the next two meetings will be at 21:00 UTC. The time change aims to make the meeting more inclusive of interested community members whose time zones did not allow them to attend the meeting at its current 17:00 UTC timeslot, particularly those in Oceania and East Asia. Important Message - Media Due to recent events, all messages related to media queries should be directed to [email\u00a0protected]. Maker Wormhole new name: Maker Teleport  The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has been working on a product that will enable fast, secure cross-chain transfers, particularly between L2s. While the initial name chosen for this project was \u201cWormhole,\u201d Jump Trading has been building a bridge product with a similar name and has acquired wormhole.com as a brand asset. Given this state of affairs, the Protocol Engineering CU and the Brand Team have decided to rename Maker Wormhole to Maker Teleport.   Wormhole Oracle Overview Maker Wormhole enables users to withdraw quickly from an L2 chain to another L1 or L2 chain. To function properly, Wormhole smart contracts on the destination chain need to know when withdrawals happen on the source chain. Most L2 chains, Optimism, in particular, have a long delay between initiating the withdrawal and confirming the transaction. Maker will need to obtain withdrawal status using a different method to ensure a smooth user experience. The Maker Oracle can provide this information by utilizing its network of Oracle Feeders, which will now sign attestations about the occurrence of specific events on different blockchains and their current role of signing price information. Further Details Design Goals Design goals for Maker Wormhole include: strong resiliency and uptime, censorship resistance, minimizing requirements for running Oracle Feeders, and minimizing the attack surface against Feeders. Architecture  The basic process is: Step 1: Witness the withdrawal event. Step 2: Collect the attestations in a database. Step 3: Serve the attestations to end users via an API endpoint. Specific Features Some of the specific features of the Maker Wormhole system include support for multiple RPC nodes to protect from bad actors, a permissionless API endpoint so anyone can access Feeder attestations, and the use of the well-regarded libp2p protocol, which has strong spam resistance and allows for permissionless access to the network.  ALM Liquidity: 2022-05 While our stablecoin liquidity reserves have dropped by 2B in fewer than three months, they remain strong at their present level of 4B. But where did that 2B go? Four particular areas made sizable impacts: Bridges  The biggest drivers of lost liquidity are the Dai bridges to Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon. Crypto-backed Loans  Since the middle of February, the decrease in crypto loans, most attributable to Nexo taking market share, has been beneficial for Maker\u2019s stablecoin liquidity. The Curve Situation  The drop in the use of Dai is primarily attributable to Curve. Only 826M Dai remains deposited into the protocol, down from 2B at the start of the year. Half of this drop, @SebVentures argues, is directly attributable to the ongoing events surrounding the UST stablecoin, which resulted in many Curve users exiting into USDC and Dai (the other two stablecoins in the 3pool). While rebalancing the 3pool would increase our liquidity buffer, the strong amplification factor may not make it worthwhile. Secondary Lending  770\u00d7487 7.81 KB  Maker has lost about 500M on Compound and 250M on Aave. @SebVentures concludes his analysis by pointing out that organic demand for Dai, defined as Dai holdings in non-smart-contract addresses, has remained stable.  723\u00d7353 20 KB   Introduction to Precession Capital Adam Young (@precap) published a post introducing Precession Capital to the community before a formal application is submitted in the coming weeks. The team\u2019s own words: \u201cPrecession Capital Management LLC is an SEC-regulated, New York-based Investment Adviser specializing in asset-backed and structured credit portfolio management. Our management team has decades of experience structuring, managing, and investing in asset-backed securities and private credit transactions backed by real estate, consumer, and corporate assets.\u201d Precession believes that Maker\u2019s present reliance on over-collateralized crypto-assets can be reduced through the onboarding of real-world assets (RWA), which, if properly structured, can help create a stronger and more resilient peg for Dai. For a deeper dive into Precession Capital, look at this more detailed overview.   \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Launch Maker Teleport with 1 basis point fee Maker Teleport, known until recently as Maker Wormhole, will launch with two key advantages over other asset bridges:  Teleport will allow users to withdraw L2 funds at near-instant speeds by side-stepping the need to wait for fraud-proof. Teleport will burn Dai on the origin chain and mint it on the destination chain without any need for a centralized party.  With these features in place, Maker Teleport is expected to be faster and more secure than an existing competitor; even with a one basis point fee, Teleport is estimated to remain 75-99% cheaper than competing protocols. While one basis point may seem low, the Strategic Finance Core Unit believes that Teleport will experience strong growth, leading to significant revenues for Maker. Teleport Fee Parameters per Domain  Set the Arbitrum Wormhole Fee parameter to 1 bp Set the Optimism Wormhole Fee parameter to 1 bp  The vote will run until May 19th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1702\u00d7797 135 KB   Maker Accessing Mortgage loans Through Bacon Protocol This proposal from @abdalla requests the onboarding of a Dai Direct Deposit Module (D3M) to create a Bacon Protocol Dai pool. BaconCoin is a stablecoin backed by US mortgages. Potential benefits include:  A single onboarding procedure that can scale both the amount of capital used and the number of home loans over time Broad distribution of Dai to homeowners in the US Higher risk-adjusted yields across a diversified set of home loans Maker selects the underwriting criteria to use, allowing for investing in loans that are highly aligned with Maker\u2019s vision of funding sustainability initiatives Bacon will develop and maintain the D3M integration in line with the CES enablement strategy Governance has direct control over the Dai supply added to Bacon through the Debt Ceiling  @abdalla lists smart contract risk as a potential con but also offers two ideas for mitigating risks:  Whitelisting addresses with deposit functionality can reduce exploit risk (Maker would be the only liquidity provider) Credit risk assessment of borrowers can be performed by loan originators using the industry-standard FICO score  The vote will run until May 19th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1695\u00d7685 112 KB   Increase the ESM Minimum Threshold GovAlpha submitted a Signal Request to gauge support for increasing the minimum threshold to trigger the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) from 100,000 MKR to 150,000 MKR. GovAlpha recommends this adjustment to minimize the threat of a hostile emergency shutdown occurring. With the recent fall in the MKR price, triggering an emergency shutdown has become significantly cheaper based on the current minimum threshold. The goal is to find the right balance between making it very expensive for a bad actor to acquire or borrow enough MKR to trigger an emergency shutdown without making it overly difficult for a legitimate emergency shutdown to be triggered if necessary (for example, in response to the discovery of a critical bug in the Maker Protocol or the prevention of a malicious governance attack). The vote will run until May 20th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1700\u00d7702 110 KB   Antalpha Institutional Vault @William_Chiu has compiled recent discussions between the Growth, Risk, and Protocol Engineering Core Unites and Antalpha to propose a new institutional vault. The post outlines both the goals of the proposal and the mechanisms for achieving them. Goals  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability  Mechanisms  Boosting DAI Supply Generating greater revenue for MakerDAO and our partners Enhancing capital efficiency for our partners Longer-term borrowing commitment with a level of borrowing rate-predictability-   Origination fee: will be applied to all DAI at the time of minting. This is not restricted and is open to change via Governance (specifically the Parameter Changes Proposal group). Meaning that any partner will have a lead time of 2-3 weeks before any changes are implemented. Stability fee: is determined upfront and fixed for a period of time. This fixed rate can be reduced as additional collateral is added. Vault starting size: to ensure that such vaults will mint a minimum amount of DAI to gain favorable rates. Antalpha intends to utilize a DAI loan to strengthen the stable coin portion of the balance sheet to support one of its primary lending and borrowing businesses. Antalpha will take on collateral at a higher level than the level borrowing from DAI to implement proper credit risk management and utilize systems and algorithmic trading to facilitate managing the loans and collateral.  Proposed Terms     Institutional Vault Type Permissioned ETH and wBTC Vaults (INST-WBTC-5, INST-ETH-5)     Qualifying Vault size: 200MM   Debt Ceiling 1B, 500MM for ETH, and 500MM for wBTC   Origination fee: 1% of DAI minted   Origination fee behavior: Origination fee is not restricted and can be changed through Governance via a Parameter Changes Proposal. Antalpha has a 2-3 week lead-time to any Origination fee rate change.   Origination fee future commitments Maker and Antalpha will work together to propose reductions to the origination fee if the vault size grows significantly.   Stability fee: WBTC-A stability fee1 - 50bps & ETH-A stability fee2 - 50bps   Stability fee3 behavior: Fixed for six months. After the 200m DAI minted, an additional 100m DAI minted will reduce the stability fee by ten basis points (per vault) to a minimum of Stability fee-30bps for six months. The stability fee reduction will be manual via an executive vote. After six months, open community dialogue facilitated by the Growth CU will determine ongoing stability fees.   Collateral Ratio: 150%   Collateral Ratio Behavior: Failure to maintain 200% CR4 over the majority of seven days will increase the SF to 5% and the LR to 150%. The seven days would be calculated by ensuring that 95% of the OSM updates show that the CR is equal to or greater than 200%.   Liquidation Ratio: 120%     Here are the current voting results:  1690\u00d7690 116 KB   The vote will run until May 19th, 2022 Restart The Burn @aburban90 presents his request in favor of reactivating the MKR burn. He states that shutting down the burn also shut down our only revenue distribution model and that we have yet to replace it with anything better. These actions have caused some OG stakeholders to lose faith in our ability to deliver. Our community and stakeholders are very important, and there is a possibility we may be risking their confidence in us if we continue not to burn MKR during times of such low prices. In conclusion, Andrew asks the community whether we want to restart the burn with a reduced lid parameter to mitigate many of the inefficiencies. The vote will run until May 14th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1697\u00d7690 114 KB   Deploy the balance sheet in ETH As expressed in Towards taking asset risk and A balance sheet approach to an Aggressive Growth Strategy, ETH seems like a sound investment for MakerDAO. Sebastian from Strategic Finance moves forward on the Balance Sheet Approach toward an Aggressive Growth Strategy by gauging community sentiment on whether we would like to begin working on allocating some of the MakerDAO balance sheets into ETH and/or ETH derivatives. He presents the pros and cons of potentially implementing this investment into ETH: Pros:  MakerDAO is using Ethereum as its home base and is therefore linked to the success of ETH. ETH is a strategic asset for the operations of the DAO because it pays gas fees for on-chain transactions and oracles. Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO, and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet, and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage. The upcoming Merge will significantly reduce the issuance of new ETH and create a competitive market for balance sheets with a high degree of exposure to ETH. Post-Merge staking fees are currently estimated at 7-11%, doubling current staking yields overnight and making ETH a truly productive asset.  Cons:  ETH is a volatile asset whose ETH/DAI price can wildly fluctuate and occasionally go down over significant periods The Merge and L2 impacts can have unexpected long-term impacts on price.  Sebastian also notes that this Signal Request aims to understand whether there is a community desire to work on this topic. No priority is currently being attributed, and a formal implementation for such actions will have to go through the governance processes. The vote will run until May 12th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1702\u00d7902 193 KB   Change lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter The passing and introduction of the Rate Limiting Flapper have been successful. However, it only allows to kick off a new auction if it does not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid unless it is at the same value as the bump. Currently, the value for the lid is set to 150k Dai, which can run five flap auctions at once. However, ultraschuppi believes there is no good reason to burn so much MKR and proposes setting the lid to the same value as bump - 30,000 Dai. Having a 1:1 \u2018lid\u2019 to \u2018bump\u2019 ratio will ensure that there is only one parallel flap auction running at any given time. What is good about this is that in the case of a huge spike on the System Surplus causing spillage to the Surplus Buffer, the time spread of those resulting auctions will be 5x compared to the current setting, thereby producing a more steady burn. However, we will limit the maximum MKR burnt per day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai in sacrifice. Vote will run until May 13, 2022.

Links reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.   \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  MIP4c2-SP15, an amendment to the Core Unit offboarding process, has been published. The goal of the proposed process is to minimize collateral damage to MakerDAO and the community in the event of Core Unit disruptions. The Growth Core Unit is requesting the subdomain nature.makerdao.com for an upcoming campaign involving planting trees each time a Maker Vault is opened and offering POAPs to Vault owners. MakerDAO has the opportunity to determine which assets should be included in the Maker Basepool, a proposed liquidity pool on Curve containing DAI together with other low-risk stablecoins.    No Executive Proposal - 2022-06-01 GovAlpha announces their decision with Protocol Engineering to skip the upcoming Executive Vote of July 1st, 2022. This is due to a lack of proposals or items requiring inclusion in the next Executive Vote. GovAlpha will still post weekly polls next week, with a number expected to go live on Monday, May 30th. July 8th, 2022, will continue with the regular Executive Vote cadence. Governance Stats and Tracker Dashboard  761\u00d7215 10.1 KB  GovAlpha has introduced v1 of its Governance Dashboard, providing visualization tools for important stats and metrics related to governance and delegation.  Some of the data available includes:  MKR delegated and delegator count for all recognized and shadow delegates, as well as total amounts for all delegates Total and individual amount of MKR staked and delegated Current and historical vote weights for delegates Number of poll voters per month   The Tracker section includes GovAlpha\u2019s Governance Tracker, together with extra functionality, such as custom filters for active proposals, high-impact proposals, and proposals ending this week.  Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management - 2022-05-24 The Growth Core Unit is requesting to activate the subdomain nature.makerdao.com and connect it to a new website for a campaign called Nature. Nature is the result of a partnership between MakerDAO, One Tree Planted, and Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP). Because opening a Maker Vault involves a certain amount of computing power and storage on the Ethereum blockchain, it impacts the environment. The goal of Nature is to balance out this carbon footprint by planting trees every time a Vault is opened. Opening a Vault will also result in the issuance of a POAP badge claimable by the Vault owner.

[Informal Poll] Curve Basepool Composition The Maker Basepool is a proposed integration with Curve involving a new stablecoin liquidity pool (LP) containing DAI and other low-risk, fiat-backed stablecoins. Focusing on low-risk stablecoins allows the Basepool LP to be onboarded as a collateral asset, increasing its total locked value and capital efficiency. Like the existing 3pool LP, the Basepool could serve as a pair asset for other stablecoin LPs, and Maker could offer collateral support to these metapools. This brings several potential benefits to MakerDAO, including:  Increased revenue from stablecoin reserves (which are currently idle in PSMs) An improved relationship with the Curve community and increased influence on Curve governance Improved relationships with third-party stablecoin issuers that utilize Basepool liquidity  Read the full Basepool proposal draft here. Implementation Process The expected implementation steps are:  Deploy the Basepool LP on Curve  The current poll will help determine pool composition   Submit a MIP6 proposal for Basepool collateral onboarding to MakerDAO Submit a Curve DAO vote to enable pairing with Basepool through Curve\u2019s pool factory Implement and onboard the Basepool LP vault using a modified cropjoin adapter Deploy a gauge contract Submit a Curve DAO vote to add gauge rewards to the Basepool Submit a Curve DAO vote to whitelist MakerDAO for CRV locking  Possible alternative strategies to deploy CRV include Aave and Curve LPs   Investigate onboarding Basepool metapools Implement a metagovernance mechanism for managing veCRV votes Implement an mkrCRV liquid staking wrapper  Maker now has an opportunity to determine the composition of the Basepool\u2019s stablecoin reserves. Options:   USDC is the most widely used onshore fiat stablecoin. Maker already heavily integrates with USDC, so risk exposure would be increased minimally, if at all.  BUSD is the second-largest US-based stablecoin, with wide usage across the Binance CEX and DeFi ecosystems.  USDP is issued by Paxos and is a small-cap onshore stablecoin. Maker currently represents 50% or more of the USDP in circulation, which is already a relatively high share of assets.  GUSD is a relatively small-cap onshore stablecoin. It has a strong legal and backing structure and is managed independently by other stablecoin providers.  Another question to consider is how many assets the Basepool should include. The more assets included, the higher the gas fees and slightly higher credit and default risk.   Option #1: DAI, USDC  The most minimal pool implementation possible, with a lower distribution of credit risks as well as somewhat lower swap gas costs    Option #2: DAI, USDC, BUSD  Not yet integrated through a PSM, which could impact pool stability and may require a somewhat lower amplification parameter to maintain stability.    Option #3: DAI, USDC, USDP, GUSD  Maker already integrates each stablecoin through the PSM, so the pool should remain well-balanced even with high amplification parameters.    The author of the poll, @monet-supply, believes that Option #2 offers the best combination of utility and strategic benefit while minimizing liquidity risks. Visit the forum post for more details on the different composition options for the Basepool and to cast your vote. This poll will run through this weekend.  Compensation levels in a global organization Building on a comment from the ongoing MKR holder Confessional thread, @purrfection opens the floor for discussion about how contributor compensation might work best in a global organization like MakerDAO. @purrfection opens the discussion by arguing that global organizations should not be paying developed-world salaries to contributors in developing countries.  725\u00d7132 24.1 KB  Others, such as @CodeKnight, argue that adjusting salaries based on geography is unfair and may sow division.  787\u00d7144 26.8 KB  @juan contends that money shouldn\u2019t be the key factor in new hires anyway\u2014quality should be.  781\u00d7761 97.5 KB  Discussion is ongoing; join in here.  Investment Committee Work / food for thought @Allan_Pedersen published a post exploring an analogy for how delegates may want to think about their role at MakerDAO: as members of an Investment Committee (IC). Some facts about ICs:  Fairly small in size Members are the core people the LP or capital provider is betting on to deliver returns Many have independent members to provide an outside perspective A unanimous \u201cyes\u201d vote is generally required for a proposal to pass  Pressures faced by ICs include:  A set of real legal responsibilities in terms of investment care and duties Personal wealth is locked up in and dependent on investment performance Bad returns could lead to no further funds raised  With these facts in mind, ICs significantly influence the entire deal process. Typically, deal teams are established on an ad-hoc basis from the fund\u2019s pool of talent, and each active deal is appointed a Deal Lead, who is often a Partner and a member of the IC. Deal processes tend to have three primary decision \u201cgates,\u201d all of which the IC is heavily involved. Gate 1: Do we want to investigate and shape a potential deal? i.e., Do we allocate internal manpower to this deal and start a deal team? Gate 2: Should we sign the term sheet? i.e., Do we accept the deal as it stands, and are we willing to spend the money on the necessary advisors (legal/auditing/etc.)? Gate 3: Should we sign the final agreements and execute them? i.e., Do we execute the transaction\u2014or not? For more details on these deal processes and the role of IC members in guiding and directing deals, check out the full post.  Classification and cleanup of the makerdao GitHub - Request for comments This post outlines plans to clean up and categorize repositories in the MakerDAO GitHub to help make it easier to manage them. The post specifies four categories different MakerDAO repositories can be categorized into:  Most repositories on the MakerDAO GitHub are used for software development. It is important to make sure that this software is easy to work with, is open source, and that the copyright is assigned to the Dai Foundation so that the software remains a public good.  These repositories will be assigned to a Core Unit willing to take responsibility for the software.       When a repository is used for informational purposes, this is considered communicating on behalf of MakerDAO. In other words, it becomes an intangible MakerDAO asset, and the right to manage content in it has to go through the same process as for any other intangible MakerDAO asset.   These repositories will be assigned to a Core Unit willing to take content ownership and be assigned as content managers.     Repositories that hold software that no MakerDAO Core Unit is ready to maintain and isn\u2019t considered under active development but are still part of the Maker protocol (e.g., an early auction keeper).  These repositories will be archived. They will be public but read-only.   Repositories that hold software not used in the Maker protocol.  These repositories will be archived and made private.     {New} MIP4c2-SP15: Core Unit Offboarding Process Amendments In light of recent events such as the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit, this proposal aims to streamline and standardize the Core Unit offboarding process. The stated goal is \u201cto reduce harm to the DAO and community in the event of Core Unit disruptions.\u201d More specific, lower-level goals include:  Solidifying the Core Unit offboarding process, which requires:  Simplifying and templatizing the process of offboarding. Clarifying offboarding terms in the governance cycle. Establishing a standard for proposers.   Introducing and formatting expectations about timelines, work plans, and budgets. Making the offboarding process reference the new Core Unit Budget process, which is currently pending approval. Adding templates where appropriate or finalizing WIP from the original MIP4. Proposing an unwinding plan for Core Units with legacy budgets now that the revised MIP40 has arrived.   Wintec Reintroduction @DavidJeng, CEO of Wintec Industries, posted a \u201creintroduction\u201d to catch the MakerDAO community up on Wintec\u2019s activities since its MIP6 submissions in May 2021. Over the past year, Wintec has continued to deploy hundreds of millions in capital into their customers\u2019 supply chain assets from existing funding sources. Wintec initially planned to pilot with 20 million DAI, with plans to scale to 50-100 million DAI in the following 12-18 months, and this target remains unchanged. We\u2019re all familiar with the supply shocks brought on first by global pandemic lockdowns, then by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. What do these supply chain shocks mean for Wintec?  Wintec is seeing nearly double the rate of opportunities than in the previous few years. Wintec continues to engage with existing institutional financing partners to match them with customer demand. Wintec is excited about innovations in the Maker ecosystem that could position Maker as a large, credible, global capital provider.   Off-Chain Governance Incentive Changes (SourceCred) This post summarizes the off-chain incentive changes detailed in both forum posts below, which will be taking place beginning in June 2022. Off-Chain Proposal Bounties GovAlpha posted an Off-Chain Governance List of Options and Recommendations toward the end of February this year that contained a poll to help determine which recommendation the community prefers:  1747\u00d71480 347 KB  After some hard work behind the scenes, GovAlpha presents its strategy to improve the MakerDAO off-chain incentive system and explains the reasons and expectations. Introducing the new off-chain proposal bounties: an off-chain reward system incentivizes concrete and outcome-producing governance initiatives! This proposal comes to remedy the limitations of SourceCred and develop certain complementary strategies to improve the system as a whole. GovAlpha believes this initiative will strengthen our governance process through direct incentives for concrete governance actions, encouraging community members to trigger governance processes with tangible results. A new pool of 72,000 DAI in funds will be created alongside this proposal. The initiative consists of 6,000 DAI per month to be distributed among all successful and eligible MakerDAO governance proposals. Any community member with an official forum account can receive off-chain proposal bounty payouts. How do you determine an eligible governance proposal? Well, GovAlpha deems a proposal eligible for a payout if it meets the following criteria:  Successful MIP proposals Successful MIP Sub Proposals Successful Signal Requests  A proposal is considered successful if its on-chain vote meets the success criteria defined in the accompanying on-chain poll text. But let\u2019s dig into the reward system; the maximum reward for each type of successful proposal is as follows: MIP - 2,000 DAI Sub Proposal - 1,000 DAI Signal - 500 DAI The reward pool for a given month is split between proposals according to the following weights: MIP = 1 Sub Proposal = 1/2 Signal = \u00bc There are several eligibility exceptions and exclusions, which we recommend checking out in the original post.  Delegate SourceCred Recognized delegates are compensated for the quantity and quality of their engagements on the MakerDAO forum as judged by the rest of the community via the SourceCred mechanism. However, there has previously been discussion on whether SourceCred payments are ethical and appropriate for a full-time Recognized Delegate. The issue is that a delegate\u2019s exclusion from SourceCred payouts may interrupt their processes. In response to this, GovAlpha aims to present a new Delegate SourceCred reward mechanism with which the GovAlpha Core Unit will assess and reward the engagement and community participation of Recognized Delegates. GovAlpha continues researching for the best alternative, but in the meantime, they believe it is important to maintain off-chain incentives for a growing group of actors that play an increasingly strategic role within the ecosystem. GovAlpha identified that SourceCred payout challenges have more to do with the contributors\u2019 differences than with the algorithm design. To mitigate the effects generated by these differences, GovAlpha has designed two changes:  A separate Delegate SourceCred fund is created to compensate for Recognized Delegate engagement. Rewards are distributed outside the existing SourceCred instance and through a new distribution formula.   52,000 DAI annually will be allocated to the Recognized Delegate reward pool. This breaks down to 4,000 DAI total distributed to delegates per month based on their engagement in the MakerDAO forum. In 5-week months, the monthly amount to be distributed will be 5,000 DAI.  Cred for delegates is calculated using a custom algorithm based on raw weekly cred scores in a three-step process:  First, the algorithm selects the week evaluated for a specific delegate. Then, it filters out all of the actions that are not relevant for the scope of this calculation (user mentions, inter-week cred interactions, and cred lost for likes given). Finally, it counts and stores the cred that\u2019s left in the selection.  Let\u2019s discuss eligibility. Any Recognized Delegate with one or more official forum accounts is eligible to receive delegate engagement payouts for one account only. Recognized Delegates must opt-in and confirm which forum account is accruing engagement payouts. A Recognized Delegate is only eligible for engagement payouts in a given month if they meet the criteria in MIP61 to receive a non-zero amount of compensation for that month. GovAlpha is aiming to start implementing the new Delegate SourceCred in June.    \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn @rema submits a signal request replacing the previous Signal by Andrew Burban to restart the burn. This Signal is a trial of the new MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations, which defines the process used to agree and enact permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. It will now be tested for effectiveness through this Signal Request. The Risk Core Unit believes that confronted with a potential crypto winter and global economic recession, it now is crucial for the MakerDAO community to reach a consensus about what to do regarding the surplus buffer. Their solution involves maintaining a sustainable surplus buffer higher than the current level to support risk mitigation and growth while burning a relatively small amount of the surplus buffer to clarify that \u201cburning still is, and will remain, an integral part of MakerDAO and our community.\u201d The vote will run until June 9th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1715\u00d7667 92.4 KB   Incoming Velodrome Airdrop on Optimism - $VELO veNFT Velodrome is an AMM modeled on Solidly and designed to be a public good that provides deep liquidity and low slippage to token pairs. MakerDAO is eligible to receive an airdrop of veNFT equivalent to 1% of the initial voting power for the new Velodrome protocol launching on Optimism on May 31st.  The veNFT will allow MakerDAO to direct emissions to the liquidity pools of their choosing, increasing liquidity of the chosen pairs and receiving all trading fees and bribes for those pools\u2026Strategic Finance believes that Velodrome could be a significant contender for amassing DAI liquidity on Optimism.  The Velodrome team requested to initially manage the veNFT on MakerDAO\u2019s behalf until their DAO is ready to manage it. They proposed both DAI/USDC and DAI/OP pairs for launch to ensure emissions are high enough to attract adequate liquidity. In response, Aes is asking the community the following questions:  Should MakerDAO incentivize the pairs recommended by the Velodrome team? Should MakerDAO transfer veNFT to a Governance-owned multi-sig using MIP47? What should MakerDAO do with the trading fees?  More information on Velodrome can be found on their Medium. The vote will run until June 9th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1695\u00d7675 140 KB   1687\u00d7725 169 KB   1687\u00d7975 182 KB   Request Minting of new MKR Tokens to Replace MKR Tokens Inadvertently Sent to MKR Token Address (Burned) wingstick_99942 inadvertently sent 3.1994 MKR to the MKR Governance Address and submitted a follow-up Signal Request in hopes of successfully requesting an exact number of new MKR tokens to be minted and returned to the sender\u2019s address since the existing tokens are inaccessible. The vote will run until June 8th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1702\u00d7695 114 KB   Offboard UNI, UNIV2DAIETH, UNIV2WBTCETH, UNIV2UNIETH, and UNIV2WBTCDAI The CMON (Collateral Management On-chain) initiative and its stakeholders prepared this Signal Request and its stakeholders, including different CES-led core units. Due to lack of demand and consequent negative cash flow, they propose offboarding UNI-A, UNIV2DAIETH-A, UNIV2WBTCETH-A, UNIV2UNIETH-A, and UNIV2WBTCDAI-A. The main problem with these vault types is pure lack of demand, as the underlying assets (ETH, WBTC, and UNI) have relatively high on-chain liquidity. MOMC attempted to make them more attractive by lowering the SF at the end of January, but demand, unfortunately, didn\u2019t increase. Proposed parameters were set in a way where we try to minimize the damage done to existing vault owners while ensuring that sufficient amounts of debt will either be repaid or, less desirably, liquidated with minimal costs for the vault owners. Proposed parameter changes;  Set liquidation penalty to 0% Set debt ceiling to 0 Set tip to 0 Set duration of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio to 30 days Set the end parameter of dss-lerp for liquidation ratio for each vault type as the following: highest collateral ratio vault within each vault type multiplied by 3, rounded to the hundreds.  The vote ends TODAY, May 26, at 22:00 UTC. If the outcome is \u201cyes,\u201d on-chain polls will be held; otherwise, the Signal Request will be reinitiated with different parameters and/or strategies.

Links reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.   Three-Point Summary \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  GovAlpha published a post-mortem regarding a proposal that was mistakenly archived and marked as accepted, plus measures for avoiding similar events in the future. The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Legal Research team made a post highlighting the need for developing a legal review process for new governance proposals, which have the potential to carry serious legal and regulatory consequences. A discussion post about GFX\u2019s upcoming Interest Protocol and whether Maker should view the new project as a direct competitor has already drawn more than 45 comments.    News and Announcements Missed Proposal Post-Mortem A clerical error led to a proposal that had not yet been voted on being mistakenly archived and marked as accepted on the MakerDAO forum. This happened because a MIP with the same title passed right before the new proposal was submitted. The mistakenly archived MIP will be included in next week's ratification polls. This solution means the MIP will be voted on one month later than it otherwise would have, as well as losing visibility by being removed early from the RFC (Request for Comment) category. In addition to the duplicate title, there were a number of other contributing factors that led to this error:  Not having the luxury of an active contributor being the proposal author An incomplete checklist for processing ratification poll results The number of threads/comments being posted to the Maker Forum. Expanding internal GovAlpha responsibilities without subsequent increases in the labor pool.  To minimize the chances of a similar event occurring in the future, GovAlpha will be implementing checklists for processing MIPs and investigating automation options for capturing new threads in their MIP tracker. The post closes with a call for feedback: GovAlpha invites anyone with ideas for how this mistake could have been prevented or how to avoid similar mistakes going forward to reach out with their thoughts.  [Jun8 \u201922] Post-Mortem for IRV poll issues As noted in this week\u2019s Weekly Relay, there were issues with voting on the two newly posted priority polls on the Governance Portal. The DUX team investigated and confirmed the root cause of the issue: some users would see their ranked vote options recorded in reverse order. This bug has been resolved, and users have been reimbursed for gas expenses. However, the most efficient fix and testing would take some time, so the DUX team deployed a hotfix to prevent users from voting erroneously on the affected polls. The DUX team has deployed an update to the Governance Portal today, which resolves the issue, and they have taken steps to improve their QA setup to avoid similar problems in the future. Please, visit the original post-mortem thread for more information. Call for interest in becoming a Dai Foundation board member MIP39c2-SP17 commits the Dai Foundation to include two members appointed by MakerDAO on its board. @sorenpeter of the Dai Foundation Core Unit posted inviting community members to register interest in becoming board members. An overview of the general requirements for becoming a board member is available at about the seventeen-minute mark in this video. Reach out to @sorenpeter on Discord, the forums, or via email at [email\u00a0protected] to express interest or ask questions. Updated GovAlpha Administered Multisig In accordance with the guidelines in MIP47: MakerDAO Multisignature Wallet Management, GovAlpha has posted an update on their multisig wallet. The only changes are a transaction adding @Patrick_J as a signer and a transaction removing @LongForWisdom. Additionally, @prose11 is now the point of contact regarding the GovAlpha Multisig. Multi-sig Address: 0x01D26f8c5cC009868A4BF66E268c17B057fF7A73 Keyholders:   @prose11: 0xf3ED2bdeBa77940E6759B806cd55CE20cAE369BE  @Patrick_J: 0x06ADa798f9323392cA30C755383Af879bd853168  Transaction History: Spreadsheet MIP41c5-SP7: Facilitator Offboarding (Voluntary) - LongForWisdom (GOV-001) In their onboarding thread, @LongForWisdom stated that once there were other GovAlpha Facilitators in place, they would re-evaluate their position and either step-down or aim to move into a different role. With \u201cone very capable Governance Facilitator in @prose11 and a proposal up for a vote to onboard Patrick,\u201d @LongForWisdom has decided that it\u2019s time to step down from the Facilitator role. @LongForWisdom plans to continue contributing to MakerDAO and GovAlpha in different capacities and invites anyone \u201cworking on anything with a well-defined end-point\u201d that might be a good fit to get in touch. Chris Blec Delegate Platform Chris Blec published his Delegate platform and a video explaining why he wants to become a Delegate. He has been involved with MakerDAO since early 2019.

Trust minimalist My votes will favor proposals that reduce, not increase, the amount of trust that retail DAI users need to have in Maker Core Units and collateral agents.  Adversarial thinker My votes will favor proposals for economical & technical solutions that are immune to manipulation, exploitation, and/or attack by network participants, state actors, or any other party that may wish to disrupt the continuity of DAI.    Active Discussions Embedding legal analysis on new governance proposals The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Legal Research team has discussed whether MakerDAO should implement a legal review process for new governance proposals. The team points out that a large and valuable organization such as MakerDAO cannot rely on \"makeshift regulatory analysis or hearsay legal opinions\" when it comes to a legal analysis of new proposals. Any new proposal can carry with it significant legal or regulatory consequences. Actions such as issuing new assets that resemble debt or equity or implementing staking rewards could trigger a review or legal enforcement by official regulatory bodies. As of now:  Legal information or analysis is not required or advised for adding new Core Units. Legal information or analysis is not required or advised for adding any changes to the Maker Protocol via MIPs. Onboarding new collateral types include some basic legal requirements in the general Collateral Application Template (MIP6c2) and the RWA Only Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1). This recent amendment introduced some legal questions based on SES Legal Research\u2019s input. Besides collateral onboarding, there are no procedural guarantees or requirements regarding the provision of legally relevant information or legal analysis.  The team outlines a series of goals encompassing the initial steps toward providing legal analysis requirements for proposals to help protect against potential legal and regulatory risks: Short-term Goals  Create the basic means to acquire legally relevant information Correct the \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d negotiation strategy MIP authors are forced into concerning legal topics Dedicate funding to basic legal analysis  Long-term Goals  Improve the quality of decision-making on new proposals by adding legal analysis Reduce decision-making complexity for MKR holders and delegates by synthesizing legal analysis Reduce regulatory and legal risk without stifling innovation Improve the quality of new proposals Formalize and standardize a process of legal auditing  The team\u2019s proposal for achieving some of these goals includes adding a \u201clegal poll\u201d stage after the RFC stage that asks the question: Does this proposal require additional legally relevant information?  Some ways that implementing this proposal or parts of it could help improve MakerDAO include:  MKR holders and the community receive an opportunity to request and obtain legally relevant information. Discussions that include legally relevant information encourage more organized legal discussion and the eventual emergence of further legal tools, analytics, and processes for MakerDAO. MKR holders and the community can verify the legal feasibility of proposals before accepting them, while proponents are provided with a clear procedure and timeframes simultaneously. Proponents can iterate proposals to reduce legal risk to a level acceptable to MKR holders. The process can only be slowed down for selected proposals (those that don\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d the legal poll). MIP authors must anticipate not passing the legal poll, discouraging a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d approach. Improving the quality of new proposals. MIP authors can receive financial support to keep the barrier to entry low. Present the best legal case for the proposal.   [Discussion] Is GFX\u2019s Interest Protocol a Direct Challenge to Maker? GFX Labs plans to launch a new fractional reserve DeFi project called Interest Protocol on June 13. The system is based on an over-collateralized stablecoin called USDi, and the project's whitepaper makes several direct references to the Maker protocol. The cited differences are:  Interest Protocol pays interest to all holders of USDi, while Maker pays interest only through the DSR (when turned on) to DAI staked in the DSR contract Interest Protocol offers cross-margin vaults versus only single-collateral vaults at Maker Interest rates are determined algorithmically at IP but manually via governance at Maker Interest Protocol has a \u201cmore simple and efficient\u201d liquidation mechanism  Based on this information, post author @Matt_NZ asks the community whether the new protocol will be a direct challenger to Maker. Some view Interest Protocol as more of a competitor to Compound:  775\u00d7101 13.7 KB  Delegate Doo Nam weighed in, arguing that any competition would need years to catch up:  787\u00d7126 24.7 KB  Another user shared their thoughts on why Maker should take potential new competitors seriously and view them as an opportunity to better understand the market and what users want and need:  775\u00d7159 26 KB  This is a popular thread with more than 45 comments; share your thoughts here.  Towards web3-native intelligence: tools for protocol comprehension and stewardship @pvl submitted a post on the forum as part of an effort to seek funding and gauge interest in collaboration opportunities for a web3/DeFi-native modeling and decision-making tool. @pvl describes web3 protocols as composed of two mutually impacting parts: on-chain transactions and community interactions. Understanding this \u201cheterogenous living organism\u201d requires being able to model and predict the evolution of these two parts in a unified way. Because both transactions and public sentiment/discussion are freely accessible, DeFi protocols are particularly amenable to this kind of analysis. This modeling and the insight it generates can be used as a tool for native decision-making. In a nutshell, \u201cThe big opportunity here is to design, build, and train a model that intakes community and on-chain data relevant to the protocol/product and outputs respective evolving shared narrative.\u201d  954\u00d7558 42.1 KB  The post provides an outline of implementation details for the first stage of building this system. Primarily, the first stage involves developing a bespoke DeFi-focused annotated community interaction dataset to fine-tune a large language model. Further technical details are available in the post.  Vault Protection Score - Model Validation This post by the Risk Core Unit Team offers a deep dive into the Vault Protection Score metric, which aims to estimate the probability of vault liquidation during major market downturns. The post begins with an overview and discussion of how the Risk team conducts its simulation modeling and the inherent limitations of this analysis method. The post points out that simulation modeling is always beholden to the ultimately subjective assumptions when defining the model. This means we can\u2019t consider any predictions from such models objective or free from bias. The main topic of the post\u2014an analysis of the Vault Protection Score and its accuracy\u2014is conducted via four concrete examples. Chart 1: Liquidated Debt per Risk Score  Chart 2: Debt Exposure per Risk Score  Most debt exposure has historically been assigned a risk score of Low. The ratio of Low-risk exposure to other risk scores has recently decreased due to a decrease in whale exposure (generally considered Low risk) compared to smaller vault owners\u2019 debt exposure. Chart 3: Share of Debt Exposure Liquidated per Risk Score  This chart combines the first two charts into a single metric. High-risk debt exposure shows a much larger probability of liquidating, as intended. The large spike visible in January 2022, during which about 20% of High-risk debt exposure was liquidated, represents Flappy Friday. Chart 4: Flappy Friday Analysis  Looking at the chart for Flappy Friday, we find a clear pattern showing that the safer the assigned risk score is, the more we see a decreasing percentage of the liquidated debt.    Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn @rema submits a signal request replacing the previous Signal by Andrew Burban to restart the burn. This Signal is a trial of the new MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations, which defines the process used to agree and enact permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. It will now be tested for effectiveness through this Signal Request. The Risk Core Unit believes that confronted with a potential crypto winter and global economic recession, it now is crucial for the MakerDAO community to reach a consensus about what to do regarding the surplus buffer. Their solution involves maintaining a sustainable surplus buffer higher than the current level to support risk mitigation and growth while burning a relatively small amount of the surplus buffer to clarify that \u201cburning still is, and will remain, an integral part of MakerDAO and our community.\u201d The vote ends today, June 9th, 2022 Here are the final voting results:  1692\u00d7797 147 KB   Incoming Velodrome Airdrop on Optimism - $VELO veNFT Velodrome is an AMM modeled on Solidly and designed to be a public good that provides deep liquidity and low slippage to token pairs. MakerDAO is eligible to receive an airdrop of veNFT equivalent to 1% of the initial voting power for the new Velodrome protocol launching on Optimism on May 31st.  The veNFT will allow MakerDAO to direct emissions to their chosen liquidity pools, increasing the chosen pairs\u2019 liquidity and receiving all trading fees and bribes for those pools\u2026Strategic Finance believes that Velodrome could be a significant contender for amassing DAI liquidity on Optimism.  The Velodrome team requested to initially manage the veNFT on MakerDAO\u2019s behalf until their DAO is ready to manage it. They proposed both DAI/USDC and DAI/OP pairs for launch to ensure emissions are high enough to attract adequate liquidity. In response, Aes is asking the community the following questions:  Should MakerDAO incentivize the pairs recommended by the Velodrome team? Should MakerDAO transfer veNFT to a Governance-owned multi-sig using MIP47? What should MakerDAO do with the trading fees?  More information on Velodrome can be found on their Medium. The vote ends today, June 9th, 2022 Here are the final voting results:  1692\u00d7682 120 KB   1692\u00d7722 143 KB   1692\u00d7970 195 KB   Update dust limit analysis Recognized Delegate, JustinCase, introduces and defines the dust parameter. Additionally, he illuminates that the last time dust parameters were changed was back in December '21, and gas prices have fallen substantially since then. In preparation for market sentiment returning to normal, JustinCase asks the community whether dust limits should be prioritized again for optimization. Doing this would:  Give us a fresh evaluation and know that risks are adequately accounted for. Allow us to make vaults more accessible.  The vote will run until June 15th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1697\u00d7732 128 KB     Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Click here for a list of current initiatives: Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Links reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.   \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019   The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has released a permissionless token purchasing and a dollar-cost averaging tool called DssKiln in response to the ongoing discussion about using the Surplus Buffer to fund a MakerDAO treasury.   Optimism recently announced a move to a new dual-chamber governance model. @Matt_NZ explored how we can use this model\u2019s focus on better democracy and retroactive funding to improve our governance processes.   A post on DAO intangibles argues that Maker can only foster the proactivity and collaboration any DAO wants among its members by defining a \u201ccommon vision\u201d together with the structure and culture to support it.     First Annual Gala Charity Dinner  6s capital hosts their First Annual Gala Charity Dinner on May 28th in Seville, Spain. Its mission is \u201cto advance the professionalization of onboarding Real-World Assets within the MakerDAO community and raise funds for global medical research.\u201d Fund retrieval exclusion from executive While the Content Production Core Unit has been successfully offboarded, ~3.8K ether is still claimable from the Surplus Buffer by the Content Production Core Unit multi-signature wallet. While recovering these funds as part of a recently passed proposal, the GovAlpha and Protocol Engineering teams decided that it would not be included in any upcoming executive spells due to the complexity of achieving it safely and cost-effectively. Asset Change Request Process The Dai Foundation has released details regarding the process for Asset Registry Content Managers to request changes to an asset (e.g., changing GitHub repository rights or changing the IP target of a subdomain): Head to change.daifoundation.org and fill out the short form.   Governance Reflections: Optimism and Maker Optimism recently announced an update to their governance model. In this forum post, technology lawyer @Matt_NZ shared his thoughts on what we might be able to learn from this update to apply to Maker governance. Optimism will be governed by \"two co-equal chambers\":  The Token House: OP token holders will be able to vote on the distribution of project incentives, which protocol upgrades to develop, and similar proposals. The Citizens\u2019 House: \u201cSoulbound\u201d (non-transferrable) NFT-holding \u201ccitizens\u201d cast votes of equal weight to govern the distribution of retroactive public goods funding.   Maker already has an informal \u201ccitizen\u201d model for some governance processes (e.g., signal votes). This model could potentially be codified with our own MakerDAO soulbound NFTs. This could help promote participation in the Maker system and provide signal voters with something more concrete than a forum profile to demonstrate their involvement with the protocol. Additionally, a similar trial to Optimism\u2019s retroactive funding model could be conducted at Maker, possibly complementing SourceCred distributions.  DssKiln - a permissionless token purchasing tool DssKiln is a token-purchasing and distribution tool for treasuries and other users that want to permissionlessly dollar cost average their token purchases over time. This project was developed as part of the ongoing discussion on using the Surplus Buffer to purchase for and diversify a MakerDAO treasury.  Because DssKiln is permissionless, anyone in the community, including our existing keeper networks, can call the contract to execute buy transactions. Uniswap V3 has been chosen for the ideal initial exchange strategy because it enables slippage protection by preventing front- and back-running sandwich attacks. Future implementations of DssKiln could easily be extended to interact with Curve, Uniswap V2, and other AMMs, each with independent parameters, similar to how Direct Deposit Dai Modules (D3Ms) can support different ecosystems and markets depending on liquidity and business requirements. An alternative strategy is provided that demonstrates a \u201cbuy and burn\u201d model that can exist outside the core protocol.   MakerDAO - intangibles for a better DAO In this early stage of their development, much of the attention surrounding DAOs have been on the technological and software side. @Mamun argues that \"the messy nature of human interaction within DAOs\" has not been addressed sufficiently. In a traditional organization, an organization\u2019s brand and core values are defined from the top down. In DAOs, on the other hand, participants within independent structures such as Core Units may not always have a strong idea of the unified purpose and general overall goals of the DAO, which can lead to misalignment between contributors and Core Units. Since Core Units often need to work together and collaborate on tasks, this can create issues. The post goes on to argue that while proactivity and collaboration are two of the most important qualities to seek out in a DAO contributor, without a \u201ccommon vision\u201d and the structure and culture to support it, we will not be able to grow and progress at the rate we would like to no matter how many productive members we have, even if they collaborate well. In short, the post argues that Maker suffers from a lack of mission and vision, visible in the relative independence of Core Units and what some see as their focus on operating according to their mandate, which \u201cdoes get in the way of collaboration.\u201d Knowing where we are headed and defining relationships between Core Units can foster a more collaborative and coherent inter-CU working environment. The current state of CUs  An operational map focused on promoting collaboration and proactivity structure   Macro - Rising bond yields and DAI @Metternich made a post asking for clarification on how rate hikes and rising yields on the treasury market could impact Dai. The 10-year bond yield has risen from 1.5% in December 2021 to close to 3% today. This might be expected to put pressure on the liquidity of the entire stablecoin market. @Metternich wants to know why this pressure has not led to more variable DAI/USD price action. @Jiecut quickly jumped in with the answer. In short, Dai is less affected by shifting stablecoin liquidity because it is partially pegged to the dollar via the Peg Stability Module (PSM). If the PSM begins to be significantly depleted, the Dai Savings Rate and other rates would need to be raised to continue successfully protecting the peg from downward pressure.  1098\u00d7631 46.3 KB  Celebrating 1 year of RWAs in Maker Real world assets are a hot topic in the Maker community right now. They are considered an important factor in the ongoing quest to develop a promising aggressive growth plan. Forum user @spin recently reminded us to celebrate that just over a year ago, on April 21st, 2021, New Silver minted 380k Dai backed by real-world collateral, marking the first time such a transaction ever took place on a decentralized lending protocol!   \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Restart The Burn @aburban90 presents his request in favor of reactivating the MKR burn. He states that shutting down the burn also shut down our only revenue distribution model and that we have yet to replace it with anything better. These actions have caused some OG stakeholders to lose faith in our ability to deliver. Our community and stakeholders are very important, and there is a possibility we may be risking their confidence in us if we continue not to burn MKR during times of such low prices. In conclusion, Andrew asks the community whether we want to restart the burn with a reduced lid parameter to mitigate many of the inefficiencies.

Sebastian from Strategic Finance moves forward on the Balance Sheet Approach toward an Aggressive Growth Strategy by gauging community sentiment on whether we would like to begin working on allocating some of the MakerDAO balance sheets into ETH and/or ETH derivatives. He presents the pros and cons of potentially implementing this investment into ETH: Pros:  MakerDAO is using Ethereum as its home base and is therefore linked to the success of ETH. ETH is a strategic asset for the operations of the DAO because it pays gas fees for on-chain transactions and oracles. Competitors like Celo, TribeDAO, and Angle are holding ETH on their balance sheet, and not holding ETH puts Maker at a distinct competitive disadvantage. The upcoming Merge will significantly reduce the issuance of new ETH and create a competitive market for balance sheets with a high degree of exposure to ETH. Post-Merge staking fees are currently estimated at 7-11%, doubling current staking yields overnight and making ETH a truly productive asset.  Cons:  ETH is a volatile asset whose ETH/DAI price can wildly fluctuate and occasionally go down over significant periods The Merge and L2 impacts can have unexpected long-term impacts on price.  Sebastian also notes that this Signal Request aims to understand whether there is a community desire to work on this topic. No priority is currently being attributed, and a formal implementation for such actions will have to go through the governance processes. The vote will run until May 12th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1702\u00d7907 190 KB   Change lid Parameter on the Rate Limiter The passing and introduction of the Rate Limiting Flapper have been successful. However, it only allows to kick off a new auction if it does not increase the total-DAI-currently-in-auction above a certain threshold - the lid unless it is at the same value as the bump. Currently, the value for the lid is set to 150k Dai, which can run five flap auctions at once. However, ultraschuppi believes there is no good reason to burn so much MKR and proposes setting the lid to the same value as bump - 30,000 Dai. Having a 1:1 \u2018lid\u2019 to \u2018bump\u2019 ratio will ensure that there is only one parallel flap auction running at any given time. What is good about this is that in the case of a huge spike on the System Surplus causing spillage to the Surplus Buffer, the time spread of those resulting auctions will be 5x compared to the current setting thereby producing a more steady burn. However, we will limit the maximum MKR burnt per day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai in sacrifice. Vote will run until May 13, 2022.

As part of a series of exploratory surveys with different MakerDAO stakeholder groups, surveys will be sent out to Recognized Delegates and Core Facilitators in the near future.  Deimos Delegation Platform  Deimos published their Delegate platform with the primary goal of pushing through the Endgame Plan and ensuring a good transitional phase. @Deimos believes that MKR holders\u2019 opinions are not being heard and plans to work to change that. Background  MKR holder since 2017 eight years in entrepreneurship three years as an operations director  Key Info Name: Deimos Nickname: The endgame plan delegate Forum: @Deimos Delegate Address: 0x94070ad138abdd3742166e75b4d4e645b5d8b11e  Avoiding the Tragedy: ACREinvest Delegate Office Hours  Kianga Daverington, founder of Recognized Delegate ACREinvest, held open office hours on Monday in the form of an AMA. ACREinvest aims to leverage the positive qualities of the crypto space\u2014decentralization, transparency, consensus, cooperation, liberty, and privacy\u2014to help create a better world for everyone.   Active Discussions  Endgame Plan 4: Understanding MetaDAOs  The fourth post in @rune\u2019s series on the Endgame Plan covers a critical topic: MetaDAOs.  MetaDAOs come in three different primary forms:   CreatorDAOs: General MetaDAOs with a very flexible and autonomous scope  GovernorDAOs: Focus on running core governance processes and bureaucratic systems as a service for Maker  ReformerDAOs: Handle everything related to the real world, such as Real World Assets and legal and political outreach  MetaDAOs have multiple avenues available for generating revenue streams:  MetaDAOs also provide a foundation for one of the secondary goals of the Endgame Plan: helping Maker expand to layer-2 blockchains. New MetaDAOs will have an opportunity to stake out exclusive claims to L2s that have not yet been adopted by Maker, opening up further revenue possibilities while helping MakerDAO expand cross-chain.  @rune also hopes MetaDAOs will get involved in the Metaverse, an area where the Maker organization has yet to find a natural entrance. The goal is to foster ways for MetaDAOs to create intangible value, such as achieving higher community activation by running private gaming servers for members, getting involved in NFT curation, or hosting real-world events.  The post concludes with a look at six different MetaDAOs that could help rein in governance complexity and provide tangible benefits for MakerDAO.      DeCap + Quadratic Funding: augmenting the EndGame. Optimal infrastructure funding mechanism for MakerDAO  \u201cMakerDAO is facing the problem of optimal allocation of limited resources towards public goods.\u201d @pvl made a post outlining what they believe is the optimal way to finance MakerDAO infrastructure. One popular solution for managing resource distribution for the funding of public goods is quadratic funding, supported by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and others, which enables voters to signal support for a proposed public good as well as the strength of that support, which can be purchased at an increasing marginal cost. A matching pool (budget) then matches voting results with funds. @pvl introduces the idea of DeCaps (Decentralised/Delegate/Degen Capital) to apply this concept to MakerDAO. A DeCap is defined by:  Delegated MKR Reputation earned from objective data (degree of active involvement in the DAO activities: onchain vote participation, successful MIP authorship, etc.) Subjective peer assessment (delegates/community members/MKR holders give subjective scores)  Each Delegate has their own cumulative, non-transferable, individual DeCap that they vote with and is compensated proportionally to. Using DeCaps, decisions about fund allocation can be made using the quadratic voting mechanism. Under the proposed system, a Global Allocated Budget is designated for a period of time, say three months. Anyone can nominate funding recipients and provide arguments for their nominations. With an individual amount of credits in proportion to their DeCap at the start of the voting period, Delegates allocate their credits based on their assessments of a proposed funding recipient or project\u2019s value. Delegates can also indicate the strength of their opinions by allocating multiple credits to the same recipient at an increasing marginal cost per allocation, thereby implementing the quadratic voting mechanism. The various metrics and variables can be tailored specifically to Maker\u2019s needs.  The Endgame Party delegate signup  As Rune continues to host the Open Decentralized Voter Committee calls, he recently introduced the Endgame Plan itself will have multiple stages of voting, including a preliminary Signal Request and the Endgame Plan Launch MIP. Additionally, Rune states that it will be beneficial and stabilizing to get a general understanding of the level of support for the Endgame Plan. As a result, Rune posted a thread where delegates can sign up to help run the Endgame Party. However, committed delegates are expected to attend as many Endgame Party Decentralized Voter Committees as possible, vote according to its direction, and contribute with information, ideas and proposals. Currently, the following recognized delegates have signed up and committed to the Endgame Plan:     Recognized Delegate Platform Signup Post     Doo Nam Platform Signup   JustinCase Platform Signup   3F Delegate LLC Platform Signup   Flipside Crypto Platform Signup   Penn Blockchain Platform Signup   Feedblack Loops LLC Platform Signup    Other recognized delegates, such as ChrisBlec, Mhonkasalo & teemulau, and MakerMan, have decided to support the Endgame vision while remaining independent to maintain their platform values and promote decentralized delegation. Furthermore, SebVentures has posted his own Delegate signup platform for a plan that is more business-oriented. His vision is simple: improving balance sheet allocation by investing in liquid tokens, lending against them, and promoting market making.  [KICKOFF] Governance from First Principles: Building a Resilient, Decentralized, and Uncensorable Stablecoin  Independent of the endgame plan or variants thereof, a group of contributors (mentioned in the thread) are hosting a call on June 30th at 17:00 UTC to gather an informal group of colleagues who will share their views around governance and help propose alternatives for reform to strengthen MakerDAO and DAI. This call aims to kick-start a process to give them shape and turn them into actionable items for governance to enact. The thread also offers a number of selected articles which will be referenced for discussion: https://forum.makerdao.com/t/hasu-delegate-platform/13892?u=adcv https://forum.makerdao.com/t/specialization-unlocks-complexity/15709 https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-business-oriented-scientific-governance-delegate-signup/15838?u=adcv https://forum.makerdao.com/t/against-the-burn/13412 https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a16z-makerdao-tokenomics-proposal-three-increasing-financial-resiliency-and-fostering-growth/14138 https://forum.makerdao.com/t/aggressive-growth-strategy/13958 https://forum.makerdao.com/t/a-balance-sheet-approach-to-executing-an-aggressive-growth-strategy-the-road-to-300m-revenues/14818 https://forum.makerdao.com/t/makerdao-long-term-growth-strategy-for-the-future-of-defi/15457  Call details:  Zoom Link June 30th at 17:00 UTC   GovAlpha Internal Process Changes  In light of recent governance-related errors, GovAlpha is making a series of updates to its workflow:  GovAlpha will continue to allow Signal Requests as trials of yet-to-be approved MIPs. They believe this is a valuable tool for MIP authors and Governance when assessing MIPs that can identify edge cases. However, GovAlpha will no longer allow trials due to Signal Requests and top-level MIPs to be polled simultaneously. This may delay the ratification of top-level MIPs until the following month\u2019s governance cycle, in communication with the proposal\u2019s author(s). Under every post that will lead to an on-chain governance action (Signal Request/MIP/PPG proposal/Facilitator proposal, etc.), GovAlpha will post a summary of their interpretation of its effects (example here). As per their mandate, this will remain neutral where necessary but will explain steps relating to the Governance process. GovAlpha will dedicate resources to developing an automated opt-in notification system for posts/proposals that are given High and Medium impact tags on the forum. GovAlpha has already reached out to Recognized Delegates regarding this, but any solution(s) will be available to the community.   BFF Partnership with GnosisDAO  @Karpatkey made a post outlining a proposed partnership between MakerDAO and GnosisDAO. The proposal has already been approved by GnosisDAO. Gnosis Chain uses bridged DAI as its gas token, so aligning incentives may make sense. GnosisDAO proposes:  A GNO-MKR token swap of around $70 million to the Maker community Exploring the use of an institutional MakerDAO vault with the GnosisDAO treasury using GNO + stETH to mint 100 million DAI for the development of the Gnosis Chain Exploring a GNO grant with the Growth Core Unit to expand global adoption and brand awareness of Gnosis Chain Rebranding xDAI to DAI Increasing GNO incentives to DAI pairs on Gnosis Chain Periodically buying MKR on the open market using GnosisDAO\u2019s treasury farming rewards  Further details regarding each of these proposals are available in the full post.  Modeling DAI maturity  @SebVentures of the Strategic Finance Core Unit made a post modeling DAI maturity. A bank deposit is the closest traditional financial instrument to a stablecoin like DAI. TradFi methods of modeling bank deposits, however, are difficult to apply to on-chain assets. Ideally, we would be able to model customer behavior using on-chain behavioral data informed by macroeconomic factors such as bull/bear markets, interest rates, etc. Still, this model would be very expensive and unreliable to generate at the current stage. @SubVentures settled on a simpler model: Create buckets of on-chain addresses, then generate a worst outflow scenario based on historical data. By splitting addresses that hold DAI into \u201corganic\u201d\u2014all Externally Owned Addresses\u2014and \u201cspeculative\u201d\u2014all smart contracts and the DSR\u2014buckets and calculating max drawdowns over different periods, we get:  We can use the same approach to analyze historical data:   What can we take away from these models?  50% of outstanding DAI is on \u201clong\u201d maturity (more than three months) The short-term front of DAI maturity is quite volatile, with more than 20% DAI with maturity below one day and up to 40% over one week  In conclusion, the post suggests, \u201cWe need to keep at least 50% of outstanding DAI in medium-term maturity assets (unwindable within 1-year), 40% unwindable within a week, and 20% unwindable within a day.\u201d  [Informal Poll] Direct End Game Party Delegate Compensation To Rune\u2019s Wallet  @Ippy submitted an informal poll gauging support for directing Endgame Party Delegate compensation to @rune\u2019s wallet, as he is \u201cdoing all of the decision-making work.\u201d Commenters questioned if the poll was serious, but @Ippy maintained that it was.   Seeking Consensus \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019  [Signal Request] Weather-Proofing Existing RWA Vaults Against Market Conditions  This Signal Request is for gauging community sentiment around the idea of programmatically adjusting the existing RWA vault structure and updating the reporting system to help defend against the effects of adverse market conditions. On the \u201cre-pricing\u201d side, this SR proposes updating Vault stability fees to align them more with current macroeconomic conditions. Regarding risk monitoring, RWF would like to require from operators:  An in-depth monthly surveillance/remittance report on an asset-by-asset and portfolio basis A corporate solvency/liquidity report Immediate notification regarding any changes to the creditworthiness of any end-borrowers  This Signal Request will run until Thursday, June 23rd at 8:30 pm UTC. Current vote breakdown:  1695\u00d71075 198 KB   Signal Request: Asset Allocation of MIP65/Clydesdale  This Signal Request seeks input on allocating 500M DAI between strategies and asset managers/assets. Publishing this Signal Request is a requirement of MIP65. The allocation options provided are:  This Signal Request will run until Monday, June 27th at 9 am UTC. Current vote breakdown:  1712\u00d71320 270 KB   [Signal Request] REPEAL Poll ID-827 Deployment of a Permissionless Open Market Operation Trial  @flipflopflapdelegate submitted a Signal Request to enable Level 2 Community Members to repeal Poll ID 827, which sought to use the DssKiln module to re-purchase MKR on the open market. While the proposal passed, @flipflopflapdelegate and others found several issues with it, including:  Some MKR holders believe the Signal Request and on-chain vote were rushed, and MIP74 has yet to be enacted. When this Signal Request was made, the Maker Community was not adequately informed that it could be exposed to counterparty risk (Celsius, Nexo, etc.).  Shadow Delegate 0x749 was not able to vote, as they were in the middle of setting up their Delegate Platform and re-delegating their MKR.  Recognized Delegate @Hasu was on vacation, as @GovAlpha-Core-Unit and @Recognized-Delegates have yet to design an alternative plan for taking time off from Delegate Voting. Some MKR holders prefer a burn at a much lower daily capacity and duration  This Signal Request will run until Monday, June 27th at 9 am UTC. Current vote breakdown:  1702\u00d7690 133 KB   Signal Request: LP our AAVE and ENS with ETH on Uniswap v3  In response to MakerDAO\u2019s receipt of a large quantity of ENS tokens after last year\u2019s ENS airdrop, this Signal Request gauges community sentiment about LPing Maker\u2019s AAVE and ENS in the treasury with ETH. Selling airdrops may reflect poorly on MakerDAO; putting them to work in liquidity pools may enable Maker to generate additional revenue from the ENS airdrop without jeopardizing community sentiment or rendering MakerDAO ineligible for future airdrops. About $90k in stkAAVE tokens are also currently unutilized. This Signal Request will run until June 30th, 2022. Current vote breakdown:  1700\u00d7732 161 KB   1700\u00d7732 168 KB    Ongoing Initiatives \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.

Links reflect our views of the most noteworthy activities in the governance, risk, and oracles categories. Disagree? Think something should be added? Leave a reply or send a PM.   \u2018What is the most relevant information on the forums this week for MKR and Dai holders?\u2019  Maker co-founder @rune posted the first two parts of an upcoming comprehensive document explaining his Endgame Plan for improving and solidifying Maker governance. SES shared an overview of their work with Dr. Julian Frede assessing critical environmental, social, and governance risks and opportunities for Maker. A very popular discussion post invites forum members to share their opinion on the capital raise proposed by the RWA and Growth Core Units to fund further protocol development and DAI market expansion    No Executive Proposal - 2022-06-01 GovAlpha announces their decision with Protocol Engineering to skip the upcoming Executive Vote of July 1st, 2022. This is due to a lack of proposals or items requiring inclusion in the next Executive Vote. GovAlpha will still post weekly polls next week, with a number expected to go live on Monday, May 30th. July 8th, 2022, will continue with the regular Executive Vote cadence.  Mhonkasalo & teemulau Delegate Platform Meet Your Delegate #13 - mhonkasalo & teemulau and ChicagoDAO mhonkasalo & teemulau, long-time crypto investors who have been involved in the DeFi world for several years, have published their delegate platform. @mhonkasalo runs a popular Twitter account and has been a member of the research team at The Block and the investment team at ParaFi Capital. @teemulau has experience organizing Slush, a large global tech event, and experience working in finance and operations positions at startups. mhonkasalo & teemulau have two primary values and initiatives. Helping MakerDAO craft a growth strategy mhonkasalo & teemulau believe DAI will become increasingly B2B, creating an opportunity for MakerDAO to become a wholesale DAO-to-DAO lender for any DeFi protocol that distributes DAI. Supporting a scalable DAO model In particular, mhonkasalo & teemulau aim to help address the following concerns:  Maker governance needs more active delegates with enough weight to impact the overall results and drive new initiatives that don\u2019t necessarily originate from Maker core team members. Core Units aren\u2019t always aligned with the interests of MKR holders. Establishing trust between MKR holders and Core Units is key going forward. Maker is currently unprofitable. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that resources should be cut, but now is a good opportunity for further analysis to ensure that goals to help Maker scale are being prioritized correctly.  You can learn more about mhonkasalo & teemulau and ChicagoDAO at Meet Your Delegate #13, which will be taking place on June 8 at 5:30 pm UTC. Google Calendar Event Zoom Meeting Link Meeting ID: 852 6891 7264 Passcode: 312807  Amended MIP40: Important Information for Core Units In the latest development in the ongoing discussion about Core Unit budgeting, MIP40 defines a framework for managing and modifying Core Unit budgets and has been amended with several substantial changes. Some primary changes include:   Budget Submission Windows: Budget Submission Windows is a new aspect of Core Unit budgets outlined by MIP40. Budget requests can only be submitted quarterly in March, June, September, and November.  Budget Start and End Dates: Budgets now have a maximum duration of 12 months and cannot start later than three months after being formally submitted.  Budget Composition: Budget requests are now required to provide more specific details  For a more in-depth overview, check out Monday\u2019s Weekly Relay.   The Endgame Plan parts 1&2 MakerDAO co-founder @rune posted a comprehensive overview of his Endgame Plan, a heavily discussed topic on the forums since it was introduced two weeks ago. This post contains the first two sections of a full document to be released in the future. The Endgame Plan is an initiative for completely revamping Maker governance to eventually establish a \"predetermined, immutable end state\" that is truly decentralized. Some of the shorter-term goals of the Endgame Plan include:  Quickly launching a synthetic ETH product that allows Maker to tap into the Ethereum Merge Incubating a fully-fledged, economically sustainable DAO with significant synergy with Maker  Yield farming the new DAO token to DAI and allowing ETH vault and MKR holders to participate in governance The farming rewards mean this will immediately drive governance participation and help address voter apathy and centralization of governance   Establishing stronger norms and codes of conduct for governance participants, creating a check on the power of Delegates and Core Units  Read About Part 1 Part 1 of the post includes a discussion and explanation of a large array of topics, including: MetaDAOs, the primary tool of the Endgame Plan MetaDAOs will establish dynamics that fit better into a decentralized and transparent ecosystem. They will also allow Maker to measure the value and potential in the ecosystem and the workforce by wrapping tokens around them, then boosting that potential value by seeding a community through the distribution of the tokens.     Read About Part 2 Part 2 of the post, \u201cEndgame Plan Launch,\u201d goes into some specifics surrounding details on how MetaDAOs will work in practice and how the launch will be conducted.   The post concludes by outlining the benefits of implementing the Endgame Plan for Maker stakeholders and Maker governance and growth:       Should Maker Manage Sustainability? What Topics Will Be Most Relevant to Future-Proof the DAO The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit (SES) partnered with sustainability and impact management expert Dr. Julian Frede to assess key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities for Maker. SES and Dr. Frede produced a report exploring their findings. The team settled on two key questions regarding MakerDAO's relationship to sustainability, which they define in this post as \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\":  Dr. Frede shared his findings in an interview with members of SES.      The report summarizes approaches to answering a series of important questions, including:   Mapping topics on Maker: Where are the risks and opportunities in the sector? Identifying categories of sustainability topics related to Maker:   CO2 footprint: Managing the major KPI on climate change  Cyber ecosystem risks and developments: Keeping the combination of first-mover and best practices; digital trust is a key element of this category  Financial inclusion: Understanding and promoting the benefits of the Maker customer base to create an inclusive platform for economic empowerment for everyone  Talent & people: Remaining the employer of choice  Regulation: Understanding the reasons for regulation and engaging with governments and regulators  Strategy and processes: Using scientific governance and data-driven management to identify and manage key sustainability topics  Community: Fostering Maker\u2019s engagement with the global community    Dr. Frede also included in his report a sketch of potential next steps on Maker\u2019s road to sustainability:   MakerDAO: Long-term Growth Strategy for the Future of DeFi Several contributors published a forum post outlining their views, continuing the ongoing discussion regarding Maker's overall growth strategy. The authors believe that Maker\u2019s core is the asset base of the protocol. Today, however, this base is not being used to its full potential. It needs to be \u201cinvested conservatively but managed productively.\u201d  To grow the surplus buffer to a level where it is capable of absorbing risk when Maker needs it to, the post proposes three \u201cpillars of growth\u201d:  Becoming the first programmatic lender in the emerging DeFi money markets through D3Ms and institutional vaults Becoming the stablecoin of reference for retail users in a multi-chain universe through MCD on Layer 2s/multi-chain and an in-house Maker Teleport system that connects the ecosystem with DAI as the base currency Establishing real-world organic demand, laying the decentralized financial rails that connect crypto and the real world  Building these pillars will require us to:  Invest our assets productively, in accordance with prudent liquidity management Scale our surplus buffer quickly and programmatically, in line with new growth Become the wholesale lender of choice for crypto and the real world alike  Further Details The full post goes into detail regarding ways to achieve these goals, including:         [Discussion] Capital Raise In this post, @Tosh9.0 asks: \"Are you for or against the token offering/capital raise pushed by RWA and Growth to fund further protocol development and Dai market expansion?\" This thread was forked from a Signal Request post regarding a trial run MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations, which defines the process used to agree on and enact permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. Since being posted three days ago, this discussion post has attracted more than 60 comments. @luca_pro, a supporter of the capital raise, made several points clarifying their position:  705\u00d7207 49.8 KB  Maker co-founder @rune dropped in to voice his concerns:  696\u00d780 16.8 KB  Discussion is ongoing and focused; contribute your thoughts if this topic interests you. [Informal Poll] Require 2/3 approval to issue MKR or debt In the interest of encouraging Maker contributors seeking to raise money to address issues raised by critics, this poll asks:  That any vote authorizing the sale of MKR requires a 2/3 majority to pass That any vote authorizing the sale of debt, debt-like tokens, or any form of \u201cgiving yield\u201d requires a 2/3 majority to pass MKR vesting, flap auctions, DSR, Deco CU, and any other programs already authorized today are excluded from this requirement If passed, the effect expires after six months  Pros  Ensures money is only raised if a substantial percentage of the community is willing to commit to and accept the costs, which also lowers the chances of reneging on obligations Still allows for raising money if needed  Cons  Makes it harder to raise money for the next six months     \u2018Yo, do you even signal?\u2019 Deploy a Trial Permissionless Open Market Operation & Resurrect the Burn @rema submits a signal request replacing the previous Signal by Andrew Burban to restart the burn. This Signal is a trial of the new MIP74: Permissionless Open Market Operations, which defines the process used to agree and enact permissionless open market operations with funds controlled by MakerDAO. It will now be tested for effectiveness through this Signal Request. The Risk Core Unit believes that confronted with a potential crypto winter and global economic recession, it now is crucial for the MakerDAO community to reach a consensus about what to do regarding the surplus buffer. Their solution involves maintaining a sustainable surplus buffer higher than the current level to support risk mitigation and growth while burning a relatively small amount of the surplus buffer to clarify that \u201cburning still is, and will remain, an integral part of MakerDAO and our community.\u201d The vote will run until June 9th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1687\u00d7802 148 KB   Incoming Velodrome Airdrop on Optimism - $VELO veNFT Velodrome is an AMM modeled on Solidly and designed to be a public good that provides deep liquidity and low slippage to token pairs. MakerDAO is eligible to receive an airdrop of veNFT equivalent to 1% of the initial voting power for the new Velodrome protocol launching on Optimism on May 31st.  The veNFT will allow MakerDAO to direct emissions to the liquidity pools of their choosing, increasing the liquidity of the chosen pairs and receiving all trading fees and bribes for those pools\u2026Strategic Finance believes that Velodrome could be a significant contender for amassing DAI liquidity on Optimism.  The Velodrome team requested to initially manage the veNFT on MakerDAO\u2019s behalf until their DAO is ready to manage it. They proposed both DAI/USDC and DAI/OP pairs for launch to ensure emissions are high enough to attract adequate liquidity. In response, Aes is asking the community the following questions:  Should MakerDAO incentivize the pairs recommended by the Velodrome team? Should MakerDAO transfer veNFT to a Governance-owned multi-sig using MIP47? What should MakerDAO do with the trading fees?  More information on Velodrome can be found on their Medium. The vote will run until June 9th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1692\u00d7687 101 KB   1692\u00d7725 128 KB   1692\u00d7972 203 KB   Request Minting of new MKR Tokens to Replace MKR Tokens Inadvertently Sent to MKR Token Address (Burned) wingstick_99942 inadvertently sent 3.1994 MKR to the MKR Governance Address and submitted a follow-up Signal Request in hopes of successfully requesting an exact number of new MKR tokens to be minted and returned to the sender\u2019s address since the existing tokens are inaccessible. The vote will run until June 8th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1697\u00d7705 131 KB   Update dust limit analysis Recognized Delegate, JustinCase, introduces and defines the dust parameter. Additionally, he illuminates that the last time dust parameters were changed was back in December '21, and gas prices have fallen substantially since then. In preparation for market sentiment returning to normal, JustinCase asks the community whether dust limits should be prioritized again for optimization. Doing this would:  Give us a fresh evaluation and know that risks are adequately accounted for. Allow us to make vaults more accessible.  The vote will run until June 15th, 2022 Here are the current voting results:  1695\u00d7707 111 KB     \u2018Oh my god, this is taking ages; why can\u2019t things be simple?\u2019 Click here for a list of current initiatives: Maker Operational Manual - @GovAlpha-Core-Unit release the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invite all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation to add for the Manual.
