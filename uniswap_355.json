Even if UNI governance was able to reduce or remove team/investor allocations, should we? In my opinion, definitely not. Uniswap team and investors were committing time and money to the project before it became successful, and deserve to benefit from this success they helped build. I feel like my views on this pretty much align with this tweet thread:   twitter.com    \ud83c\udccf (Fiskantes)  2/6 If you dont like what $UNI did, fork it I guess?   Oh wait, that already happened. Like 862 times. Plenty of choices, no need to bitch right?  Just dump your free UNI and use your fav \"fai launch\" clone. Its fair game. Nobody forces you to partake in gOvERnANcE either. https://t.co/FxgsK7YjXN  2:51 AM - 19 Sep 2020     30            ",
