I would like to gather sentiment on whether governance prefers a date threshold, a supply threshold, a peg threshold, a combination of the three, or something completely different. If we can come to some sort of consensus on what type of threshold makes sense, we can begin to get granular about the actual threshold parameters. In summary: I will create a poll to determine where consensus lies on global shutdown parameters. If a clear signal emerges I will create a second poll in order to clarify threshold details in the hope of getting us on the right page towards the inevitable shutdown of our legacy system.     Shutdown vote begins on a specific date Shutdown vote begins once a certain supply has been reached Shutdown vote begins once the peg has increased/decreased a certain % Other - Please explain below No Opinion / Show me results     0 voters     This is a multiple choice poll, vote for  everything  you are willing to vote for in an on-chain vote.

This might mean supporting SAI until the peg breaks severely (1 SAI > 1.05 DAI). I do not suspect SAI would trade below DAI because you can migrate it 1:1 in that direction. By far, the largest remaining Sai holder is Compound Sai. Compound doesn\u2019t seem to have an easy way to migrate debt between the two contracts, so all outstanding loans (totaling $2.8m SAI) would have to be repaid, and every creditor would have to withdraw and migrate. This may not be possible for every borrower or creditor, and global shutdown could prevent repayment, resulting in the inevitable seizure of collateral (if that would even work after shutdown) or perhaps the failure of the entire system.
