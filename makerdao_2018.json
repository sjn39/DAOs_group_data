                    "content": " MIP10: Oracle Management  Preamble MIP#: 10 Title: Oracle Management  Author(s): Niklas Kunkel (@NiklasKunkel), Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL), Rune Christensen (@Rune23) Type: Process Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a   Summary This proposal defines the process for onboarding, offboarding and managing oracles.  Motivation In the Maker Protocol, every collateral type has a corresponding Oracle that publishes a reference price that the protocol utilizes. Therefore, the Oracle requirements must be laid out in detail for the collateral onboarding process. Governance may also choose to create Oracles for non-collateral assets for use by 3rd parties.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP10 Components   MIP10c1: Oracle Onboarding  MIP10c2: List of Active Oracle Data Models  MIP10c3: Process for onboarding  MIP10c4: Process for offboarding    MIP10c1: Oracle Onboarding The Oracle Onboarding process is as follows:  Oracle Team(s) find and select data sources  Exchange options Pair selection   The Oracle Team(s) select an appropriate Data Model (a model detailing how the data is processed to get the desired output) based on the specific asset type and what data is available. The Oracle Team(s) complete the following technical deliverables:  Update price querying tool(s) to pull from the selected data sources and implement the Data Model for that specific asset Update the Oracle client(s) to integrate the latest version of the price querying tool(s) and incorporate technical changes   Deploy new instances of previously audited smart contracts for the asset type. This includes two smart contracts:  Medianizer Oracle Security Module (OSM)   Notify the Feeds to update their Oracle clients  Alert sent out on the official Keybase channel Timeline: 1 to 2 weeks to monitor deployment and confirm stability   The Oracle Team publishes the Medianizer and OSM smart contract addresses in the onboarding proposal (MIP10c3) itself.    MIP10c2: List of Active Oracle Data Models Oracle Data Model Template Explanation:   Source: The data source for the Oracle Feed  Asset Pair: The asset pair is a price quote of the exchange rate for two different assets traded on the market.  Quorum: The number of Feeds you need to reach a consensus on a price.  Feed Model:  Model for how a Feed processes all sourced data into a singular price  Oracle Model: Model for how an Oracle processes all Feed data into a singular price  Example Template:      Source Asset Pair Quorum Feed Model Oracle Model     < data source > < param > < # > < mode > < model >    Active Oracle Data Models: ETH/USD Data Model |    Source     |  Asset Pair   |Quorum | Feed Model  | Oracle Model | | :------------ | :------------ | :---: | :---------: | :----------: | |   Binance     |    ETH/BTC    |   13  |    Median   |    Median    | |   BitFinex    |    ETH/USDT   | |   Bitstamp    |    ETH/USD    | |   Coinbase    |    ETH/USD    | |   Gemini      |    ETH/USD    | |   Kraken      |    ETH/USD    |  BAT/USD Data Model |    Source     |  Asset Pair   | Quorum | Feed Model  | Oracle Model | | :------------ | :------------ | :----: | :---------: | :----------: | |   Binance     |    BAT/BTC    |   13   |    Median   |    Median    | |   Bittrex     |    BAT/BTC    | |   Coinbase    |    BAT/USDC   | |   Upbit       |    BAT/KRW    |  USDC/USD Data Model |    Source     |  Asset Pair   | Quorum | Feed Model  | Oracle Model | | :------------ | :-----------: | :----: | :---------: | :----------: | |      1        |      N/A      |   N/A  |     N/A     |      N/A     |    MIP10c3: Process for Onboarding This process MIP component is used by the Oracle Team(s) to onboard new oracles for collateral assets as well as compel the Feeds to update their Data Models in preparation for deploying a new Oracle.   Feedback Period: 0 days  Frozen period: 0 days  Update Interval: Feeds have a period of 2 weeks during which to upgrade their systems to include the Oracle type and data models. Any Feeds not upgraded during this interval are presumed to be in breach of their responsibilities and potentially subject to removal.

Keepers take advantage of the economic incentives presented by the Protocol; Oracles and Global Settlers are external actors with special permissions in the system assigned to them by MKR voters; and Maker community members are individuals and organizations that provide services. DAO Teams Emergency Oracle Keepers DAO Team Risk and Mitigation Responsibilities of Governance  And then here :  Dissolution of The Maker Foundation The Maker Foundation currently plays a role, along with independent actors, in maintaining the Maker Protocol and expanding its usage worldwide, while facilitating Governance. However, the Maker Foundation plans to dissolve once MakerDAO can manage Governance completely on its own. Should MakerDAO fail to sufficiently take the reins upon the Maker Foundation\u2019s dissolution, the future health of the Maker Protocol could be at risk. I think there is a lot to clarify to the new proposal. But can you answer to my question if anyone can come up with a proposal, open a pool and implement the proposal if this pass the vote and become a independent Oracle Team or Advisor ??? Thanks for your answer. ",
