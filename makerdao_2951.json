Hopefully we\u2019ll get a rich discussion and an explanation where Sam can give us a bit of an overview of MIP29, which is the Peg Stabilization Module. If anyone feels like interrupting or asking any questions, feel free to do so. Discussions about MIPs happen in the Forum.   MIP29: Peg Stabilization Module  MIP29: MIP29 - Peg Stability Module MIP29 with Sam MacPherson (00:50)  Discussion  02:54 - Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a user and the PSM is implemented. Does this mean that through an interface I can just go and trade a stablecoin, potentially USDC, against Dai 1 to 1? 05:00 - Is there a percentage or is it a fixed amount of Dai that you are going to pay? 05:11 - Do we have any idea about potential percentages for implementation or is that something to be decided later by Risk or potentially the MKR holders? 06:05 - Regarding one of the risks that I\u2019ve been reading about: potentially having a debt ceiling for these vaults where there\u2019s a maximum amount of Dai that can be minted with this system. How does that work? 06:46 - Would this also work in the opposite case? Let\u2019s say the PSM is empty and Dai is trading at 0.99 instead of 1.01. Would this work or would we need to use other resources? 07:45 - Lucasmanuel: I just want to say that it\u2019s a good thing that you\u2019re using the existing ilk format for this. It\u2019s going to be much easier to audit [followed by an explanation as to what the ilk format is] 08:49 - Sam, do you want to cover a little bit more the opposing views or the risks? 10:03 - Is it possible that this will be used instead of a backstop as a frontstop so that all the pools that are made right now from stablecoins will be emptied\u2026? Is it more profitable for someone to use the PSM instead of using one of the vaults and minting Dai \u201cthe normal way\u201d?  11:53 - The next point [re: opposing views and risks]. 13:16 - Why did you propose to accelerate the PSM launch?  14:45 - Gregory Di Prisco: I just want to reiterate why I feel this is so important to do. 17:40 - I\u2019m worried that this is going to be completely full the whole time and it\u2019s not going to be used because we\u2019re going to be at ceiling 100% of the time. How do you see that? 18:37 - Would it not be possible to plug it to cUSDC?  21:10 - Gregory Di Prisco: What\u2019s nice about the PSM and USDC vaults is that it lets us precisely target how much collateral we need to bring into the system. 22:31 - Sam, what are the next steps?  23:25 - [\u2026] my question was going to be about security and what we\u2019re going to do to make sure it\u2019s really airtight before implementation.  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 25:23  Thank you, everyone. Let\u2019s keep the conversation going in the forum. You can look for MIP29, PSM or Peg Stabilization Module. You can find Sam on the forum as @hexonaut.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary.  ",
