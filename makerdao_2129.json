Deco Core Unit Endgame Collaboration The Deco Core Unit is moving toward delivering a complete open-source claim-fee product package; one that will be compliant and compatible with the endgame plan. While certain endgame requirements remain uncertain, we have been collaborating with the appropriate core units as they become more concrete. Deco and DUX are engaged in ongoing collaboration. We will adapt our front end to be compatible with DUX requirements wherever possible. Development of our front end is therefore on-going. The Deco Core Unit attended the SES-hosted Endgame Workshop in Q4 2022. Additionally, the core unit held product discussions with PE, Risk, SF, Growth, members of the MOMC, DIN, and delegates regarding Claim-Fee. We have received feedback regarding our design and usage strategy and how Deco may contribute meaningfully to the stability and liquidity scope map. Through the inclusion of Fixed Rates in the scope map, Maker may continue working towards the native management of its fixed rate strategy. Through the scope map, Maker will be able to choose which providers it interfaces with and set its own requirements.  Deco On Maker: Term Vaults (Claim-Fee-Maker) We have completed fuzz testing and formally verified Claim-Fee-Maker. This completes the testing and formal verification of all core smart contracts. Please find our report here. We have also implemented term-exec-lib (modeled after dss-exec-lib) to assist with spells that manage Gate and Claim-Fee-Maker deployments. We intend to collaborate with PE to identify the best way forward for us to incorporate this into current spell crafting workflows. We intend to relabel the Claim-Fee implementation to Term Vaults to better highlight its value proposition to MakerDAO and Vault owners. In order to meet endgame requirements, we have evolved the previous design we proposed for the claim-fee-maker accessory contracts. The new accessory contracts will take the form of the Fixed Rate Module (FRM). This year, the Deco Core Unit will be making progress on the fixed rate module design and technical work. We intend to have a high level design of FRM by mid Q2 and collaborate with all relevant stakeholders prior. This work presents novel challenges, including translating endgame design requirements into a concrete technical output. ",

Integrating with core MakerDAO contracts is no easy task. With regards to the FRM, can you please provide more color on how this module can be used by future Creator ecosystem actors (as an example)? Are the use-case for this module similar to the D3M, except this applies to fixed-rates? Also, with regards to the ClaimFee contract, is this something that end-user needs to manage manually? And how does the ClaimFee token pay the stability fee? Is this all automated? It looks like the DAI collected by the user will be used to offset the stability fees. ",

                    "content": "Hi G. Anon, Thanks for your review of the product documentation and for taking the time to ask informed questions. In order to acquaint new governance participants with the Term Vault product and Claim-Fee smart contracts, we have prepared a short overview below. Claim-Fee Enables Prepayment of Vaults Claim-Fee allows a vault owner to prepay their stability fees for a certain term. Maker governance determines these terms. Claim-Fee Contract Balances Cover a Term A vault owner prepays their stability fee upfront and this prepayment mints a Claim-Fee contract balance. The Claim-Fee contract balance offsets the addition of any further stability fees beyond their prepayment. A user is able to utilize their regular vault (i.e. stay within standard collateral types) while the term balance is active. This balance effectively keeps a user\u2019s vault fees fixed from the beginning of the term until the end of the term. Since the vault fees are fixed upfront and the term known, the vault owner may confidently know their rate across the entire term. Claim-Fee Leaves All Core Maker Architecture Untouched Claim-Fee is an elegant compliment to vaults and allows Maker to serve vault owners without changing core Maker architecture. That is, users may use new or existing vaults on the collateral type they choose as well as the same vault management front-end. Since Claim-Fee is external to vaults, at the end of the term the vault returns to the floating rate. When a Claim-Fee contract balance expires, vaults begin accruing new stability fees again. This is a competitive advantage for Maker which puts the burden on vault owners to renew their term vault or immediately adopt current market conditions. Claim-Fee Provides an Efficient User Experience It is helpful to contrast this product with Institutional Vaults. In IV, users have to migrate their regular vault to a custom collateral type at the start of the term. At the end of a term, they would need to move the vault back to the regular collateral type like ETH-A. The migration in and out of custom collateral types creates significant friction and suboptimal UX. This is one main reason Maker was unable to deploy institutional vaults as previously imagined.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Also, with regards to the ClaimFee contract, is this something that end-user needs to manage manually? And how does the ClaimFee token pay the stability fee? Is this all automated? It looks like the DAI collected by the user will be used to offset the stability fees.   The End-user interacts the Claim-Fee contract twice : First, at the start of the term, the end user (vault owner) selects a term offered by Maker and the Fixed-Rate Module (FRM). Upon acceptance of the terms, the FRM will collect the stability fee payment upfront. The FRM then instructs Claim-Fee to issue them a contract balance with the appropriate collateral type and duration to their wallet. This step cannot be automated because the user must choose on their own to prepay the stability fee on terms Maker determines. Second, at the end of the term, the end user executes a function on Claim-Fee called collect(). This function collects in Dai the value of stability fees accrued. Collect effectively cancels out any further vault stability fees beyond the initial prepayment. This step can be made redundant/automated by embedding it into regular vault management flow through the proxy actions layer (Maker\u2019s batch execution infrastructure currently bundles multiple transactions across Vat, Jug,\u2026 for end-users) removing the need for vault owners to specifically execute Collect. Maker Independently Manages Vault Term Offerings Through the FRM     flipflopflapdelegate:  With regards to the FRM, can you please provide more color on how this module can be used by future Creator ecosystem actors (as an example)?   With regards to the FRM, below is a post we had previously provided in response to inquiries in our public discord. We invite the recognized delegates to post questions in our discord in addition to the forum. \u201c\u2026.The Deco Core Unit has completed a core set of smart contracts, Claim-Fee, which allows MakerDAO to create and manage claim-fee contract balances natively. These contracts have been audited by ChainSecurity, Fuzzed, and FV\u2019d. This may be seen in the Github. Accessory contracts allow governance to set high level issuance parameters and allow vault owners to mint their own Claim-Fee Contract Balances in a streamlined manner. Please refer to our Q2 2022 update. Based on the endgame vote and with the creation of a Fixed Rate item within the Decentralized Collateral scope, the design requirements for the Claim-Fee accessory contracts will follow the requirements of the FRM, a set of integrated accessory contracts that manage Maker\u2019s dynamic desire for term vaults. This product has novel requirements and needs to be designed to enable Maker to integrate with other sets of core contracts. The objective is for Maker to have a product in hand it can then operate by setting high-level fixed rate governance parameters to provide a term vault service to customers, of its own choosing and at its own discretion \u2026\u201d The Deco Core Unit is currently reviewing the endgame requirements to determine the appropriate requirements of the FRM (primarily from the S&L and Decentralized Collateral scopes). These requirements dictate how Governance will interface with FRM, and how FRM will interface with Claim-Fee to manage Contract Balances. The FRM will also relate to other core smart contracts, such as the newly contemplated ALM controller, etc. Some of this work is more speculative, and some more concrete. This ambiguity poses a challenge in preparing a development roadmap that will enable acute operations while affording long term scalability. This is work we are currently undergoing with related teams. The FRM roadmap and contemplated deliverables will be posted as soon as they become available. FRM & Claim-Fee are a Flexible Tool FRM & Claim-Fee enables vault owners to lock-in terms for their liquidity needs. Claim-Fee may also be considered to lock-in D3M terms with Maker governance. This may be a beneficial tool for Maker and SubDAOs which merits discussion in the S&L Scope. Claim-Fee can Deploy Multiple Strategies Simultaneously There have been recent discussions about incorporating small scale experiments into the S&L Scope.1,2,3 Claim-Fee balances isolate a vault owner, effectively providing them  a custom stability fee rate on terms determined by Governance. Claim-Fee allows this flexibility while retaining standard collateral types and their associated parameters. These custom rates are possible because Claim-Fee balances stay independent of vaults. We have always envisioned Claim-Fee as a mechanism to increase competition among vault owners to lock-in a rate and help MakerDAO discover ground truth market data, which may help inform the regular variable rate set by MOMC.
