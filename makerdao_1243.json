                    "content": "I have thought about this a lot actually, as I take a keen interest in how we are rediscovering basic corporate governance in crypto. I have been very public (1) (2) about taking a contractual view towards ethical responsibilities as a way to improve corporate governance at the DAO. In brief, I believe that principals (token holders) are at an informational disadvantage relative to agents (Core Units). Therefore, the primary ethical responsibility of Core Units should be to look after long-term token holder value, insofar as the implicit contract between token holders and the DAO is that this value will be maximized. Of course the advantage in crypto is that this informational asymmetry is actually much smaller in crypto than in regular corporations. The level of transparency, while not total, is still quite extraordinary and we are in a constant search of ways to increase it even further (1) (2) (3). Not to mention the incredible resource www.makerburn.com from @makerburn which is basically constantly open on my tab from the moment I wake up. No regular type of business has this level of transparency into ongoing operations - it is quite fascinating as well as obviously great for the consumer. To come back to the poll - this is a long-winded way of saying that I would probably support a proposal along these lines to formalize the rights and relationship between token holders and the protocol beyond pure governance rights. Of course, it is a shockingly bad trade at the moment, as it amounts to effectively selling at the book value per token, which is currently well under the trading price. MKR would have to drop another 87% from now in order for this trade to be in the money. Put differently if you bought 1 MKR today and then cashed out immediately as would be your right, you would instantly realize an -87% loss. But as a token holder I think you should absolutely have the right to do as you please with your capital. Finally, as someone who has also held publicly that burning MKR at the moment is a terrible use of capital, I wouldn\u2019t be against individual token holders voluntarily burning their tokens on behalf of everyone else. Though I would strongly advise individual token holders NOT to do it. ",

If I need cash back to my pocket, I simply sell MKR, but I do not have intention to do that, because I believe my cash will work well more in MKR, instead of they are in my pocket. How value MakerDAO got should be accumulated is simply as above I think. Besides value accumulation, dividends might contribute maintaining retention of existing MKR holders and inviting new MKR holders. But the point is whether MakerDAO would like to get attention of people who will be attracted by dividends. I do not think so. That\u2019s why I voted Not Nice. Thanks for providing a chance to consider myself. If I am able to have a chance, please share which you have voted and why as well. I would love to hear why you have raised this poll as well. ",

Somehow the idea didn\u2019t give me any peace. Assuming it can be implemented at a reasonable effort there are some advantages. First it ensure there will be a price floor for MKR tokens. A minimum anyone can exit at with no fear of liquidity issues. At the time of writing it is a terrible deal for the individual holder, but that may not always be the case. Secondly it provides as sort of individual ESM. Any Maker holder that is dissatisfied with the direction the protocol is taking have a self contained solution to exit the system. Thirdly it will provide a balancing force to the size of the SB. If the SB grows unreasonable large, holders can again opt out. Knowledge of this effect, and subsequent reduction of SB, can help put pressure to employ capital in the SB to productive work. Fourthly, as elaborated by @adcv, it is a way to formalize rights between token holders and the protocol. All in all these effects can give investors more confidence to put their capital into MKR tokens. ",
