Theres a huge cross-section of the community that really has no business here because they don\u2019t do any research and they don\u2019t really pay any attention, they\u2019re just looking to make a quick buck so they throw their coins at whatever wall they\u2019ll stick to that promises them a 500% return. When that return is not manifested they then start screaming scam and rip off and demand that somebody go and take their tokens back from whomever failed them. This is not the responsibility of the community or the exchange\u2026 if you put yourself into a stupid deal because you\u2019re not paying attention and that person runs off with your tokens that\u2019s on you bro, it\u2019s part of the risk of being your own bank and if you can\u2019t handle that risk if it scares you or you think it\u2019s not right then you should go back and hire a bank to handle your money. But to try to turn uniswap into fraud police seems excessive and way outside of the realm of what this structure is all about. I mean do you have time to do research and police the different scammers that may or may not be scamming anyone on the uniswap exchange right now? because I surely do not nor am I interested enough in someone else\u2019s stupid mistakes to even try to determine whether their money should be frozen and taken away and given back to somebody else. At that point you\u2019re empowering what, an organization like the SEC to handle this? call me crazy but if you\u2019re dumb enough to hand your coins over to somebody else who then rips you off or takes off with them, then you shouldn\u2019t probably be investing in this sphere at this point.  but the idea of giving the community or anyone else the opportunity and the power to freeze someone\u2019s accounts or take back their funds that is not what Defi is all about\u2026 this is kind of trying to get away from that sort of a thing. if that is what makes you feel comfortable though I hear they\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity over at NASDAQ, you can open up an account with Robin Hood and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy to have you ",

Even though, I agree with the intention, the creation of a list of addresses to only make sure they can\u2019t trade on Uniswap is a old slippery slope to some sort of control or manipulation of the list and thus lose the original vision of being open to everyone. And even if we made the list, what good would it really do? Every here has the power to create infinite addresses and not only there are tools out there to obfuscate the coins so we can\u2019t tell if the coins are in a new scammer wallets consistently. This issue may not be solved unless there was some sort of digital identity or something that would make the scammer still want and need to use the same address or else its pointless. ",

Your insistance on ignoring the substance of my posts and instead marginalizing them with sarcastic names and platitudes is insulting to say the least. And clearly illustrates how little you actually know about this part of the economy and the People who design and power it. This is a space for intelligent discourse not childish insults. Show my homework in school not here? I haven\u2019t clue what that is supposed to mean, but it does nothing to further your idea nor prove your point of view. So I can only assume that you can see just as clearly as everyone else that your proposal has no merit. You could ha e simply said that not not engaged in the name calling and such that seems to be the core of all of your posts. All that to say this \"grow up and do some research before you open your mouth, you are surrounded here by people who are more intelligent than everyone you have ever met. 98% of who will not even take the time to post on this thread because it\u2019s a water of their time on a non starter. They will leave teaching you how to fish to the low grade idiots like myself cause even I know that this is a stupid, pointless thread that I\u2019ve wasted too much time on already.
