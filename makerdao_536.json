Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP58 modifies the Dai budget for Core Unit IS-001: Immunefi Security to account for the provision of a mandate that was previously not reflected in the budget. This is expected and was mentioned in the roadmap. This budget contains:  Addition of Operational Audits Increase in the Total Budget Cap  Increase in initial payout Increase in funds to be streamed     Changes (compared to MIP40c3-SP42)  Total budget cap (including 15% contingency): $634,972.45 \u2192 $979,972.45 Immunefi Services - Operational Audits: $0 \u2192 $300,000 ($345,000 incl. 15% contingency)  The total amount will be paid out quarterly. However, the first quarter will have 40% of the total amount, $138,000, due to frontloading and the remaining three quarters will have the remaining amount, $207,000, paid proportionally.  Specification  Motivation Based on the nature of the work done by the Immunefi Security Core Unit, the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our MIP39c2. This is summarized in, but not limited to:  Identification of critical infrastructure and people Initial triaging service for the upcoming bug bounty program Incidence response set up and facilitation Educational content creation around security General security advisory On-call security advisory Audits of the operations of identified core units supporting critical infrastructure   Core Unit ID IS-001  Budget Implementation The budget is designed with the following in mind:  Operational costs to run the core unit and perform its tasks Operational costs of third parties contracted Legal expenses Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to: Funding an initial 6 month budget for IS-001 A continuous funding model based on the SES top-up mechanism     Team Summary     Team members Amount     Facilitator 1   Deputy Facilitator 1   Team Total 2     External Team Summary  Immunefi ChainSecurity DeFi Safety   Budget Cap Breakdown  Dai Expenditure We will be asking for a Total Budget Cap spanning 12-months, the amount of which is currently $979 972.45 The budget cap will differ from the actual expenses of the core unit. The cap refers to the maximum that the core unit can request for operating and it includes room for unforeseen circumstances.

All costs are only inclusive of all work done by the Facilitator. The quote provided assumes the maximum amount of hours, on a yearly basis, but has been evenly distributed per month.  Deputy Facilitator The Deputy Facilitator will work a minimum of 24 hours per week, increasing the number of hours as necessary as well as having a planned increase to a full-time role as the Core Unit progresses. Like the Facilitator, all costs are only inclusive of all work done by the Deputy Facilitator. A more in-depth description of the Deputy Facilitator is found in the Core Unit Mandate MIP.  Immunefi - https://immunefi.com  In addition to the contributions of the Facilitator, Immunefi will also provide professional services including, but not limited to:  Initial triaging of bug reports Content creation Postmortems General ecosystem security content Core unit focused security content Security advisory services Office hours support On-call security advisory Incidence response facilitation support  Operational Audit The Operational Audits will be performed according to the IS-001 Core Unit MIP. In that MIP, it was promised that there would be another MIP to account for Operational Audits. The delay was due to our inability to estimate the amount of funds required for the execution of this service for the initial group of Core Units. Though we intended to submit this to enter RFC in December 2021 in the roadmap, this delay will not delay the commencement of the operational audit work. We have now onboarded a team member at Immunefi Services with the requisite experience, Tudor Costica, Head of Security Services. Before joining the Immunefi team, he was the Director of Information Security at Consensys and was also an Incident Response Manager in the EMEA region for Kaspersky.  ChainSecurity - https://chainsecurity.com  The company, which provides software audits for the MakerDAO smart contracts, will provide final triaging services for smart contract bug reports as well as provide technical assistance during incident response. However, it is not expected that this would be used maximally each month. Instead, the amount being requested is the expected maximum number of hours that could be used in the event of multiple critical bug reports and/or an incidence response occasion, also accounting for the additional charge of emergency hours response. The current agreement between ChainSecurity and the Maker ecosystem will continue to be utilized. The only difference is that the funds would be from the Immunefi Security CU if hours are used for operations of the CU. If no hours are used by ChainSecurity, or if there are leftover hours, that is carried into the succeeding month.  DeFi Safety - https://defisafety.com  The company, which provides security scoring for DeFi projects, as well as provides recommendations to projects to increase their security levels, will provide assistance with the identification of critical infrastructure and people and incident response preparedness. The quarterly quote provided is a fee for a set amount of hours for general work to be provided by DeFi Safety. It is two (2) sets of 50-hour blocks. The hours however, may extend beyond the quarter they are purchased if not consumed. However, it is expected that every quarter, this set amount of hours will be utilized and a new block of hours will need to be purchased. The company\u2019s contribution to the Operational Security Services will be covered under a separate budget proposal.  Software and Infrastructure Expenses About $7,500 of these expenses will include, but will not be strictly limited to, the setup and maintenance of:  Secure communications channels for sensitive discussions General communications tools for office hours, general updates, etc. Backups and/or primary hosting for identified critical infrastructure Internal organizational tools Team hardware (e.g secure laptop)  Some software may be charged to the Core Unit on a monthly basis, but this one-time budget request has accounted for potential monthly expenses. As the identification of critical infrastructure and other operations have not yet commenced, we are currently unable to accurately go over what this will cover. All spending, however, will be documented and reported accordingly within reason. The remaining expense of $54,000 is allocated for the software and infrastructure provided by ChaosLabs to provide a better testing experience for the bug bounty hunters spending time on the planned MakerDAO bug bounty program. This is, however, a consumable amount based on the number of hackers that would be permitted to use the software and infrastructure, as well as the extent that they use it. The Immunefi Security CU will use its discretion to approve or reject bug bounty hunters from accessing the software, with the proper process to be further outlined in the future Bug Bounty Program Subproposal. However, participating in the bug bounty program will not necessitate the use of the software and infrastructure.  Company Setup Fees include all legal and administrative expenses for the creation and maintenance of the Immunefi Security Core Unit entity as a limited liability company for one year.  Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 5 days of each month, IS will submit a Monthly Budget Statement to the signers of the Auditors Wallet with the following sections:  Budget Forecast \u2013 The amount of Dai that is required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team based on available information Previous Month Actuals \u2013 The actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended MKR Vesting Overview \u2013 A schedule of the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month. Transaction Amounts  The required DAI amount for the Operational Wallet to replenish the 3-month runway Any DAI amount exceeding the 3-month runway that will be returned to the Auditors Wallet. The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the MakerDAO forum. The originals can be found here.     Monthly Payment Flow Once the Monthly Budget Statement has been delivered, the following payment flow will be executed:  Budget Statement Review  SES Accounting will review the monthly budget and check that its expenses reflect the allocated budgets in the budget MIP. SES Accounting may ask the IS team to clarify or correct the budget statement. In case of disagreements, the payments will be paused, and SES Accounting will escalate to the Maker Community.   Top-up transaction  The auditors will pull the available amount from the DssVest contract. Once the Auditor Wallet signers are satisfied with the monthly budget statement, a top-up transaction from the Auditor Wallet to the IS Operational Wallet will be made. The top-up amount will replenish the 3-month runway based on the forecast in the monthly budget statement.   Return excess funds to protocol After the top-up transaction has been completed, the Auditor Wallet signers will return any funds to the protocol that exceed 2x the monthly budget cap.  ",

This should be clear from the transactions. There are four transactions, two of them new: 138,000 DAI will be transferred to 0xd1F2eEf8576736C1EbA36920B957cd2aF07280F4 on 2022-03-01 A total of 207 000 DAI will be streamed to 0xd1F2eEf8576736C1EbA36920B957cd2aF07280F4 starting 2022-03-01 and ending 2022-12-01  The 138k is the initial cost of the operational audit. The stream of 207k is 69 * 3 = 207 to account for 3 quarterly payments of 69k over the next nine months. Regrettably, the operational audit is budgeted for 12 months and the end date misaligns by 3 months with the original budget. It would have been simpler if the operational audit was only budgeted for 9 months so both streams could end on the same date. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t think of this refinement until after the RFC period. With the permission of governance facilitators, we would be happy to make this change if it would not change the MIP schedule. ",
