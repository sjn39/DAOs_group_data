Compare to current:   ADDRESS nonced - different on every execution; 32000 gas paid (G_txcreate), with justification in YP: \u201cPaid by all contract-creating transactions after the Homestead transition.\u201d   Why this change?  Allows \u201cchaining\u201d multiple transactions into one, with a bit of EVM bytecode as glue.  No-destination does not equate contract-creating: see \u201ctransient programs\u201d post and lll-multisend program linked therein.   Why this post? Soliciting critique on why this is a bad idea. I\u2019m partial and blind to the obvious flaw(s).  Provenance Publicly mentioned as OT here. Privately for a year or so. Been thinking this is how it\u2019s going to work since PoC3.  ",

Impact on CREATE:  must still use gas (G_create in YP); must still mince the nonce to obtain target address; including multiple CREATEs within a single transient program.  Impact on SSTORE:  must not persist on exiting call frame, or revert immediately: would result in EOA with state otherwise.  No-destination call from within existing contract, or nested within another transient program:  should already be impossible: can\u2019t place an empty item on the stack to be used as argument to call.
