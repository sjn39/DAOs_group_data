                    "content": "This is a follow-up to my previous post. In it, I have discussed the need to develop a thorough strategic plan focused on audiences. Here I want to talk about the need for an overall alignment at the MakerDAO level focused internally and what might need doing to develop the strategy we need. When it comes to brand and marcomms, DAOs generally have a challenge in the form of internal alignment, maintaining a coherent brand message and vision. As mentioned in my previous post, we and almost all DAOs are working in the technology first space, which means most of the focus over the past many years has been on the software/technology development side of things. As these software and technology frameworks become more and more apt in helping run the core benefit of DAOs, the challenge arises in the form of the human side of DAO operation. Smart contracts, automated, trustless, and unbiased nature of the technology have generated a lot of excitement around DAOs but in the real world, the messy nature of human interaction within DAOs remains unattended to. In a tweet, Matan Field CEO and co-founder of daostack asked, What\u2019s the hardest problem in decentralized governance do you think? Whilst this question was asked about governance in general, the responses to this question are focused on brand reputation and people function. There are two main points of focus when it comes to the real world human side of things, structure and culture. As DAOs operate through independent and autonomous functional unit structures (CUs), it isn\u2019t uncommon that participants within core units will not have a common understanding of the purpose and goals of the DAO that they can look to for guidance on making decisions. Instead, they will create their own understanding that may be unintentionally misaligned with the rest of the units. In a traditional organisation, a brand\u2019s mission and visions are set at the top that everyone follows.  1500\u00d7928 65.1 KB  And each of the functional departments (in an ideal scenario) has to work together to deliver toward this common mission. Eg. Marketing and brand solutions have to measure the impact of all marcomms activities on sales. Procurement and production need to measure their impact on sales. In the context of DAOs, measuring the impact of each CUs real impact on the brand needs several operational links to be established. There are some qualities that all organisations highly value as these have been proven to help with progression; namely proactivity and collaboration. But qualities alone cannot deliver benefit to any organisation if the structure and culture lack room to exercise these qualities. In a centralised hierarchical structure, different business units have to collaborate by working toward common goals, delivering on growth targets, customer acquisition and retention, revenue increases, expense reduction, and continuously improving operational processes so that business units can deliver the best result. That is not to say, the hierarchical structure is a recipe for success, more have failed than succeeded; without a common vision, the direction of focus, and a culture that supports proactivity and collaboration are just qualities. The fact remains though, whether centralised or decentralised, as long as an organisation operates where there\u2019s competition, growth goals and targets will be there, as long people are involved a culture of collaboration and proactivity will be needed. So, the question then is, how can the DAO structure create a culture of collaboration and proactivity? From various forum posts, it seems quite clear that there\u2019s a lack of mission and vision for Maker which every CU and participants within them can take guidance from. At present all CUs operate according to their own mandate. But this can quite easily form a bubble, where core units become highly focused on delivering on their mandate, and to a large degree rightly so. If the community and delegates have placed their trust in the core unit to deliver on something, it\u2019s only fair that the CU focuses on delivering on its mandate. As each core unit is an entity on its own, they are not obliged to do anything outside of their remit. This, with the best intentions, does get in the way of collaboration; because whilst one CU may want/need to collaborate, another might not want to or have the necessary resources and bandwidth for it. And forcing a CU to do anything goes against the fundamentals of a DAO. When we collaborate and communicate we can find areas that need improvement and this cannot happen in a bubble. Below is a simple illustration with a handful of CUs and what the current state looks like (I could be grossly wrong, please correct me).  1068\u00d71080 102 KB  In this model, core units work as part of MakerDAO, but according to their mandate. But here\u2019s what an operational map focused on promoting collaboration and proactivity structure could look like. A CU+2 structure if you like, every core unit looks to its right and it\u2019s left to see which CU collaboration will be most beneficial to the DAO, love thy neighbor I suppose.  1600\u00d71027 258 KB  In this illustration (these are just my thoughts), Growth and proposed Brand CU collaborates with DUX, Dai Foundation, and Data & insights, as the work of these core units have an impact on everything brand CU will do. But before this collaboration can take place, growth CU needs guidance from Maker on how brand cu can help, the only way to make that happen is to first and foremost determine the direction of travel. Once we know where we\u2019re headed only then core units can work in a coherent manner. Here are a few practical steps that could help,  Start with a mission and vision building exercise, create a focus group based on participation (everyone from members to facilitators to delegates) level to solidify Maker\u2019s identity Once agreed upon, amend the MIPs process to include these two questions,  \u201cHow does this proposal directly fit Maker\u2019s vision?\u201d \u201cInclude which two other core units will benefit from this proposal\u201d    The beauty of DAO is that anyone can propose how they can help and be part of the organization, however this can create the problem of over-complication in terms of managing what the DAO needs. Just because anyone can make a proposal does it mean a new CU needs to be incubated. Asking the above will steer us in the right direction. This will force us to refocus core unit mandates, perhaps even widen mandates to reflect their resources and capabilities, eg. Data and Insights can use their data science expertise to help make sense of data and numbers for other core units. We are a DAO, but perhaps there\u2019s a need for some centralization. And I believe what needs to be centralised are the intangibles, Maker\u2019s brand image, our vision, and mission. A centralised hierarchy or sort to protect the intangible values just might be what is needed to create a truly decentralised organisation where collaboration and proactivity can flourish. I realise it all sounds highly philosophical, the truth is in an environment where people are expected to work together without someone at the top keeping a watchful eye, philosophy is needed. Because it is each individual\u2019s desire to help and work together is what makes a DAO. We are at our best when we work together toward a common goal that is beneficial to each other, that is how we innovate and come up with solutions that have longevity without dependency. And MakerDAO has everything it needs to facilitate this. ",

                    "content": "Very aligned with what you mention @Mamun . Maker clearly needs a process to assess how relevant certain topics are for the DAO at any moment and from there derive a Vision. There are conflictive believes in how a decentralized driven vision should be. Normally a vision is crafted by a founder, here, our \u201cfounders\u201d are the token holders who participate in governance. We need to figure out, and I think we are underutilizing the governance tooling in the crypto space, to come up with a process where we as a DAO agree on a set of topics (the market, triggers and its players), assess how relevant each of them are to the DAO, and from there start a less decentralized process of drafting a vision and articulating it into a deliverable that can serve as North Star for the DAO. Everyone wants growth, reduce risk, launch on L2s, but what are is the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd priorities of the DAO and how can we uniquely disambiguate such enigma. I wonder what the governance experts in the DAO think about how to solve this issue. I do have my own ideas which I plan to share. Posts like this and the one from A North Star - DAI as the Destination are getting closer to a tangile route we need to start walking towards. ",

Nice post. You can\u2019t say centralization! Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s haram around here. In all seriousness, decentralization is just a tool that embeds certain desirable properties. Rather than a destination, decentralization is a means to an end\u2026for example, resilience. But it\u2019s also VERY expensive. When uncertainty is high, you need centralization because experimentation and efficiency are more valuable than resilience (see Maker foundation). When uncertainty is low and things are humming, resilience might be more valuable than dynamism. Uncertainty at MakerDAO, AND the concomitant opportunity to grow quickly if we execute correctly, are huge right now. We should be ruthlessly pursuing a single, coherent goal: organic DAI. If this means foregoing some decentralization, then I\u2019m all for it. ",

Smart contracts, automated, trustless, and unbiased nature of the technology have generated a lot of excitement around DAOs but in the real world, the messy nature of human interaction within DAOs remains unattended to.   Thank you for this post and raising one of the most important issues MakerDAO needs to address now. The softer side of things (EQ, self-awareness and social science) is where the edge lies. I\u2019ve been impressed by the deep and intricate work of a few teams honing in on precisely this next frontier in DAO scaling. Forefront introduced  \u201cThe Vibez Infinity Flow.\u201d Forefront Season 2: Vibez Infinity Flow \u2014 Forefront  This approach seeks to place the human being at the center of DAO Design. More specifically, the Vibez Infinity Flow recognizes a primal reality that exists within each human being: the inner impulse toward Autonomy on the one hand, and Community on the other.  Orca Protocol is waaaaay out front in recognizing the importance of the topics you raise, and they have answers. Governance Participation: Perils and Promise \u2014 Orca Protocol  One of the problems with DAOs and accountability today is that many are operating too fast, have fuzzy priorities and vague expectations in alignment to the DAO\u2019s mission. This leads to performance minimizing organizational habits in the form of poorly defined roles and responsibilities. Tactically, good accountability for governance participants within a DAO starts with:  Safety, trust and autonomy for governance participants Transparency and clarity on expectations of governance participation Expectations for work to be done, outcomes and of reward (if relevant) Transparency and measurement of results from governance participation Outcome assessment and consequences (positive or negative) by stakeholders Consequences can come to fruition formally or informally through praise, more autonomy, more responsibility, promotion, pay raise, etc. OR constructive criticism, closer supervision, less responsibility, warnings, termination  And when accountability is upheld, reputation is forged. Reputation is one of the most important pieces to driving accountability. And as you might imagine, reputation is one of the more important intrinsic motivators for individual and collective performance.  These teams are fairly new compared to MakerDAO and thus nimble. Without a billion$ protocol to operate there\u2019s a lot of latitude to be philosophical. That said, I\u2019m confident we are on the right track. @0xdeniz is already positioning MakerDAO within the wider Web3 ecosystem to be a leader in these conversations via a workshop he hosted at Global Governance Gathering in Amsterdam. Check out the presentation and discussion at last week\u2019s G&R call: Governance and Risk #187 - Thursday, April 21 17:00 UTC - #2 by Artem_Gordon I\u2019m also excited about the conversation starting here A North Star - DAI as the Destination, but I don\u2019t think it requires centralization as such to execute. We just need to adopt more advanced mental models about how to coordinate and innovate our modes of operation. ",

One thing that judge\u2019s have is discretion, which to me is not achievable though AI. It\u2019s almost like the judge at that point is encouraged to use human feelings when making a decision. I hope that makes sense lol. AI might be able to be used in some fashion but we will always need humans as lawyers and judges. This isn\u2019t limited to criminal justice but is applicable to the practice of law in general. Some jobs can get phased out for sure such as clerical positions. ",

Yes, just like people do in other positions. A bad apple is a bad apple. And its synonymous with a programmer or coder etc. putting something unlawful in some AI algorithm or something like that. In other words, just because it\u2019s AI doesn\u2019t mean someone is not manipulating it. At the end of the day in the legal profession there will always be need for humans to assess credibility, find fact and exercise judgment (amongst other things). As far as finding someone to help with legal needs who is a straight shooter, it\u2019s all about DYOR. And, if you have a lawyer that is not representing you accordingly, you fire them. ",

AI is an imitation of intelligence.  Logic, facts and science are parts of human intelligence. But everything else is made up of our ability to make sense of things by reading between the lines, gut feeling and most importantly our ability to engage with things using emotional intelligence. Machines cannot learn EQ. ",
