                    "content": "I think so.  The Phase 1 proposals were essentially decided by the 10 largest delegates. Those 10 delegates may \u201crepresent\u201d a large number of token holders but those 10 people are  ~0.2% of the 5,000+ people that reviewed proposals and voted.  I speculate that the majority of people that delegated their tokens went through the formality of choosing a delegate as quickly as possible to claim their tokens and that a significant majority of delegators will not be monitoring their delegates\u2019 voting record.  Many of these delegations are effectively a lifetime delegation, chosen on a whim, in order to claim an airdrop. Here\u2019s a few ideas for how we can mitigate the  concentration of power that has been given in perpetuity: -Cap delegates at a maximum number of delegated votes or a percent of total delegated votes. -Allow the delegation to expire after a period, say 6 months, to remove from a delegates votes the delegators that are oblivious to governance.  If the delegators are paying attention, they can re-delegate. -Create term limits for delegators What does everyone else think after this first batch of Phase 1 votes?  Do you think this is a problem?  If so, what ideas do you have for how else could we solve this? ",

When you are a public figure in a DAO, from psychology side, I would assume they can be biased towards a proposal/idea because of their connection to other DAOs where they are delegate too because they might be afraid that going against the said proposal/idea might impact their public image and/or their connection with other DAOs. This is not directly connected towards what you said, but in long run, I do see this as a problem. ",
