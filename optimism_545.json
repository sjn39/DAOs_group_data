Really appreciate everyone for trying out Optimism Agora Beta with the first test proposal and giving us such helpful feedback. We\u2019ve been reading all the posts, comments, and messages on Discord/Twitter/Discourse, and really appreciate the thoughtful responses. Special thank you to @lavande, @diligit, @TanBinh and the other mods for helping us triage, loop into convos and surface great feedback. The feedback has been invaluable as we work to improve Agora and build the best governance system for Optimism. Over the last week, we\u2019ve consolidated a list of todos and also implemented some changes and feature improvements based on what we\u2019ve heard so far (see below!). As many of you have pointed out, there\u2019s still a ton of work to be done, and improvements to be made. Agora is far from a complete product yet. So, in that spirit, wanted to kick off this thread to consolidate: feedback, feature requests, suggestions, anything really that you want to see built. At the end of the day, we are committed to supporting the Optimism ecosystem \u2014 and plan to build in the public. Our first set of changes from last week, Feb 27th change log:   Fixed Quorum calculations   Confirmed that all known multisigs are able to submit votes   Improved voting & delegation on mobile   Improved UI clarity on the cast vote dialog   Added delegation & voting loading states   Added a profile dropdown to display more information:  Who you delegated to Your voting power Your token balance  Screenshot 2023-02-27 at 7.29.06 PM876\u00d7914 64.3 KB      To no credit of us, this is all @TanBinh\u2019s work: FAQ on how to use Agora   There\u2019s still a bunch of feedback that we haven\u2019t had the chance to implement yet, we plan to release another update in the next few weeks to follow up on those. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming - it really does help shape the future of Agora for Optimism. My discord is also open: zcf#9299 for any DMs (please don\u2019t hold back, love all the screenshots, suggestions, and drawings! ) ",

Causing confusion & requiring the user to type the domain url into the browser to refresh the page. The way that the Agora platform is setup has only been favorable for those who have the most OP delegated to their account. Is Agora biased towards the top Delegates because that is how they received approval for their grant ???  image1125\u00d72436 226 KB  As you can see here it is impossible to search  for anyone other than those with the most voting power creating a pyramid scheme for delegates who are at the top. The smaller delegates will work hard to help grow the network like myself but never  receive any sort of delegation based on these efforts. Nor is there any way to see activity here on the discourse forums or link to their account on the OP Gov forums from Agora \u2026 What about integrating the badges here on the forums with the delegates profile on Agora as well to show their involvement and get a good idea if the person you are delegating too is active or not ??? Instead it has became a huge barrier for anyone to become involved with the OP Governance as a small underprivileged or less fortunate team or individual. I\u2019m appalled at how the priority to fix this has taken not only a back burner but it\u2019s not even mentioned that there will be any updates in the notion documentation.    Notion    Notion \u2013 The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases. A new tool that blends your everyday work apps into one. It's the all-in-one workspace for you and your team      Here is what I had previously pointed out as issues with the search  & discovery  on Agora for other delegates\u2026.!     Top 20% of delegates consolidate 82% of all delegated voting power. Is that concerning? \ud83c\udfdb Governance       On some level I agree with this statement but I also understand how the governance works and how delicate balance can be in the beginning stage of the formation for the citizens house\u2026  As well as delegating a huge responsibility for funds to be distributed to projects that establish the ecosystem in the first place.  It is very hard for discovery of other members on the governance to be heard or be seen.  I must say the new voting platform Agora is being dialed in and I talked to their team to \u2026     Let me remind you that these improvements have not been made all while the round two airdrop was put out!!! Meaning that it was a lot easier for people to continue delegating to the people who had the most tokens at the top of the search, and creating a very unfavorable an unfair advantage for other delegates within the governance\u2026 This appears to be a coordinated effort to control the voting power on Optimism and direct the newly distributed tokens to the top delegates instead of any other candidates. This is a huge problem, and the balance of delegations is heavily outweighed with members who are more active and who do not have as many delegation points. It has caused a major segregation of class between delegates that have the power to vote and change things, and those who do not\u2026! One of which also leads to a discriminatory system of leadership where dominant power resides within the top percentile of the delegates who are not willing to give up their own self delegation power to another member of the committee. As well as the way those delegates reputation are presented to the rest of the community as the most powerful people on the protocol, even though they may not even be active in the community discussions or developmental procedures\u2026 I believe this is where a huge part of the disconnect on these issues comes from when speaking to the teams on discord and the actual governance themselves who are not in charge of running or maintaining the discord. Hopefully this open forum will provide the discussion that is needed here in the space to continue moving forward in an unilateral and universal way that we can all work together. Delegates who have a voice and a passion for blockchain scaling technology on Optimism should be able to have their voices heard by the rest of the governance and help make important voting decisions. Otherwise there may be some serious issues that arise. Once again, I waited, almost a full 10 Months to have my delegate commitment posted on the interface for the optimism website\u2026 Then less than a few weeks after Agora comes out eliminating the need for attention driven to the OP website. Supposedly, I had missed the deadline, even though I had submitted within the last 24 hours for my original delegate commitment last spring. I was really hoping when the second airdrop came out that it would be a great opportunity for me to be able to get more tokens delegated to me, but this has totally prevented me from any sort of chance to increase my voting power here within the governance. It has disheartened me and discouraged me from wanting to be involved with optimism, because it seems like it is just a pyramid or a Ponzi scheme, and there is no chance for me to ever gain any sort of recognition for any of the work that I do here\u2026 I am passionate about Blockchain technology and public goods, and really wish that it was easier for others to have an equal opportunity within the governance of optimism!!!

                    "content": "Hey Charlie, First of all, great job on Agora, overall the experience has been very pleasant as a voter! I just wanted to share some of the feedback I shared on my delegate commitment thread. I understand some of my ideas are more related to metagovernance than for agora itself, but some points are still relevant imo (such as the delegate discovereability):   The creation process for the Delegate Commitment page was enjoyable. I like how much easier it is to modify than the legacy version, and how it keeps track of voter stats. Voting itself was also fairly painless, the interface is pretty, and I enjoy how easy it is to read the justifications on the page. Finally, one big concern for me is the Delegates page. Currently, the only two filters are sorting by number of votes delegated and number of delegations (both giving similar results).  Because of this last point, discoverability of new Delegates has now gone significantly down. Most of the visible votes are delegates which have been here from Season 0, with the most \u2018recent\u2019 delegates being from a month after that. Of course, all of these people are incredible and have earned their top spots, but I worry that with the current system we will be encouraging new people entering the collective to delegate to the top ~20 delegates, snowballing their voting power. This could mean not only a significantly higher burden on those individual delegates, but a more difficult fight for new Delegates to acquire visibility and power. I\u2019d love to discuss with others what ways we could avoid this centralisation, while also leading users to candidates to trustworthy and high-quality Delegates. Some random ideas that come to mind:  Allow delegates with more than x% supply to hide their delegation from results. This action could be rewarded in someway to encourage it on active delegates, or could be automatically enforced after a threshold is reached. Introduce the option to filter by delegate age (only allow delegates that have voted for either more or less than x months) Maybe allow citizen badgeholders to select \u2018recommended delegates\u2019 that currently have low delegation, but might be worth highlighting. This is my favourite idea, as it gives a further tie to the bicameral system, makes the selections flexible, and allows some critical curation.   TL;DR - I would suggest adding some other delegate filters so it\u2019s not only sorting by what is essentially two ways of showing the top delegates. Currently, if you do not actively know the delegate then it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find them naturally using Agora. ",

It would certainly be a more complicated feature (as it begs the question of what parameters), but I look forward to see more of discussion of this direction by the community.  Generally speaking, we are starting to look different ways to \u201cfilter\u201d and \u201csort\u201d, and this is all with the goal of better surfacing high-quality delegates. Some other ideas we\u2019ve heard and gathered are:  Voting streaks Last 6mo voting participation Filter based on their areas of interest (inspired by @diligit\u2019s post) Filter based on their role  Very possible I\u2019ve missed parts or misinterpreted wording, please don\u2019t hesitate to correct me  Excited to keep jamming on this and figure out the next iteration of Agora for Optimism  ",

In terms of new features, on the docket for next week or two:  New sorting: Most active, sort by number of votes casted in the past New storing: Random, random given the person has more than X votes or X voting power (we\u2019re still trying to figure out what X is) Auto save on delegate statements and descriptions (ty @FractalVisions) Display user\u2019s vote in first position (we think especially relevant to anyone who\u2019s not a big delegate/vote block)  We\u2019re debating if we should do \u201cLast 6mo voting participation\u201d rather than \u201cMost active\u201d. We also want to make sure we\u2019re not adding so many sorts that it\u2019s confusing to people as more is not always clearer. Afterwards, we plan to look at voting streaks (something we have for Nouns to give a sense of what it would look like). Then we want to investigate filters, we\u2019re starting to work the design of that. One problem we\u2019ve seen in the past is that people check all the boxes for \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201croles\u201d, so we\u2019ll likely want to have some way to force people to rank or pick.     FractalVisions:  As to this point there are specific badges that show community related achievements.   This is a good idea, I\u2019ll DM you \u2013 would need to figure out how to get this data or operationalize it. Some initial thoughts on our end when it comes to implementation would be: who decides what badges? (Maybe Citizens house? Or do we just take from Discourse?). I think would be cool to have something more Optimism native than the standard Discourse badges.     FractalVisions:  A filter to show the delegates with less than .5% voting power might also be really nice in order to sort delegates for ease of discovery. That came to my mind last night, and I didn\u2019t want to forget, adding it to the forum here.      Great idea, kinda like the random sort we\u2019re going to ship soon \u2013 going to add to the list too!  ",

This aspect needs to be as accurate as possible which may get confusing with the discourse badge system. Another double edge use case that was brought up is that people would farm for the status so this does need some more thought put into it. I\u2019m going to have to agree here and say on chain data recognition attached to the citizen house members may be more appropriate. ",
