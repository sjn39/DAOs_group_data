We still have approx. 37,500 MKR to go at the time of drafting so still a bit of a hill to climb. I know for small MKR holders (like myself) these big votes can seem like something only whales participate in, but I wanted to give a little community support to everyone that has taken the time to help secure the hat. Since the badges don\u2019t always display properly, how about we get some forum appreciation going to all our DAO members and MKR holders that participated? Whether you voted with .001 MKR or 10,000 drop a line below and get some love (and hearts) for fulling your DAO civic duty! Remember we want to have this passed before Friday so every last sat counts!! ",

If you\u2019re on the fence about voting, a cool statistic is that so far 14 wallets have voted with 100 MKR or less! In fact, four of those wallets contributed 1 MRK or less! So hop on over to vote.makerdao.com and help pass the new chief! ",
