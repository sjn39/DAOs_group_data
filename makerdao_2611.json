                    "content": "Hey all. I think we should consider reducing the debt ceiling for USDC-A since the utilization rate is so low. Currently 6 million being used out of 140 million. CRV farming has made Maker a capital inefficient use of USDC. Until the situation changes there\u2019s no reason to take on unnecessary risk (liquidations are disabled, but there are still unknown counterparty risks that should be minimized). I think moving back to 40 million makes sense for now, although this is open for discussion. ",

The risk of unbacked USDC minting DAI and then shuttering operation is I guess an unlikely but tangible scenario so reducing the DC to something more manageable makes sense. Thanks for pushing this forward! When would you want to put a poll up? ",
