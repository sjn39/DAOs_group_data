For the third, I not only reference it to bring attention to the business development aspect (raw implementation) but also how it influences the aspects for the first two (eg it\u2019s impact on monetary policy). For example, in SCD and presumably in MCD, ETH will be used as collateral with a 150% CR and a TBD risk premium. Point being to assist in the mass release of DAI, we should consider a massively de risked collateral package (for each approved collateral) where the objective is the mass monetization of collateral but where the risk of default is laughably low\u2026 So a CR of 1000% or more such that the RP is 50bps (or even less). Today there is no \u201cdiscount\u201d for providing exceptionally more collateral than needed\u2026 and to that end, no motivation\u2026 By splitting between the possible leverage use case and just partial monetizing of an asset, we can lock up additional collateral, mint more DAI, integrate in more use cases, compete with a better cost of capital, get more people paying the DSR and thereby more people receiving the DSR\u2026 In summary, expand the monetary base without expanding the risk profile.
