Optimism Governance is now live on Boardroom.io - a dashboard built to drive greater governance and delegation engagement and improve Delegate\u2019s overall voting and management experience.  OP tokenholders can now track, analyze, and vote on proposals through the Optimism Governance Page for free, forever Delegates can now manage their upcoming governance votes, sign up for notifications, and track their activity through their personal Dashboard  Delegators can now search, filter, and delegate their voting power using the Delegate Discovery page  Delegates can create profiles, post delegation pitches, and display their vote and proposal history across 170+ DAOs     Proposal for token distribution:  A significant pain point for protocol decentralization is lack of governance engagement and more importantly, a lack of accountability for decision-makers. Delegation enables less-engaged Optimism community members to participate in governance via an active governor that represents their interests. This governance-via-proxy enables stakeholders to be represented without following a protocol\u2019s governance minutiae, but it\u2019s important that the small specialized minority of Delegates be transparent and accountable to the broader community. Boardroom Delegate Discovery enables OP holders to track, research, and delegate to Optimism delegates. The Delegate Discovery page allows OP holders to easily find a delegate that matches and aligns with their interests:  Card1234\u00d7886 191 KB  Optimism Delegate Discovery (Card View)  List1209\u00d7847 82.9 KB  Optimism Delegate Discovery (List View) How will the OP tokens be distributed?  80% of tokens will be distributed to OP holders that delegate or re-delegate their voting power through the Optimism Delegate Discovery page to drive awareness of delegate profiles, stats, and reputation, and increase engagement with Optimism governance. 20% of the tokens will be used to subsidize the cost of an analyst to maintain Optimism delegate pages and pitches, as well as adjacent and relevant information about the project on the Optimism Project Page.  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? GOAL: Increase governance participation and re-delegation activity Delegation enables broader tokenholder representation in DAO governance. The token distribution will be used to incentivize delegation of voting power through the Boardroom dashboard natively on Optimism, and introduce current Boardroom users to Optimism Governance. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Boardroom Delegate Discovery surface governance activities that are vital for tokenholder governance participation. Once engaged and familiarized with our products, Optimism tokenholders will continue to rely on Boardroom to vote, redelegate, and stay informed. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? We do not intend to set a hard timeline for $OP distribution. Instead, we plan to understand the utilization rate of the delegation rewards during the first week of deployment on Optimism, and re-assess the distribution strategy. Starting the week we receive the funding, we will be distributing a set number of tokens to unique addresses that delegate or re-delegate a minimum of 271 OP tokens, so long as the tokens haven\u2019t moved wallets since the start of the campaign. Based on utilization from this week, we will have clearer guidance on the full distribution timeline. How much will your project match in co-incentives? We will not be able to provide co-incentives as Boardroom does not have a token ",

We all the different way to measure a proposal, liquidity, user on-boarding, co-incentives, project team and so on, some give value of one point than others. I can only share my side here, at this stage I am mostly focused on; whether proposal might be able to bring on-chain activity, liquidity, co-incentives or and a new innovative product and I see this proposal missing couple of them. Of course, ignoring co-incentives factor as this project does have a token which is just fine. I hope this give you some insights on my decision. One question suggestion which others might ask,  80% will be distributed to users using the platform to delegate or re-delegate, how are they planning to stop the miss use of this, one transaction will cost $0.10-0.20 and reward for each change would be 271 OP. You see, its easy for me just run a script and keep calling the smart contract or even automate the UI.  $0.20 to spend and $100 as reward. Is there any limit how many time a user can do this ?  ",

Our experience with governance across many venues is that anything that lowers the bandwidth required to collect information or interact with a DAO, the better. The request is quite modest at 100,000 OP, and the funds are largely earmarked to reward those who participate in governance.

                    "content": "Thanks all for the comments thus far. Addressing concerns flagged, below:     OPUser:  I do believe we can use already existing tool for delegate or re-delegate. Optimism Gateway   The Optimism Gateway is a fantastic tool, and while the basic functionality of surfacing delegates is similar between the two, there are a few differences where Boardroom Delegate Discovery adds values.  Delegate Discovery users can view delegate voter and proposal history (as well as view delegate pitches), Optimism Gateway only surfaces a delegate pitch, but doesn\u2019t seem to show any on- or off-chain governance history to help contextualize a delegate\u2019s decision making Delegate Discovery users can explore a delegate\u2019s governance decisions on other protocols to inform their decisions (roughly half of the top 20 OP delegates by voting power are also active delegates in other protocols or chains)      OPUser:  And related to other function of your application, they are really cool but it does not require interaction with the chain, all we need is a wallet and i can use your platform, on any chain. Does this explanation help ?   Outside of delegation, the dashboard interacts onchain to allow wallet-connected users to vote on proposals, which is why we currently only have DAOs on ETH and Optimism integrated at the moment, as these are the only chains we support.     OPUser:  One question suggestion which others might ask,  80% will be distributed to users using the platform to delegate or re-delegate, how are they planning to stop the miss use of this, one transaction will cost $0.10-0.20 and reward for each change would be 271 OP. You see, its easy for me just run a script and keep calling the smart contract or even automate the UI. $0.20 to spend and $100 as reward. Is there any limit how many time a user can do this ?    We plan to prevent misuse of the incentive by ensuring that a minimum of 271 OP tokens from a unique address are re/delegated to be eligible for the distribution, as long as the tokens haven\u2019t been moved wallets since the start of the campaign. The exploit you outlined above would not be feasible because a unique address could only receive the distribution once. If the exploit above was slightly modified so that a user tried to move funds to a new wallet and then redelegate, they would also not receive a distribution either because only tokens \u201cthat have not moved wallets since the start of the campaign\u201d are eligible.

I think the amount requested is reasonable, I\u2019m not sure I believe that 80% of tokens should be distributed to holders delegating or re-delegating but I agree that it would be good to make users more aware of delegate profiles, stats, and engagement. I hope though that there are some basic fraud efforts in place to catch anyone who is farming these tokens even right before the campaign starts (since this post is now public) by creating many addresses and delegating from them.

I think we should incentivize more products like this which create tools to make governance easier and more inclusive  Cons  Nothing really. I am just not sure if the plan is good enough to prevent Sybil. So the plan is to allow only tokens that moved/delegated during the campaign and only more than 271 OP tokens?  ",

Value-add: Good Amount: Good Op distribution: Okay Co-incentives: None We had issues voting in the 3rd cycle (and consequently also in this 4th cycle) due to changes from Snapshot and need people to redelegate to our new address or to another delegate. Some commenters are worried about sybil attacks but the asked amount is very reasonable, not super attractive to attack while giving enough incentive to look into governance, delegation and redelegation. The preview of delegate cards is also nice - looking forward to additional improvements & Op involvement.
