Compared to existing alternatives such as AragonOS and Zeppelin it enforces permissions on-chain and can prevent privilege escalation at any point in the lifetime of a contract. To read more please see our website and whitepaper. If anyone is interested, we\u2019re looking to get help on both the EVM implementation and EWASM implementation. Our current work is done here: repo link. ",
