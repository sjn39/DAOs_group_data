                    "content": "MakerDAO <> Hats.Finance - Protocol and community-funded Bug Bounties Authors: Hats.Finance @liron, @Ofir Contributors: @juan, @Retro *Hats.finance creates decentralized smart contract bug bounty programs to incentivize hackers and auditors to disclose vulnerabilities in MakerDAO smart contracts. Liquidity can be added permissionlessly, while LPs will be rewarded with $HAT token once Hats liquidity mining program is launched (details on this lower in the post ). MakerDAO can also choose to contribute with liquidity or reward LPs with $MKR if desired by the DAO. The goal is to incentivize the MakerDAO community and DAI users to actively participate in the Maker protocol\u2019s security. TL;DR:  A permissionless bounty program where liquidity can be provided by the protocol or incentivized to receive it from anyone in the community. Deployment is simple, secure, and uses existing tools like Gnosis Safe. Deploying a Hats vault takes usually less than an hour with almost no dev resources needed. Hats Finance is a non-KYC channel for security researchers to support the Maker Protocol. Use MakerDAO surplus buffer $DAI to seed the initial bounty, and allow any community member to add liquidity to support increasing protocol security, in exchange for rewards. There\u2019s no cost to open a vault, but fees are assessed when a bounty is paid out. 10% fee is the default fee upon a successful, responsible disclosure made to the Hats.finance dApp. Below is a simple table that will help MakerDAO determine what will be the initial deposit by the DAO according to partnership-based fees.   Background: Direct losses from Hacks and Exploits exceeded $15b in the past two years. The solutions offered today run counter to Ethereum values of decentralization, permissionless-ness and accessibility to all.  About Hats Finance: Hats.finance is an on-chain decentralized bug bounty platform designed to prevent crypto-hack incidents by offering the right incentives. Additionally, Hats.finance allows anyone to add liquidity to a smart bug bounty. Hackers can responsibly disclose vulnerabilities without KYC & be rewarded with scalable prizes & NFTs for their work. Smart bug bounty programs are a win-win for everyone. They can be created easily with a few on-chain transactions (it takes around 1 hour to open a vault on Hats), and set up is free of charge. Bug bounty programs do not cost anything unless a vulnerability is discovered, which would be more costly and irreversible once exploited. More importantly, it is transparent, and decentralized and gives power to the community behind the project. Security underlies the technology of smart contracts; there isn\u2019t such a thing as too much security in our space. We strongly believe the future of cybersecurity is incentivized. We aim to lead this plan by creating a decentralized bug bounty marketplace that will incentivize all of its participants. We are working with several protocols today, from Liquity to DXdao, all securing their protocols using the Hats smart contracts. We are in the final stages of developing Hats V2, and would love to work with, and host bug bounties for MakerDAO.  The key advantage of Hats.Finance solution vs. the traditional, centralized bug bounty services are:  Bug bounty vaults are loaded with the native token, stablecoins, or yield-bearing token (Support in V2) of the project. Reducing the free-floating supply while giving the token additional utility. Scalable bounty network \u2014 vault TVL increases with the project\u2019s success. Open & Permissionless \u2014  Anyone can participate in the protection of an asset (MakerDAO, its community, and DAI users). Any hacker can participate anonymously when disclosing exploits (no KYC needed)   In the future, every depositor could earn rewards when providing liquidity (taking risk). Continuous protection \u2014 As long as tokens are locked in the vault, hackers are incentivized to disclose vulnerabilities through Hats instead of hacking.   How Hats Bounty Program Works    Hats governance creates a bounty vault for DAI and/or MKR tokens. MakerDAO will define the parameters of the vault, but Hats.Finance governance has to approve the vault onboarding.   Each vault has its own committee and designated token appointed by the project community.   The project community defines bounties with a specified percentage of TVL payouts.   In the case of a detected exploit, the hacker will disclose the vulnerability to the project\u2019s selected committee, with an on-chain hash proof of the disclosure.   The committee, composed of researchers, project core developers, and white hat hackers, will approve or deny the vulnerability and a subsequent release of funds to the hacker, according to the token allocation specified in the vault.   This simple method allows for scalable, continuous, and assured reward to hackers in the case of exploit detection.      Motivation within a Decentralized Bounty Framework MakerDAO:  24\u0007 audit incentives on MakerDAO attack surface with a proactive approach that incentivizes hackers to disclose vulnerabilities instead of hacking. A disclosed vulnerability means no TVL\\ TOKEN loss. Permissionless vault \u2014 DAI & MKR token holders and the MakerDAO community can deposit or withdraw in the same permissionless nature. Public relations regarding mitigated vulnerabilities and security strengthens the project. Attract more users that have high-security requirements.  Committee:  The main incentive of a committee to triage reports is the potential to rescue users\u2019 funds and the MakerDAO\u2019s reputation. In addition, upon confirmation of an exploit report, a 5% reward to the committee for their work evaluating and guidance of the process to a successful resolution. MakerDAO can decide to add more incentives to the committee members by combining an incentive for their work together with a fixed compensation.  MakerDAO community \\ DAI Token holders:  Join the effort to secure MakerDAO. A community is stronger together. Protect $MKR or $DAI holdings by depositing a portion of holdings to the bug bounty vault to make it more secure. While a responsible disclosure occurs, the hacker\u2019s reward will be paid from the bug bounty TVL.  For example, If the bounty is 60% of the TVL of the MakerDAO Hats\u2019 vault, every depositor in the bug bounty pool will pay 60% of his deposit, while farmed $MKR and $HATs tokens could still be claimed.   Depositors get $MKR tokens as rewards for sharing the risk and securing the protocol. Depositors potentially get $HAT tokens as rewards (when the liquidity mining program launches*) Permissionless vault \u2014 token holders and the MakerDAO community can deposit or withdraw in the same permissionless nature (withdrawals can be made after a seven-day pending period).  Hacker/Auditors:   Fungible funds - no need to move the funds into mixers   Incentivized by the big reward prize, less than what they could hack, but still a meaningful amount   Play by black hat rules and get white hat rewards   Easier to disclose vulnerability than to exploit it   No KYC   Reputation and notoriety as a proficient hacker with personally inscribed NFT rewards   Be good, do good for the ecosystem   Liquidity mining program:   Every depositor can claim $HAT token upon deposit when the program starts. MakerDAO bug bounty program will also include an incentive in the form of $MKR. Currently, the liquidity mining program is not live yet; we are working on something to bridge the gap until our TGE; more news will be announced soon.  Fee Structure / Initial DAO Deposit: Hats.Finance takes a standard 10% fee when a bounty is paid out through the platform that is paid to the Hats treasury. To incentivize a partnership with one of DeFi\u2019s most influential projects, Hats would like to offer a reduced fee based on the initial deposit by the project. Below is a propose fee structure that we\u2019d like to discuss and align on with the MakerDAO community.  Fee structure1920\u00d71080 96.4 KB    Next Steps:  Community members share thoughts on this forum post. Hats will host a Community Call to discuss this proposal with the MakerDAO community. Choose the appropriate governance mechanism to proceed: Signal Request, SPF, MIP, or whatever the community (or GovAlpha) feels is appropriate. MakerDAO chooses and sets up a committee for Bug Bounty reviews. Vote by MakerDAO for the initial participation amount value. Ongoing collaboration with MakerDAO and Hats.Finance to evolve the platform for everyone\u2019s needs.   Committee Remarks:  Choose committee: The committee is preferably a DAO-recognized multisig with appointed members as signers. Committee members can potentially be exposed to sensitive information. Therefore please choose the committee members carefully. Committee typical composition:  Trusted dev team members with stake in the protocol success   Committee responsibility:  Triage auditors/hackers reports (get back to the reporter in 12 hours). Approve claims within a reasonable time frame (Should not exceed 6 days) Set up repositories and contracts under review. (List of all contracts and github repos commit hashes under the bounty program and their severity) Be responsive via its telegram group, discord channel or security group email.     Concluding Remarks The equation is simple - more bounties - more eyes looking at the protocol and the various attack vectors, and a potential vulnerability has a higher chance of being disclosed by a white hat hacker rather than someone that will take advantage of the opportunity. At Hats.finance, we envision a future in which the security marketplace is a standard for the crypto ecosystem, and we want MakerDAO to be part of that movement. References  Hats Audit  DeFiSafety report   We would love to see the discussion going in detail and get feedback on the proposal. We look forward to scheduling a community call in the near future based on the feedback from the community. Thank you! ",
