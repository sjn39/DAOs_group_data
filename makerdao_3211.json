My name is Juan and I\u2019m joined by a bunch of Maker enthusiasts to speak about real-world assets \u2014 or real-world finance, as our working group has renamed itself not long ago. Natalia from REINNO, thank you for being here. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   REINNO  [REINNO] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application - NEW  Natalia Shirsova, Viktor Viktorov, Kristiyan Lozanov and Hristo Piyankov Presentation 01:05 Collateral onboarding call1920\u00d71080 103 KB Current problems1920\u00d71080 115 KB Timeline1920\u00d71080 95.2 KB Flowchart1920\u00d71080 108 KB Liquidation1920\u00d71080 108 KB Price discovery1920\u00d71080 127 KB Discussion  12:50 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Why is there another stablecoin? Why is that needed?   16:03 \u2014 LongForWisdom: What was the thinking behind making REINNO a stablecoin rather than just an unstable pool of those assets?   17:15 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: In which situations do you expect liquidations?   17:48 \u2014 Frank Cruz: About the real estate being tokenized, where does that get recorded? In some state registry or is it in its own entity and then you\u2019re tokenizing the equity of that entity? How is the title traversed?   19:01 \u2014 S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: Let\u2019s say I have some CRE tokens and I want to borrow something. You give me some REINNO tokens, which is a stablecoin. I assume at some point there is an interest rate I have to pay. So the debt accrues in my wallet in the REINNO protocol. When I deposit REINNO in Maker to get Dai, do you expect there is also some kind of interest rate?   20:30 \u2014 LongForWisdom: You mentioned the first step of minting the REINNO stablecoin and you said you aimed to have liquidity pools for REINNO to keep it stable. What do you actually need Maker for in that situation?   23:37 \u2014 S\u00e9bastien Derivaux: I see an issue here because you want a vault to bootstrap the liquidity, which makes a lot of sense, but at the same time we usually need liquidity to be able to make the liquidation on our side. There is some kind of circularity.   25:17 \u2014 Payton Rose: I\u2019m still not comprehending the CRE tokens themselves. Are those just a claim on the cashflow of a particular commercial project? What do those represent essentially for someone who initially holds them?   33:09 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Who actually owns the real estate? Not from the perspective of the county where the dirt is located. It\u2019s owned by an entity or a person. Who owns the entity? If it\u2019s an LLC, who owns the LLC?   41:12 Frank Cruz: Just out of curiosity, have you evaluated this with council about what would happen during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding?   43:05 LongForWisdom: Have you given any kind of thought about how to mantaing REINNO\u2019s peg to US$1?   44:55 \u2014 LongForWisdom: What is preventing it from going \u2014 I mean, even a bit lower like 0.99 or 0.98   47:24 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Hristo, potentially the opposite is true: The smaller the market cap is, the easier it is for one single player to move the price by a lot. I can imagine that the euro or the dollar requiere much larger capital to sway than Dai or any small stablecoin   49:58 \u2014 LongForWisdom: You mentioned that if the REINNO token increases in price, that\u2019s not much of a problem. The way other assets work on Maker, if the price of the collateral token goes up, that means there is more room for users to mint Dai from that token, right? So, if the price of the REINNO stablecoin goes up to, say, 1.1, that means that everyone can mint maybe 8% more Dai \u2014 and that\u2019s fine until it goes down again back to 1, at which point they are going to get liquidated. From the Maker perspective, we want it to be as stable as possible\u2026   53:54 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Now I understand more: Your assets are owned by an LLC; you\u2019re tokenizing the membership interests of the LLC. Is that like a Reg D offering that you\u2019re doing?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 56:13  Thank you, Natalia, Viktor and Hristo for coming and presenting. It was really nice having you. And for those who are regulars in this type of calls, next week we\u2019ll have KYM #05, so we\u2019ll skip the week on the collateral types and we\u2019ll have Lev explaining MIP43.  Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",
