Every protocol that gets listed on Beefy passes strict safety checks to ensure the platform where our users are depositing is safe. This frequently results in Beefy joining talks with these teams, helping them adjust their security measures, and most of the time partnering with the underlying protocol, making it known to our vast multi-chain audience. Beefy also has a multi-chain app. This means that the opportunities across 16 different chains can be compared side by side to choose the best place to put your tokens to work. Beefy\u2019s users are quite diverse, but what they all have in common is that they have been priced out of Ethereum. Deploying Beefy on Optimism allows those users to enjoy the safety of Ethereum, without paying the high gas prices. We gathered feedback from different delegates and they required us to deploy on the chain and gain some traction, which we did. Currently Beefy has 23 different vaults auto-compounding more than $10,000,000 of TVL. We have vaults for BeethovenX, Velodrome, Stargate, Curve, just to name a few. At the time of writing this we are in talks with 4 different protocols on Optimism to partner with them and multiply even more the effect of the incentives. One example of this is Qidao, their protocol utilizes mooTokens (interest bearing collateral) to allow users to mint MAI and leverage their position. This will be possible since Chainlink is already deployed on the chain. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words) How will the OP tokens be distributed? & How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? After deploying on the chain and working with its protocols we encountered impactful ways to get the incentives to work. 35% of the OP tokens will be used to incentivize a BIFI-OP farm. Having this farm is vital to offer our complete product to Optimism users. Beefy distributes the earnings of the platform in the form of , and we have a BIFI Maxi vault which auto-compounds the ETH for BIFI daily. In order to offer that vault we need liquidity on that pair. To do this we are considering bribing veVELO holders, or doing co-incentives with BeethovenX. We will distribute these in between 12 and 18 months. After this rewards run out we will bring to the DAO the decision of continuing the rewards with Beefy Optimism treasury. Edited this bit to be the pair BIFI-OP as @OPUser suggestion. Having BIFI on an LP is enough, we don\u2019t need it to be ETH, and having OP instead makes a lot more sense. We are encouraging BIFI holders to research and learn about OP (which we will provide materials for), and provide liquidity. This will bring our communities much closer. 50% of the incentives will be used to boost the farms of native Optimism protocols. The strategy will be to \u201cshowcase\u201d Optimism protocols to our users through our social media (Twitter, Discord, and Telegram) and boost the vault containing its native token. This is great to put those protocols in the spotlight and bring new investors. Liquidity in Beefy is very sticky. Based on our vast experience doing these kinds of activities, after the boost finishes, more than 70% of the TVL stays in the vault, despite having others with better APY. TVL only moves if the difference is significant. This might be since Beefy is kind of a \u201cset and forget\u201d platform since the only interactions you need to do with our contracts is to deposit and withdraw (No periodic claims, manually compound, etc). We expect to use these incentives in around 12 months, boosting approximately 7 Optimism protocols for 1,5 months each. 15% strategist developer/team incentives. Building a Beefy vault is not a simple task. Every new vault has its unique challenges that the development team has to solve in order to offer our users the simple \u201cEarn more of what you stake\u201d, but in the back, there is a ton of work being done. We vaulted Stargate pools, bringing more liquidity to their bridge/tokens to the chain. We are also showcasing our brand new Velodrome vaults, making Beefy the first protocol to offer auto-compounding vaults for that protocol. We cannot wait for MakerDAO, Lido, and many other big names to deploy on Optimism so we can work with them to bring liquidity to their pairs. This means we will need to develop even more strategies to fit these protocols. These incentives will be used to reward new and existing collaborators that develop new strategies for Beefy Optimism. It is relevant to mention that our strategies are open for everyone to see and use, many times being a stepping stone for other protocols to build upon. All of the incentives will be distributed during long periods of time as described above. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Incentives are an excellent way to welcome new users to try the chain, and stay for their unique products and ecosystem. We will use the incentives to create deep and meaningful partnerships with Optimism protocols, many of which we had great relations with from other chains. One blockchain CEO compared this kind of incentives to when Uber launched. Uber was giving free rides and discounts to a lot of users, and people stuck using Uber after those incentives run out. Those incentives were used to bring users to a superior ride-sharing service. We are aiming for the same strategy here. Make users come for the opportunities, and make them stay for the unique product ecosystem/community. Also at the same time that we distribute the incentives, we are planning education around Optimism, their technology, their unique structure of the governance of the chain, and also provide social events in which our multi-chain users can get to know Optimism protocols, and hopefully bring their liquidity/invest on them. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Between 12 and 18 months. (Extended the period from last proposal) Also since Delegates raised the concern of tracking the correct spending of grants, we compromise to keep the delegates up to date with the spending/uses. How much will your project match in co-incentives? BIFI has a max supply of 80,000 which is fully distributed, and the DAO holds very little of the supply (less than 1%). That is the reason we can\u2019t match in co-incentives. To summarize: Deployed on the chain, locked $3M TVL in 2 weeks. Re-structure of OP distribution. Added community-building activities to the proposal leveraging Beefy socials. Compromise to report the spending to the delegates in the Optimism Discord server. ",

This process requires DAO voting.  Doing so will add value to your proposal but I assume its too early to do a DAO vote now as this will only apply once the incentives are over which will take 12-18 months. But you are considering this so, I would recommend adding this line in the proposal.  About distributing the token based on TVL  Here, as of now you are planning to continue the incentives for next 12-18 month which is a good duration and what I was suggesting is this; you break the incentives into different TVL level, lets say BIFI TVL is 5M now and you start the program with 20% of incentives , once 20% incentives are over you check the locked TVL and release the next 20% incentive only if overall TVL has gone up. If you release 20% each quarter, you can make sure that total duration of distribution would be more than a year. On top that, you will be safe from burning OP too fast just for liquidity. Again, not sure about complexity from technical side but thought of sharing this. I saw from Defilama that current TVL on OP chain is 7M, so consider adding a screenshot or direct link. ",

About distributing OP based on TVL, I have compromise to be close with the Optimism community and communicate the impact of our activities through the different ways we have to measure the success (TVL of vaults, token holders, size of deposits, etc) I think that will generate the same effect (see that the OP is being mindfully used, and the impact of the activities) without locking ourselves with some solid structure.

Would you consider changing one of the pair to $OP (35% on incentives), OP/ETH or OP/Stable is up you your team to decide.   You have good liquidity on other chains.    Would it possible to encourage them to move their asset to OP chain. Just be clear, I am talking about migrating the liquidity which means liquidity already locked on your platform. You can use few percentage out of 50% for this. What do you think ? Edit 1:- You can put BIFI pair inside 50% ",

To answer question 1:  The 35% was to encourage a bribe (helping the bribe economy of several protocols including Velodrome and BeethovenX) to provide BIFI-ETH liquidity. This pair important for the revenue sharing that we provide as part of the Beefy protocol. If we feel this is overweighted in distribution we can adjust. Though other similar proposals are using a much greater percentage to benefit their own token liquidity, just wondering if we should have consistency in what\u2019s considered ok in this regard.  2: The vast majority of the incentives would be used in efforts to incentivize new users and new liquidity to optimism. We have already shown the organic demand for our product. Since we have 15 chains of users, these incentives will help us not only spur trial of Optimism and hopefully sticky TVL but also benefit the trial of the underlying protocols.  Currently we rank 7 in all TVL on Optimism according to DeFiLama. With the grant we will have flexibility to not only incentive use but also build more unique to optimism strategies such as liquid staking velo, univ3 strats, strats built on top of perpetual protocol etc. As for the public good, all our contracts and protocol code is open source. We actually have a revenue share for willing strategists. ",

The size of your project and deeper involvement in the Op ecosystem should be great for you and Optimism projects. Note to ourselves: We\u2019re curious if matching token pairs with Op will become a thing on Optimism too or if the de facto standard will remain moving top pairs such as Eth-USDC to Optimism. Op pairs might become a token sink, grow Op price in the short-term but can be an unnecessary barrier/extra cost for users. No strong opinion formed on this matter yet - long-term stickiness to be proven yet.

                    "content": "Thank you @lavande for opening the thread again. Here is a quick update of what we have been working on with our proposal. I wanted to pull up some graphs about our vaults but our DB is currently down, but will definitely do that in the next update. Beefy\u2019s Optimism grant proposal got approved on the 3rd of August. Beefy\u2019s TVL at the time was $10M. Less than 6 months later we are currently sitting at $50M TVL, meaning a 5 fold increase in TVL despite the market not changing significantly in that period. Beefy received 650,000 OP tokens, comparing the amount of OP tokens/TVL, Beefy\u2019s proposal was one of the most efficient in terms of acquiring new users and deposits. We believe that the nature of the multi-chain app made it super easy for users to move their funds to Optimism, to capture the most attractive yields. We requested the grant to cover 3 fronts, get BIFI liquidity on Optimism, put Optimism protocols on the spotlight and introduce them to our users, and an allocation to cover development efforts/costs. In terms of the BIFI liquidity, as soon as we received the grant, we reached out to our Velodrome frens, which made it extremely easy and frictionless to get liquidity for our pair. We are currently bribing veVELO holders (and getting matching bribes from Velodrome) for a total of 4380 OP weekly in BIFI-OP and BIFI-ETH, making Optimism the best blockchain to trade BIFI. https://twitter.com/beefyfinance/status/1612531815591321611 In terms of ecosystem boosts, we showcased Synthetix (SNX-USDC, sUSD-3pool), Velodrome (VELO-USDC), and Lido (wstETH-ETH, wstETH-LDO). We also ran a small campaign with Layer3 to reward Optimism users to try our newly developed Zap function. METRICS. We are continuingly looking for new protocols to boost, currently looking at KWENTA, SONNE, and other protocols stepping hard in Optimism. In terms of developer allocation, we reimbursed developers that deployed new strategies and vaults. This generated that Beefy has the most complete offering for auto-compounding vaults on Optimism (We support almost any platform that passed our safety requirements) for a current total of 83 vaults. This developer allocation also helped us incentivize the creation of beVELO, the auto-compounding version of locked VELO. beVELO currently is the address with the most VELO locked. You can see here a live tracker of how we are spending our grant: Microsoft Power BI Overall the grant allowed us not only to acquire new users, but also to create strong relationships with tier 1 protocols on Optimism. Thanks to DefiLlama we can see how steady Beefy\u2019s TVL is growing on Optimism currently sitting at all time highs.  1600\u00d7514 47.5 KB  I hope this info is useful and looking forward if you have questions or doubts about our data!

Every protocol that gets listed in Beefy, passes strict safety checks to ensure the platform where our users are depositing, is safe. This frequently results in Beefy joining talks with these teams, helping them adjust their security measures, and most of the time partnering with the underlying protocol, making it known to our vast multi-chain audience. Beefy also has a multi-chain app. This means that the opportunities across 16 different chains can be compared side by side to choose the best place to put your tokens to work. Beefy\u2019s users are quite diverse, but what they all have in common is that they have been priced out of Ethereum. Deploying Beefy on Optimism allows those users to enjoy the safety of Ethereum, without paying the high gas prices. At the time of writing this we are in talks with 4 different protocols on Optimism to partner with them and multiply even more the effect of the incentives. One example of this is Qidao, their protocol utilizes mooTokens (interest bearing collateral) to allow users to mint MAI and leverage their position. This will be possible since Chainlink is already deployed on the chain. Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words) How will the OP tokens be distributed? & How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism?   90% of the OP tokens will be distributed through \u201cboosts\u201d in our vaults. This consists of adding extra incentives on top of the auto-compounding lp tokens. This will provide above-market APYs to the vaults, and will be seen by users across other 16 chains, making them want to bridge to Optimism. This distribution also positively impacts the underlying protocols, increasing their liquidity and helping them experience bigger trades with lower price impact.   The remaining 10% will be used for strategic partnerships with new Optimism protocols to help them grow their adoption, userbase, liquidity, etc.   Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? We believe that if a protocol is good, there is no need to permanently incentivize its use. That said, incentives are an excellent way to welcome new users to try the chain, and stay for their unique products and ecosystem. We will use the incentives to create deep and meaningful partnerships with Optimism protocols, many of which we had great relations with from other chains. Also at the same time that we distribute the incentives, we are planning education around Optimism, their technology, their unique structure of the governance of the chain, the uses of the OP token, and also provide social events in which our multi-chain users can get to know Optimism protocols, and hopefully bring their liquidity/invest on them. To accompany this are also are planning to offer investments that contain the OP token, like a vault built on top of the Happy Road (ETH-OP-USDC) farm on BeethovenX. Giving users a safe place to invest their earned rewards. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Taking the feedback from this forum, we will distribute the tokens for longer periods, offering above-market APYs, and attracting TVL from other chains. The standard duration will be between 8 and 9 weeks for each boost. How much will your project match in co-incentives? BIFI has a max supply of 80,000 which was fully distributed during the IFO, and the DAO holds very little of the supply (less than 1%). That is the reason we can\u2019t match in co-incentives even though we want to. ",

I\u2019m honestly impressed of how active and collaborative is the Optimism community, (I see it particularly in Discord). You being a good contributor to that. About your last comment I think its a great idea, we could snapshot all Beefy users that deposit in other chains, and if by certain date they are depositing on Beefy Optimism, we could airdrop them some OP tokens. What are your thoughts on this? Also could be popular on socials to attract attention. Also I want to take feedback from @SEED_LATAM_Joxes . Its true that we can later re-apply to more incentives, so its not necessary to ask for 1,000,000 in one go. What if we reduce the amount to 650,000 and we use it for boosts and the reward for bridging? ",

Note: Launching your project on OP chain would really help us making a decision, in your favor. That being said I am spamming all the proposal where I have voted my decision, So i will do the same here. Now, I am requesting your feedback on these of my ideas.

Proposal to stop Phase 0 Projects to submit new proposal in Phase 1 \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       There were 20+ projects in Phase 0, some of them has a good plan to distribute the token while other does not. Here is an excellent summary by @MinimalGravitas .  Phase 0 officially concluded yesterday and soon OP will distribute 36M token between Phase 0 projects. Announcement  With this proposal, I want to share my idea and seeking your feedback on whether to allow Phase 0 projects to submit another funding proposal in phase 1 or not .  In my opinion, as long as previous funds are not exhauste\u2026         Accountability of Phase 0/1 Funds given to projects \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       That is a good question, and this is what I was thinking.  For integration fund, one example will be Infinity Wallet proposal where 80% is going for dev and integration - Let\u2019s say project A is giving some incentive to project B for their integration, in this case I think it would not be a problem to share their address as both are public application.  For marketing and content creation (for example 80% Marketing proposal of Kromatika Proposal): - This depends on content creator(s), if they are \u2026     ",

The first thing we will do is deploy on Optimism. That will happen this same Monday. We will start with BeethovenX vaults and planning to add Velodrome, wstETH (when live), Qidao stablepools, and more. I will also make changes to the distribution of the OP tokens. Its completely reasonable that you don\u2019t want 90% of the tokens distributed as boosts. After deep-diving into Optimism I realized that we will need custom strategies for some protocols (Velodrome and Perp for example), so we could direct a small part of the grant for developers to build on Beefy Optimism. Also we will need liquidity for our BIFI token, so we are talking with Velodrome and Beethoven for this. The plan will be to use OP tokens, and match with BIFI co-incentives. Again, thank you for your feedback and involvement in this. Can you advise me in the best path forward with this proposal? Renaming it DRAFT and try to get it ready for Phase 2? ",
