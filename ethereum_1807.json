A solution for this will be to have a registry smart contract that stores the chainIds (in Ethereum mainnet) and allows chains to claim a specific chainId (probably with a deposit to avoid gaming the system), or even claim a range for their private deployments (ie consortiums, testnets, etc). What are your thoughts? ",
