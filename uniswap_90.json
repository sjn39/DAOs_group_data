What are the current policies for withdrawing a submittted proposal, I think there should be a way to force proposals that would have been voted down to at least be snapshotted with the vote count when it was withdrawn, while still allowing a proposal that perhaps was submitted wrong or needs to be tweaked to be withdrawn and resubmitted. Since if only seen silence from Harvards vote withdrawal, I can only assume it was withdrawn because it wouldnt pass. Thats a problem. Should votes be allowed to be withdrawn on the last day of the vote? Perhaps a timelock of 3 days after a vote is submitted as the withdrawal period is appropriate. ",

As far as withdrawing proposals to save face - I haven\u2019t seen this in the past and it doesn\u2019t seem like it should be a problem, as the vote data will always be available and people can see if it was or was not on track to pass.
