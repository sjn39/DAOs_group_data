This was a clear instruction to the Maker Domain Teams to prioritize this work. I\u2019m very happy to say that with the Real World Asset Working group led by @SebVentures we have had the first two risk assessments come out for 6S and New Silver. And the risk work for our second asset originator that submitted a MIP, ConsolFreight is due shortly. Centrifuge has outlined in MIP13-SP5 its readiness to do any necessary work to help speed up this process. We have recruited former Maker core smart contracts developers to help with writing the spell and auditing the integration. And we are preparing to get ready for New Silver to mint their first DAI this year. However it seems like the Collateral Status Index by which other domain teams are prioritizing their work still does not reflect that MKR voters indicated a clear preference for RWA over other assets. Working with several Maker Mandated Actors we have gotten inconsistent feedback on whether the status index is what is used to prioritize RWAs as well or not. Several have said, and the RWA-Working Group had its separate priority. But we don\u2019t see enough progress on the smart contracts and oracle teams. What else can MKR holders & Centrifuge do to make sure these assets get prioritized? ",

I am also not sure why \u201cImpact on peg\u201d and \u201cDAI supply\u201d are separate categories there: seeing as the market price of DAI is determined by supply and demand I would expect those two things to be one and the same. In any case, I agree with @spin that the community has signaled decisively that RWA should be prioritised over other assets in the short-term, and that the domain teams should take this into account when prioritising their work.

But the collateral index doesn\u2019t highlight something great of RWA, diversification of risk. All the crypto world is correlated, but RWA have almost no correlation. As discussed here, diversification is really what drives MKR reward/risk ratio. There is also something that is lost forever by delaying RWA: experience. If we want to scale RWA to be significant, we need a lot of experience. There is also a staffing issue. If we want RWA we need a team to work on it. If we delay (depends by how much), maybe we need to reduce the workforce. ",

This was the view of @Risk-Core-Unit and that is why we weren\u2019t distracted by these ranks and released two RWA assessments already and another one coming shortly.

If we assume that Maker is able to capture a very aggressive 10% of the total supply of these tokens, that\u2019s still only $22M collateral. WBTC has currently a collateralization ratio of 240%. That means from 10% which is $22M of the UNI WBTC-ETH pool we can get at the same collateralization ratio we can get 10M in DAI minted. New Silver originates ~$20M in loans per year and wants got get a $5M debt ceiling to start out with. But they intends to scale up the Maker originated portion of their portfolio to at least as much working with the community to ensure that this is done safely and they deliver on the portfolio they promised. The key difference as @equivrel mentioned:     equivrel:  Centrifuge RWA like New Silver are expected to quickly use up all of the debt ceiling that they are allocated,   So we know that by onboarding NS, we can generate 5M DAI quickly and with certainty. Shouldn\u2019t this qualify as \u201cImpact on Peg\u201d and \u201cDai Supply\u201d as high? ",

As an Example, I would have been the first one to Bet that GUSD was going to hit the DC within 1 week. Yet, its a ghost town. No help to the protocol, or DAI. As a community, we need to support the next chapter: RWA. The less we as a community participate, the longer RWAs become a Summer 2021 event\u2013which would be demoralizing to many who have put in a lot of work into making this a reality. Is there any way we can guarantee that RWAs will be on Daistats.com by January 11, 2021? ",

RWA Collateral Priority The prioritization spreadsheet does not seem to accurately reflect the priority of RWAs and perhaps should be revisited. It would be great to get feedback from the domain teams on this and come up with how we could use it better to reflect the focus on RWA as MKR holders voted to see prioritized. Proposing Centrifuge\u2019s Spell to onboard New Silver We know that the resources of the smart contracts domain team are stretched thin. To help with that, Centrifuge has been working on a spell with along with tests against mainnet. I am happy to share a first draft with the community here: The spell deploys the a new collateral type. Using dapp --rpc we can then deploy this spell against the mainnet deployment of New Silver and Maker and test different scenarios. This takes the state of all relevant Maker contracts live on Ethereum Mainnet and allows us to test these changes against them in an environment that behaves identically to mainnet. With this we are able to show how New Silver will be able to borrow their first loans with DAI minted backed by NS DROP tokens and test other scenarios. We are expanding coverage of the tests still but the following key test cases are already present:  Generating DAI from New Silver Loans!

Totally love that\u2013so, thank you Nik, Marc, and the rest of the Oracle Team. The second is the community has spoken about helping Centrifuge prioritizing RWA (I believe that\u2019s what you said Juan) IMO\u2013as a community, we should give Centrifuge & New Silver the benefit of the doubt and provide the 5M DC. I truly believe they both have good intentions, 5M Dai is not something any of us can retire with(ok maybe in El Salvador we could)\u2013and honestly, I want to believe New Silver has bigger fish to fry. At worst\u2013would starting with 2.5M DAI help us move forward? Let\u2019s not forget that there was a successful Pilot conducted by the Foundation. And in the future, when we as a Governance community have to raise the RWA DC to $50M, $100M, $300M, $500M, $1B\u2013we can explore RE analytic tools that will help us monitor the value of RE collaterals. However, these traditional RE Tools won\u2019t help us avoid financial ruin. What will? A TRUST with a personal guarantee? An Audit Firm working on behalf of the community with 30 years of experience? ETH & MKR mooning so we avoid financial ruin? I don\u2019t have the answers. At the end of the day we all have a passion to help replace the traditional banking system. And we can all agree that in order to accomplish such, we are going to have to take on Risk. But at the same token, it is in the best interest and our priority as Nik is doing\u2013to protect Maker. IMO. ON the other hand\u2013once we get the ball rolling with Centrifuge, and reach the DC\u2013should we the community ask these \u201cLendCo\u2019s\u201d to create a TRUST with a personal guarantee? Like 6S capital. Would the Community provide a 50M DC without a Trust in place? Who\u2019s responsibility is it to ask New Silver & others/future RWAs to Create a Trust? So many questions\u2013so little time. ",

                    "content": "If I summarize the discussion, there was 2 separated topics. Oracle Work: @NikKunkel pointed out that having Centrifuge setting the price of DROP is not good. I fully agree and the Risk team made the same decision regarding the underlying asset valuation (not saying that Centrifuge is not giving the good price, we just want to control our own destiny). A temporary fix suggested by @NikKunkel  is to use a DSValue (not sure the name). Basically, Maker Gov update the price manually. We can have the DROP price with a simple formula from Tinlake pool (like this one). Basically DROP start at 1 DAI and increase slowly (up to the DROP APR rate on the page). @spin agreed to that. Risk can take the duty to trigger an gov poll/executive each 2 weeks. Problem solved (even if we need to find a better solution for the long term). I want to add that it\u2019s a credit facility. The Centrifuge SPV can use it or not (they can issue DROP to other investors). Our interest are aligned (as we want the business in order to generate fees). The issue was solved in 30s which shows how we will crush the traditional finance  Prioritization framework: Here the issue is that governance put a signal request to prioritize RWA that had strong participation. On the other hand we had a Collateral Prioritization sheet in which RWA are penalized. What should be done was left to interpretation. I think the signal request took precedence on the spreadsheet (that is far from perfect anyway) but other can think otherwise. Some have decided that RWA are a priority but only one RWA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s an coordination issue. For me, the more logical choice would have been CF-DROP (which is the only one we didn\u2019t published yet \u2026) mainly because it\u2019s already live and they are just waiting on us. 6S is way easier from an oracle and SC point of view (as almost everything is off chain), but is harder from a risk perspective (higher DC, concentration risk, moe legal stuff, \u2026). I really think it would have made sense to do both NS/CF-DROP and 6S before a lot of other things. We could have done better (and me first in line). Hopefully, we are smart and we will progress.

I never saw a smart contract take retirement in El Salvador.

It is a benefit to have the Centrifuge platform, because it makes it easier to integrate with the Maker vault and also to monitor the underlying portfolio. So in my opinion, projects that use Centrifuge have lower overall risk. It may not be possible to turn real world assets into entirely on-chain assets (though many are trying), and instead Centrifuge takes a practical approach to tokenizing debt related to those assets, as a bridge built on smart contracts.

To compare that to cUSDC, Circle would be the asset originator and Compound the technological provider. For 6S, 6S Capital is the asset originator and the trustees (Wilmington Trust or others) are the technological providers (in that case humans using the paper and pen technology). Now if the community prefers to trust people from the banking industry than a smart contract, that would be a news !   Again, the DROP price issue can be solved by setting the price ourselves just like USDC and other stablecoins like GUSD. When we will get tired of updating the price manually, we will check how the smart contract set the price and decide to trust it or not. I must add that both Centrifuge and New Silver are invested in the pool, they both have skin in the game. So if they raise he price of DROP, they lose money. If they lower it, they will be sued by DROP co-investors. In the Risk RWA team we have decided to ask asset originators to have skin in the game. This was waived for 6S (but I had to agree that 6S, just like Centrifuge are spending a lot of money to make this work). I think the risk issue is solved for Oracles, the question is what is the priority to set the price feed controlled by Maker Governance. The New Silver pool is live and the first loan should be made this week or the next one. You can see the DROP price on the bottom right here. Currently it\u2019s 1.0, and it will increase slowly by up to 5% a year. RWA could be reality end of this year, early next year. If there is a critical smart contract risk, let\u2019s do nothing but otherwise let\u2019s just find solutions. We fixed the oracle issue in exactly 30 seconds with the safest method possible. I keep hearing how Maker was always intended with RWA in the future. The day we lent to a Wawa or a house renovation this will no longer be the future, it will be done. Checked once for all. This day could have been next week. But we will be late. Let\u2019s not get too late (like after Cresco and Aave) and celebrate this victory. ",

I was thinking this morning of an interview with Real Estate Investor Sam Zell about his trails and tribulations of how hard it was to convince Traditional Institutions to Adapt Real Estate as an Asset Class. From the Tim Ferris Show: Sam Zell: In 1989, 80 percent of the institutions that I pitched to didn\u2019t have real estate as an asset class. Peter Attia: Let me make sure I understand what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re saying 30 years ago \u2014 Sam Zell: 30 years ago. Peter Attia: 80 percent of pensions and endowments didn\u2019t have real estate in the book of business? Sam Zell: As an asset class, that\u2019s correct. They owned stocks and they owned bonds, and that was it. Are we, the Maker Community going to be the \u201cinstitution\u201d that only cares about onboarding ETH, USDC, and __________? Or, are we going to rewrite the History books? \u201cThose who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d \u2013Santayana ",

This means that two of the three necessary sign-offs have now happened. I\u2019m super excited to see New Silver to be this close to the finish line! New Silver is excited by the prospect of onboarding their collateral type which is a huge milestone considering where we all as a community were over a year ago when New Silver financed a first transaction financed at the time with SAI(!): 2020-12-07-170022_2542x1114_scrot2542\u00d71114 292 KB In summer we did a first pool financed by New Silver itself funding a portfolio of seven houses, including this one: newsilver_house1200\u00d7628 140 KB For those of you who missed the conversation that mostly went on in the #governance-and-risk channel on chat.makerdao.com, I wanted to briefly summarize the solution that was worked out and share a few of the relevant comments: @NikKunkel initially came forward with the proposal to simplify the oracle infrastructure greatly and at first rely on governance to set the price, like it is done for SIXS & stablecoins (like USDC):  I acknowledge that we\u2019re doing something new and we have to start somewhere. That means more risk, but it doesn\u2019t mean we should blindly accept risk. I suggested a short-term solution on the Governance & Risk call yesterday of a \u201cmanual\u201d Oracle (DSValue owned by the DAO whose value could be changed through Maker Governance.  This is slightly less capital efficient but if updated at least monthly a completely acceptable solution for New Silver to start out with. @SebVentures also confirmed that the RWA-WG and risk team are happy with that proposal:  @cmooney @nik I agree that changing the contract is too much risk even if the risk is low. We don\u2019t force the customer to take the loan. Our risk, our conditions. This compromise is fair to me. Centrifuge, New Silver and ConsolFreight were super easy to work with, we made many requests and they always responded quickly. I personally feel that we are not rewarding the work they have put in (neither the work of philinje and williamr). The fact is that Centrifuge would have been better off by putting a funny token in the vault (which I\u2019m not happy with) than a token that actually represents something. We are penalizing the fact that they try to find an on-chain solution for an off-chain problem. Neither do I agree with the idea that a spreadsheet is more important than an on-chain decision by Maker Governance. Nevertheless, we need to move as a team. And within a team we don\u2019t have to always agree as long as we are moving forward. At the end, the MKR way is the way. We have mandated actors to make the hard decisions for a reason.  Most of these conversations happened Thursday December 3rd after the Governance and Risk call and if you are interested in more context, feel free to head over to the channel to read up on it. With the oracle question resolved, the only component missing is the oracle assessment (a similar one was published for 6S). We are looking forward this exciting moment when we will have some of the first DAI minted with loans originated in the real world - Let\u2019s look into 2021 with many more to come! ",

                    "content": "I wanted to share a brief update on New Silver and the work involved in getting it onboarded as collateral. Assets & Originations New Silver is originating new loans on a weekly basis. They have slowly started to grow their pool but most loans had to be sold to traditional lenders (like yieldstreet) because of liquidity constraints. Nevertheless, investors have contributed over 500k in DAI to the pool and they\u2019ve originated a total of 3 loans:  View on tinlake.centrifuge.io and an overview of the different assets:  View on tinlake.centrifuge.io Status:  Asset Originator is ready to scale up the vault Smart Contracts & Technical Integration We\u2019ve continuously iterated on the adapter specified in MIP22. The first review and official approval was made by @cmooney on the 20th of December. Centrifuge has since made improvements to the adapter and addressed all requested changes. There is also a spell for kovan. This spell is ready to reviewed by the Smart Contracts team and can be executed on Kovan as soon as that\u2019s done. Once that\u2019s done, deploying on mainnet should be only require copy & pasting the Kovan spell but we are slated behind MIP21 right now so this might still take some time. An RPC Test shows the integration working properly. Status:  No major blockers on a technical level but a few other topics are holding up progress here. Oracles The RWA team & the risk team have proposed to use a fixed price provided by a DSValue for DROP identically to how USDC and other stablecoins. This solution was discussed on the governance call  December 3rd. A mandatory component of the Maker Governance is the official sign-off of by the Oracles Domain Team. This was discussed in the #governance-and-risk channel on RocketChat: 2021-01-18-103406_2191x1212_scrot2191\u00d71212 391 KB We have since talked to several community members to review the proposed solution and have not found any technical issues. The Kovan spell referenced above already uses a DSValue for the price and provides all the technical work (there was no need to modify DSValue at all). Status:  Even though the work is minimal, until Oracles Assessment is published, NS2 is blocked from going live. Next Steps? New Silver first started working with Maker & the Maker Foundation in August 2019 and did a first successful pilot transaction. New Silver is on standby to start minting DAI as soon as they\u2019re added to MCD. We are now on the home stretch to bring this live in production. I hope we can resolve these blockers soon and achieve on one the key milestones for MakerDAO: to diversify the collateral types into real world asset backed USD-stable collateral! ",
