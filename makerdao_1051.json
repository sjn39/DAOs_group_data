                    "content": "For this week\u2019s update, in reinforcement of the Maker token holders overwhelming support for the HVB MIP6, @christiancdpetersen and I would like to enumerate the motivation for why we are prioritizing Huntingdon Valley Bank as a team. Much of this has been covered in my greenlight recommendation, but repetition is important in the attention economy. Not necessarily in order of importance:   Wholesale Lending: Strategically, MakerDAO is best suited to act as a wholesale liquidity provider, or a liquidity provider to lenders. By scrutinizing managers as opposed to singular assets, MakerDAO benefits from infrastructural leverage\u2026i.e. build a commercial/legal/technical structure once, construct a box for eligible credit investments, underwrite the underwriter, and drip additional funding to them as the vault seasons and the underwriter performs. HVB poses a diversified wholesale lending opportunity structured in just this way.   Scalable Business Model: The proposal represents the opportunity to onboard $100MM of real world assets over 12-18 months. Should MKR holders be satisfied with the performance of the initial vault, the opportunity exists to scale up exposure as per risk appetite.   Symbiosis: Huntingdon Valley Bank is a savings bank established in 1871. HVB is wholly-owned by HVBank Corp., a public company regulated by the SEC. HVB itself is regulated by the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities\u2026 MakerDAO is the oldest and most robust DeFi protocol on earth. HVB attains flexibility and savviness by plugging into DeFi via MakerDAO. MakerDAO gains legitimacy and a measured, established hand in the real world by participating in HVB assets. If approved, a participation agreement between a protocol and US bank would forge a new chapter of history and send a powerful signal to institutional counterparties of what is to come.   Deep Alignment: Because MakerDAO is participating pari passu with HVB, a natural financial alignment exists between the two parties. HVB will have large and equal exposure alongside MakerDAO. This incentivizes HVB to originate judiciously and to act quickly and effectively to resolve bad debt and drive recoveries when special servicing MakerDAO\u2019s loans to end-borrowers.   Ready-2-Run: HVB will provide an out-of-the-box yield solution for MakerDAO. On Maker\u2019s behalf, HVB will originate assets, retain half of the risk of those assets, master service those assets, and special service those assets. MakerDAO can, through this arrangement, diversify its capital markets approach by leaning on a specialist with expertise in production, maintenance, and recovery of real world yield.   Considering these factors in aggregate, we believe the HVB opportunity, when structured correctly, is a uniquely good match for MakerDAO as a DeFi protocol integrating real world assets. There will always be a varied pipeline of applications looking for MakerDAO funding, many of which are high-quality, interesting, green, etc. Due to scarce financial, legal, and time resources, it is important to pursue singular, key goals efficiently and ruthlessly. In this case, that goal is putting DAI to work in a safe, scalable way that delivers good risk-adjusted returns to the protocol. In agreement with MakerDAO token holders, we believe that HVB represents such an opportunity. ",

                    "content": "Update 5/23 Summary: Term Sheet read-through and explanation of why it matters. Due to teej\u2019s frivolous revelry in Palm Beach at Permissionless, @christiancdpetersen and @eumenes made the pilgrimage to the HVB office in Philadelphia to lead a live read-through of the proposed term sheet with HVB and RWACo. The motivation for such a read-through was for both sides to work in good faith towards aligning on the scope and details of the term sheet. The term sheet is the first seminal document in real world asset finance transactions. It outlines the material terms and conditions of a potential agreement and guides legal in forging the binding contracts. Because it dictates the required documentation, the order and flow of that documentation, the engagement with service providers, as well as virtually all other deal matters, coming to consensus on the term sheet is a strong step forward. Ultimately, the risk assessment will be geared around the legal, structural, and commercial implications of the term sheet. Key Outcomes from the Read-Through:   Eligibility Criteria: agreed on portfolio-wide eligibility criteria for inclusion in the participation facility. Teased out collateral-specific (i.e. business loans vs. commercial construction mortgages) requirements for eligibility.  Concentration Matrix: came to consensus on single-borrower, collateral type, and geographic concentrations.  Funding Mechanics: structured how/when assets are funded and converged on a payment waterfall that will determine which parties get paid in what order when the trust receives payments from the underlying assets.  Servicing: finalized the scope and terms of master and special servicing of participations by Huntingdon Valley Bank  Why these outcomes matter:   Eligibility Criteria: It is important to apply quality assurance thresholds to the origination of debt assets permissible under a participation agreement. Such criteria may be geared around the quality of a sponsor, the degree of leverage (LTV), and the ability for an asset to service its indebtedness (DSCR), among other things.   Concentration Matrix: Borrowers like to retain flexibility around the universe and concentrations of assets that they can originate under an agreement. Lenders want to constrain this universe to ensure that adverse conditions that disproportionately affect a single borrower, collateral type, or geography don\u2019t translate into losses. As in most negotiations, the best outcome with regard to concentration allowances is one that is flexible enough to allow borrowers to adapt to market conditions but not so loose that the lender is exposed to unnecessary risks   Funding Mechanics: It is not only important to understand how loans are funded, but also the priority in which service providers are paid. This is called the waterfall. A waterfall should be structured such that the most essential providers are paid first and then based on a contractually agreed priority. This will ensure that the structure continues to operate as robustly as it can even in the case of cash flow shortfalls.   Servicing: Servicing refers to the actual collection of principal and interest payments from borrowers and the remittance of those payments to note holders. Because HVB will serve as both master and special servicer for the proposed transaction, finalizing what exact obligations HVB has to the Trust and how it will be compensated for such obligations is important.

I can say with conviction that @g_dip , @Daniel_Krewson and Hugh Connelly (Chief Lending Officer, HVB) have been hammering away in good faith and have thus far been a pleasure to work with. Over the past week, after fifteen or twenty editorial volleys, HVB and RWF have managed to come to an agreement on the term sheet for this proposal. As for next steps, @christiancdpetersen has penned a draft Trust agreement. The Trust agreement will detail the roles and responsibilities of the Trustee who will A) hold title to the participations in which Maker is participating, B) execute the agreed upon waterfall of payments, and C) follow an agreed governance process. @christiancdpetersen is working on updating the RWA Foundation organizational documents and facilitating the KYC process for the broker. HVB has been responsive in addressing due diligence questions that have arisen as a result of starting the commercial risk assessment. @eumenes has been instrumental in negotiating commercial terms, compiling flow-of-funds and waterfall diagrams, and refining the commercial risk assessment. On that note, @teej has made significant progress in penning the commercial risk assessment while @collateral-core-unit  has done the same with regard to the technical risk assessment.

We are all completely contained trying to get the deal done. If approved by MKR holders, this will be a landmark deal and we want to get it right. Given the size and profile of the collateral opportunity, the various risk teams have carefully considered risk vectors/single-point-of-failures and have built in protections against them. From the negotiations with HVB to the risk modeling to the constellation of service providers to the flow of funds, the process has been run so as to maximize resilience and more specifically, the protection of MakerDAO and MKR token holders. Accordingly, the original technical implementation, which contemplated a one-time disbursement of 100MM DAI, has been modified. Instead, four independent spells, each of which will mint and disburse 25MM will be favored. As per the addendum to the technical risk assessment, this schema ensures that, because 25MM is the maximum DAI amount that can be swapped for USD and settled intra-day, that counterparty risk is minimized. This counterparty risk is further minimized, if not eliminated, by an escrow upgrade architected by CP. For further detail, see @christiancdpetersen\u2019 LTS Weekly update for further insight into the progression of the docs.  1090\u00d7628 252 KB  Conclusion: As all relevant domain teams have completed their respective risk assessments and the flow of DAI into the real world has been finalized, as long as nothing changes, the HVB opportunity will go to a governance poll as of Monday, July 4th.

Such impressive work in a very short amount of time, especially with everything else on your plate and other distractions that would have derailed most people.

I have worked in all facets of the mortgage industry for 25 years and see huge opportunity for the work this community is doing.  I have an extensive network of relationships with access to billions of dollars in potential untapped collateral.   They could be excellent candidates for future fundings but I need to understand this process better before I initiate those conversations.
