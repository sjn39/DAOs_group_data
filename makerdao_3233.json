Volume metrics did improve recently, or since we proposed 10m max DC for COMP in late January. Potentially even 30m max DC is doable if collateralization ratio distribution doesn\u2019t get much worse. The current collateralization is very healthy because we really have 1 user utilizing 99% of vault type with 320% CR. I may just want to note here that by increasing DC and potentially debt exposure along with it we might be forced to increase rate and this user might decide to switch to borrowing at Compound. Also I think we should push this signal to end sooner so we can increase DC earlier. ",

DC increase, even up to 20m in total DC. Despite the model favoring DEX volumes to decide on DC, it seems there was huge increase of CEX volume early in February and this is why we are getting a bit high max DC of 20m for ZRX compared to our originally proposed 5m (on one day in February there was $1.2bn ZRX traded on centralized exchanges). We therefore believe to take caution here as the volume spike might be temporary and we propose increase of 5m to 10m max DC in total for ZRX-A for the time being. It is also questionable how much demand this vault type really attracts as there is single borrower utilizing 85% of vault type. Same as for COMP-A signal, we may want to speed up DC change for ZRX-A or in other words try to shorten this signal for at least a week. ",

Nevertheless, given the current appetite for DAI-from-ETH-A - it could be quite possible that we are going to hit 1.5B very soon. Theoretically the DC can get raised through DC-IAM] every 12h by 30M, bringing us to 1.5B in ~9 days.  There is already a onchain-poll about creating an alternative to ETH-A with a higher LR that would have less risk on our side and a lower SF, so hopefully a big portion of the ETH-A vaults that are heavily overcollateralized switch over here. But there is no timeline on when this gets implemented. The big upside on DC-IAM: even if ETH-C gets implemented really fast, we can set the line a lot higher than actually needed. But with the current `line, we are limited to 1.5B  Changing the Debt Ceiling Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation  Cons:   @Risk-Core-Unit already mentioned that we need to increase the SF of ETH-A a lot if the appetite for DAI-from-ETH-A is not cooling down. The current rates-proposal already raises the SF by 1%, but this is clearly not enough  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     2500 MM (+ 1000 MM) 2000 MM (+ 500 MM) 1750 MM (+ 250 MM) 1500 MM (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until February 11th 18th; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

We should prepare for the next increase right now, as the procedure currently takes ~4 weeks before a change is getting into effect (~2 weeks for the signal, 1 week for the onchain poll, another week of waiting for the executive to get into effect). Additionally, there is a poll running ending this week about raising the gap which might end up in even more DAI-per-DAI from ETH-A. We already did quite a substantial raise in the last signal, this time I would like to also present an option that maybe does not seem irrational given we are not deciding for a DC, but for a line - going on a really high value so we don\u2019t need to raise the ceiling for the sixth time within two months.  Changing the line for ETH-A Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation if we go with a really high line, we might not need to poll that often for increases \u2192 decreasing the risk on hitting the ceiling  Cons:  we raised the SF for ETH-A already twice this year (another increase going to an onchain poll today). If the appetite for ETH-A is not slowing down, we will end up in even higher SFs  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     15 B (+12500 MM) 10 B  (+7500 MM) 5 B (+2500 MM) 3.5 B (+1000 MM) 2.5 B (no change) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-03-11T14:00:00Z; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

                    "content": " Overview At activation of DC-IAM for WBTC-A we set the initial line to 350 MM. Shortly after, the demand for DAI-from-WBTC-A picked up speed significantly, it slowed down a bit during last week\u2019s sell-off, but I think it makes sense to get prepared.  Currently we have ~250 MM DAI-from-WBTC-A. If we get back to the speed we had two weeks ago, we will hit the current line in ~ 20 days. Since the governance process does take some time (2 weeks for the Signal, one week for the onchain poll, another week for the exec), it is about time to think about adjusting the line for WBTC-A. The recently published State of WBTC report shows WBTC liquidity is decent enough to justify an increase. However there are few concerns about  long redemption cycles that can last many hours and more than 50% WBTC is deposited on lending platforms and is used for leverage. This implies that in rare distressed events WBTC could in theory trade with a discount, which would present a higher slippage for MakerDAO auctions.  Recent calculations on WBTC-A risk premium suggested WBTC maximum debt ceiling of 550m. However at those debt ceiling levels risk premiums tend to rise closer to 10%. On the positive side, WBTC auctions seem to be very efficient and have high keeper participation compared to other collateral auctions. Further, current collateral ratio distribution is also quite healthy compared to other assets.  Changing the line for WBTC-A DC-IAM allows us to go a lot higher on the line since we are not setting a new DC directly. However, as we already sucked up ~10% of all WBTC we should probably not be as aggressive as we could do with ETH-A - I will not add a billion option therefor. Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation we can keep up with the demand on DAI-from-WBTC-A  Cons:  we needed to increase the SF for WBTC-A in the last Rates Changes due to a higher debt exposure. If the demand for DAI-from-WBTC-A is growing at the same rate as the last weeks, the SF will most probably need to get increased as well.  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     350 MM (no change) 500 MM (+ 150 MM) 750 MM (+ 400 MM) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-03-11T14:00:00Z; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

It is not connected yet, but it is going to mint up to 33 MM DAI using this vault. Sourcecode can be found here  Currently we have set the line for YFI-A to 45MM while as of now 27 MM DAI are minted from YFI-A. The 33 MM expected DAI will not be fitting into the current maximum debt ceiling. The new strategy does work well even if the DC is hit, but I guess we don\u2019t want to miss on this opportunity for too long  Changing the line for YFI-A  Pros:  more fees collected more DAI in circulation   Cons:  we might need to increase the SF for YFI-A at some point  Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     45 MM (no change) 75 MM (+30 MM) 100 MM (+55 MM) 150 MM (+105 MM) Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Poll will run until 2021-03-25T14:00:00Z; its outcome will either result in a on-chain-poll assuming the outcome of the poll deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

The average collateralization ratio of YFI-A vaults is at a healthy 466%, largely dependent on the dominant vault #20775, operated by Yearn which is at 520% CR. Other YFI-A vaults are mostly collateralized at above ~240% CR. The mentioned Ychad vault represents 78% of dai minted from YFI-A and even higher collateral share since its CR is higher than others. The high dominance by a singular account in the vault type is not specific to YFI-A. There is currently about ~10% of all YFI deposited in Maker, after the increase of the DC and if we assume new dai will be minted at average CR, we can expect to potentially be exposed to 20-25% of YFI supply; given the very high Ychad individual CR and also average vault type CR, we are not concerned by this metric.
