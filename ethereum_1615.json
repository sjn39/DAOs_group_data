See the Viewl.y channel for the list: https://view.ly/c/2e49c34e9de9bfa2 Review Videos & Post Titles / Descriptions I know some are missing titles and description of the actual content. Only I have access to edit that right now, it would be helpful if people could view them and post titles / descriptions here as content so I can update them. I have created a permanent record of the agenda with links to notes and discussion forums in the Scrolls wiki https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Council-of-Berlin-Agenda \u2013 it\u2019s not fully complete, so please do edit and flesh it out. I have a draft wrap up post for Monday where I\u2019ll be more \u201cofficially\u201d sharing all that, but it\u2019s up now. Raw Video Footage - Please Download There is a bunch of raw footage and still photos here - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wob2kkswtt1sv4s/AABELKU58SjXBxHj-kmDz0mxa?dl=0 I am on a slow connection. I ask that people download the video somewhere so Anton can free up the space in his Dropbox. Can we put these on IPFS? I may be able to get the Viewly guys to bulk upload them? cc @tomislavmamic Still Photos - Making a Gallery I have some still photos I took myself, and then Anton the camera operator from the video crew sent me a link with a great set of people portraits (included in Dropbox link above). I think @mattlock stuck some on Google Photos somewhere. I downloaded the stills already. Back in the day, we used Flickr / Flickr Groups, which has the advantage of some great tagging and choice of license. But, it\u2019s yet another service and one where we don\u2019t control the domain. I may experiment with uploading them via IPFS, but I\u2019m unclear how to keep them pinned and/or accessible via a web gateway. Thoughts? Licensing I\u2019d like to make all content and footage CC-BY-NC. I usually prefer CC-BY as the most open, but I kind of want a shield against commercial entities using it. Of course, we\u2019re not watermarking it or doing anything with it, so\u2026 Any thoughts on licensing?  For all of this, ideally it\u2019s a pattern we can follow going forward for events \u2013 I say pattern, because experimentation is good too! But it would be great to start preserving our history now with raw files and documentation. ",

For more info about the system, you can check out blog.view.ly or github.com/viewly. We are more focused on finding a product-market-fit at the moment and less so on adding new features and technology.

The scrolls repo \u2013 which we just use for the wiki right now \u2013 could be modified to easily show events. I remember that nodeschool had chapters. Rather than chapters, I\u2019m going to try something similar for events. I\u2019ll be doing it in a fork and doing a demo, I\u2019ll announce this in a separate thread when I have a first draft up and running. ",
