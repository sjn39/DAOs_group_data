I also believe this airdrop should be fairly significant in size with lower value but more frequent airdrops to follow monthly/quarterly as to incentivize user participation. Here are some thoughts for spam filters and other considerations: Consecutive Optimism Bridge Uses A Minimum Average Of OP Tokens Held Or Utilized Within The Optimism Ecosystem Consecutive Daily Or Cumulative Forum Visits Number Of \u2018Constructive\u2019 Forum Posts Average Voting Season Participation NFT Quests Completed Governance Call Participation (This May Be Challenging Without A Roll Call) Delegate Participation Committee Participation  Blockquote  ",

So, I think that those who have been active after receiving the OP airdrop before, but have withdrawn all the coins, should be excluded from the reward.   I wish there was a form submission form for people doing PR activities.  It would be nice to promote through various SNS such as blog, YouTube, Telegram, and Twitter, and give rewards considering the quality of the article and the effect of publicity.   Airdrops want to distribute the amount by dividing it periodically over a period of about a month and about 1 to 2 years.  I think people will work harder and steadily if sweet rewards are steadily given until OP and OP\u2019s community get back on track.   ",
