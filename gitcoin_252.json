                    "content": " TLDR What?  As Gitcoin continues to evolve, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to examine our brand (across different expressions (from visual to verbal to experiential). This post aims to share the work that\u2019s been done on our Brand Vision and Brand Mission, both of which closely relate to and complement our previously ratified Brand Purpose which can be found here, as well as our Brand Values which build upon these three strategic aspects.  Why?  This is the second in a series of governance posts we\u2019ll share as we continue to evolve our brand in public in an effort to engage and align the wider Gitcoin community. The first post in the series, which explains key definitions like Brand and Brand Strategy then walks through the foundational work leading up to the synthesis of the Brand Strategy, can be found here.  Anything else?  Most of the items linked here can be found on the MMM Brand Hub. In addition to discussion and feedback here, we welcome additional discussion feedback on the #mmm-brand channel in Discord as well as the #brand-pod channel which will launch later this week. We will also be sharing this information during tomorrow\u2019s Gitcoin Community Call (12/7/2022)   A quick reminder of how we go here and the objectives of evolving the Brand Strategy, including Vision and Mission After months of foundational work that included reviewing past iterations of our mission and vision, speaking with different community members and thought leaders, surveying stakeholder audiences completed, and coming back together to synthesize, we started to distill key pieces of our Brand Strategy (as a reminder, you can learn more about Brand and Brand Strategy in the last governance post in this series, here.) The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions. Our intent is to develop a Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity. In its entirety, the Brand Strategy will define vision, mission, core principles, and strategic approaches for the foreseeable future (until another revision is deemed necessary by the community). The aim is to align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared \u201cNorth Star.\u201d To better understand how we reached the below, and to understand it more comprehensively, visit our Brand Evolution Board as well as the original Brand Attributes Workshop, which kicked off this work. We\u2019ve referenced our community\u2019s past work - including the Other Internet work and the Mission and Vision work To be clear, this copy is NOT final; at this point in time we are looking for conceptual alignment as we continue to drive the design efforts and the visual expansion of the brand.  Our Brand Vision, Mission and Values as they relate to our Purpose As mentioned, these Brand Strategy elements are meant to serve as guardrails for our path forward, helping us to make decisions - from product innovation to partnerships to designs - more effectively and efficiently. They are not set in stone as our Brand, like our community, is living and breathing. They are meant to be a guide in the near term, and so we want to feel confident and excited about them. As a reminder, our already ratified Brand Purpose (which by definition explains what we\u2019re here to do - and sits somewhere between Brand Vision and Brand Mission) is: to empower communities to fund their shared needs. Brand Vision: A brand vision is the message telling our audience(s) why we\u2019re here - our north star. To that effect, our working Brand Vision is: We envision a better future [alt: world] shaped by community led positive change. Brand Mission: A brand mission is how we work towards our vision \u2013 or the \u201chow we do it\u201d complement to the \u201cwhy we\u2019re here\u201d and \u201cwhat we\u2019re here to do.\u201d To that effect, our working Brand Mission is: To create tools and touchpoints that make it easier and more equitable for communities to build what matters.\u201d Brand Values: Our brand values are tied to the foundational beliefs we stand for. They refer to the \u201cideals\u201d guiding our actions and decisions.  Empowerment: We define empowerment as giving others the tools to step into their power and do something Impact: We define impact as having a measurable effect or influence Mutuality: We define mutuality as the sharing of feeling, action, or relationships Trust: We define trust as the belief in the reliability and intent of someone or something Forward Thinking: We define forward thinking as favoring innovation and progress as tools for building a better future  Again, we are sharing these for feedback as our hope is to align, engage and discuss. We welcome ALL feedback. Once we\u2019ve aligned on the Brand Strategy, we will use it as a lens through which to continuously evaluate and refine design. Whether or not we move forward with a brand refresh, rebrand, or something in between is up to us - the main goal is to ensure there is intentionality behind our design elements, and that we feel confident our brand expressions uphold our strategy.  Share your feedback! We welcome all feedback and questions at this stage and invite you to discuss this further during our Gitcoin Community Call (FKA DAO Vibes) takeover on 12/7. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for reiterating here @shawn16400 In the Gitcoin Community Call this week we had a discussion of some of these points that I felt created open loops. Maybe we can try to close them here. On that call there were a few points mentioned that I thought were interesting and wanted to share with the wider community:  from @shawn16400: I miss the linkage to core web3 ethos: decentralization, autonomy, and transparency.  On vision: We envision a better future [alt: world] shaped by community led positive change.  from @shawn16400: \u201cShaped by community led positive change\u201d  is a mouthful. I love the direction and can get behind it, but when you get to wordsmithing, ideally we end on something a little more flow-ey   from @Viriya:  Suggestion for vision: we envision a flourishing world shaped by empowered communities.    from @garysheng: suggestion for vision: We envision a world shaped by community-led positive change  I feel the proposed vision is directionally right but needs some wordsmithing as I feel that \u201cbetter\u201d feels too preachy and \u201cfuture\u201d doesn\u2019t ground us in the present enough (I much prefer \u201cworld\u201d - especially in an intentional contrast (but not contradiction) of our brand value of \u201cforward thinking\u201d. On mission: To create tools and touchpoints that make it easier and more equitable for communities to build what matters.  @garysheng: touchpoint is really inaccessible (to me at least)   @Jodi_GitcoinDAO: I disagree that we can keep it to just \u201ctools\u201d [as someone else suggested] and I think touchpoint is directionally right.  I personally feel that \u201ctouchpoints\u201d is directionally right but we might look at another word for that. Would love to understand why you\u2019ve moved away from \u201ccreate solutions, from programs to protocols\u201d as this seems most accurate to me.  On another note, I think it\u2019s also worth mentioning that we\u2019ve been working on missions for our individual products.  @krrisis I hope the core program product branding & its mission will focus very specifically on open source & public goods  If we consider the grants program a \u201cproduct\u201d then it might make sense to have that focused on building open source & public goods. Alternatively, if we consider the program a brand activation/marketing tool for our protocols then would this impact the overall Gitcoin mission? Our historical focus on open source & public goods is both important to highlight (for me personally) but also noting that a mission should direct business decisions and influence organisational goal setting - from what I\u2019ve heard from the partnerships team, we don\u2019t have enough certainty around which verticals we are pursuing yet. I\u2019m concerned that having a mission that focuses too specifically on open source or even public goods might limit the potential of the protocols as we are seeing increased interest from the NGO/impact space. Therefore, I think something closer to the above suggestions are safer to try. I think with this approach we can activate the mission and vision with a more specific brand expression like manifesto or theory of change that is bolstered by different campaigns that more explicitly state what we stand for in this moment in time (and those can evolve with us over time - a mission is harder to change)  @benwest said it well: What is going to work for a web3 native, public good audience may be very different than what resonates with or is understandable for say a potential partner from an organization like for example Serena Ventures or another org in the tech space focused on what we would call public goods that might be less clear about who we are and what we do for them and their community.  And, finally, on \u201cMutuality\u201d as a brand value: We did a lot of back and forth about this term. Collaboration felt too literal, coordination didn\u2019t feel human enough and mutuality (defined is a positive, interactive relationship between people) aims to emcompass the vibe of \u201cco-creation\u201d, \u201ccollaboration\u201d, \u201ccoordination\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d in one. Happy to explore this word further as I think this one got the most question marks. Hoping this spurs on some convo about this important topic! ",

                    "content": "Thanks @Viriya for this additional context! One comment on the mission - the reason we moved away from \u201csolutions from programs to protocols\u201d was twofold:   Solutions: There was some original feedback that the word solution suggests we are only solving problems (reactive) when in fact our tools are something entirely different/show a new way of thinking (proactive); additionally, there was feedback that we didn\u2019t want to seem too much like \u201csaviors,\u201d coming to solve the world\u2019s problems or fixing past wrongs  Programs to Protocols: There was discussion that what we do goes beyond just programs and protocols, so we wanted something more encompassing of the other things we do (events, thought leadership, potentially eventual services), although the use of the \u201cfrom\u2026to\u2026\u201d may sufficiently allude to the fact that we do more  A few other comments: Empowerment: I tend to advise against the repeated use of action words across mission, vision and purpose as they tend to lose their punch, which is why I recommended communlity-led positive change, although I do think the use of empowered communities works here; I do like the idea of \u201ccommunity-led positive change\u201d  supporting the IMPACT brand value we identified Flourishing: This is a personal opinion, but I question if this fits our working personality and tone, which we describe as relatable and plainspoken - which is the perfect segue into the next post in this series, which is about Personality and Voice.

                    "content": " TLDR What?  As Gitcoin continues to evolve, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to examine our brand (across different expressions (from visual to verbal to experiential). This post aims to explore what brand means and why it matters, and then examines how we can actively evolve ours to meet the needs determined by this next phase of our evolution, the launch of new protocols. It then summarizes the work we\u2019ve done thus far to evolve our brand strategy in order to inform future design and marketing decisions.  Why?  The hope is that this is the first of many posts on this forum for us to explore brand in public together as we embrace our status as a headless brand.  Anything else?  Most of the items linked here can be found on the MMM Brand Hub. In addition to discussion and feedback here, we welcome additional discussion feedback on the #mmm-brand channel in Discord as well as the Brand Pod channel which will launch shortly.   Gitcoin is evolving, and so should our Brand Gitcoin was founded with the purpose to further the development and funding of open source software. Over the years, how we fulfilled that purpose changed - from bounties to hackathons to Gitcoin Grants. So has how we describe our purpose, switching between words like open source, public goods, and most recently, shared needs. In the same vein, as our vernacular has evolved, so has our look and feel. Illustrations have shifted from robots to astronauts, colors have shifted from dark to light to dark again. We\u2019ve also had open forum discussions call attention to our evolving language and visual identity. Today, we\u2019re at a critical point in our evolution, perhaps as critical as when we unlocked the potential of Quadratic Funding, the mechanism that has to date made our Grants Program so successful. We\u2019ve taken years of learnings and turned insights into action, creating a range of pluralistic tools that can be leveraged at scale, opening unprecedented opportunities for local communities and their supporters to build for global impact. And with this change - this next phase of our evolution - comes the need to re-look at ourselves, and in particular, our brand - which is much more than our logo and illustration style, it\u2019s the emotional connection that comes from the total sum of expressions by which we\u2019re recognized. Inevitably, as we evolve, so do these expressions. But how?  First, what\u2019s brand and why does it matter? The topic of brand \u2013 and more specifically, brand strategy \u2013 is one that cannot be simplified, especially at a \u201cdecentralized brand,\u201d or, as others sometimes refer to it, a \u201cheadless brand.\u201d This section will address:  What is Brand What is a Decentralized Brand What is Brand Strategy What is a Decentralized Brand Strategy Why does Brand Strategy matter  The terms brand and brand strategy are frequently used interchangeably. There isn\u2019t always a shared, clear understanding of what they actually mean, or how they\u2019re different from each other. This lack of clarity can sometimes result in misunderstanding \u2013 and a communication breakdown around a critical part of any organization or business. So first goal: define Brand. For many modern companies, their brand is their single most valuable asset. Nike. Patagonia. Coca Cola. This is also becoming true for many recognizable brands in the web3 space - Uniswap, Aave, Lens, Zora, FWB. What first comes to mind when you think brand? Probably logo. Maybe color. Maybe typography. But it\u2019s also likely something else; something intangible yet incredibly powerful at the same time. It\u2019s a feeling. It\u2019s the gut reaction that happens when someone thinks of the brand. It\u2019s not just the logo, the font, the color palette. It\u2019s more than the visual identity (all of those things \u2013 logo, font, palette - plus other visual elements like iconography.) It\u2019s more than the verbal identity (the vernacular or words you use, voice, and tone.) Brand is the emotional connection that our audience, community and customers have with our organization. It is shaped by our name, logo, overall visual and verbal identity, marketing and advertising, and\u2014most importantly\u2014the experiences customers associate with us. It\u2019s the sum of all expressions by which an entity (person, organization, company, business unit, city, nation, etc.) intends to be recognized. This means:  How people identify us How we express ourselves How we create a shared understanding, appreciation or association \u2026through visual cues like logo, color palette and typography \u2026through written cues like ownable vernacular \u2026through memes \u2026through serial content like blogs, podcasts \u2026through events and experiences online and off  A few things brand has the power to do:  Garner loyalty Inspire word-of-mouth marketing Set you apart from other competitors in the marketplace Allow you to command premium pricing for your products or services  Brand is not in our direct control \u2013 it\u2019s in the minds of our community. This is true for all brands, not just decentralized ones. A decentralized brand, as defined by Other Internet, belongs to no one, and can be remixed by anyone. It\u2019s a meme. It can only be \u201cdesigned\u201d in a very limited sense. It has its own autonomy, generated by the contributions of individual actors, a million person chorus acting as one. That said, there are ways we can take action to shape our brand indirectly in order to strengthen it and shift perception. How do we decide on those actions? How do we even know what kind of brand we want to have? How do we decide how we want to be perceived? How do we help shape the way our community perceives us as a whole? This is where brand strategy comes into play. Brand strategy is the \u2018big picture\u2019 plans and tactics deployed by an organization to create long-term brand equity and competitive advantages from branding. Aka, it\u2019s:  a plan to actively influence how people perceive our brand clarifies where we\u2019re headed defines what we\u2019re are trying to achieve provides a map and compass, setting a True North so to speak, to help us get there helps us figure out what to do, and perhaps even more importantly, what not to do  It\u2019s not (important clarification here!)  a business strategy, which is also being worked on simultaneously.  According to Other Internet, \u201cheadless brand strategy is an ecosystemic affair and entails the mobilization of a decentralized set of actors. At its core, it revolves around giving agency to different stakeholders in a way that lets them coordinate more effectively and feel connected to the brand. What projects can do, in this context, is provide the resources, tools, and wayfinding devices for different stakeholders to converge around a single narrative.\u201d We love a good iceberg meme - here\u2019s one for Brand:  700\u00d7460 120 KB  Why is Brand Strategy important?  To help us articulate and communicate our core values: People usually buy into why you do what you do before they buy into what you do. To attract and retain loyal contributors we must understand and communicate what we stand for. To help us identify weaknesses in our brand experience: If the experiences our audiences have interacting with us aren\u2019t consistent, we\u2019ll struggle to build trust and customer loyalty. To filter out ill-advised ideas that would damage your brand-building efforts: It\u2019s easy to succumb to shiny-object syndrome. A clear brand strategy makes it easier to make prudent decisions. To create accountability: Committing to a clear brand strategy helps keep everyone in the organization accountable, focused on high-yield initiatives that will actually move the needle. It helps us stay on track. To focus our marketing efforts: By narrowing and clarifying the scope of your marketing efforts, we can ensure smoother and more effective execution of marketing campaigns. We know who we\u2019re targeting, we know what they care about, and we know how to speak to them. To help designers and creatives do better, more effective work. Without a strategy to underpin creative decisions, they are inherently subjective and arbitrary. To align and engage the team in the vision: A major part of the brand strategy process is getting our team to buy into the vision and values of our brand.  Components of an effective brand strategy  Values: These are the beliefs that inform everything we do. Vision: The message that speaks to our target audience, telling them what we\u2019re here to do and why we\u2019re here to do it. It tells them what to expect when they interact with our brand. Mission: A brand mission is how we work towards our vision \u2013 or the \u201chow we do it\u201d complement to the \u201cwhat are we here to do\u201d. Positioning statement: A positioning statement encompasses all of the above and effectively communicates value proposition to your ideal customer or target audience(s). Audience: This is who we\u2019re here for - and our target audience should be laser focused. Voice and tone (as well as specific messaging/vernacular): A framework around how we communicate. Look and feel of our brand identity: A good strategy can guide the creative expressions of our brand identity to make sure they are aligned with our positioning goals and the tastes of our main audiences. BONUS!: Prioritized brand touchpoints and awareness-drivers: Brand touchpoints are any points of contact between our business and our audience/users. They can include website, email newsletter, social media accounts, events, and merch\u2014to just name a few.  Ultimately, a good brand strategy will help you focus on the most important, high-yield touchpoints to avoid spreading your organization too thin. When not building a brand from the ground up, there are two ways we can talk about updating Brand Identity. They are brand refresh and rebrand. A brand refresh is when a brand attempts to modernize its image while maintaining its core identity and strategy. A rebrand is a complete overhaul of the brand\u2019s identity and strategy, typically enacted when the current brand strategy fails. At Gitcoin, we haven\u2019t had a clearly defined brand strategy informing design in the past, thus it is challenging to objectively say whether or not we\u2019ve succeeded or failed. However, given the success of our Grants Programs, which can be considered our \u201cMVP,\u201d the subsequent initiatives that have succeeded and ultimately \u201cspun out\u201d of Gitcoin, and the brand affinity and equity we\u2019ve established among our core audiences, it is appropriate to say we enter this next phase of our evolution with a range of achievements, and therefore owe attention to past visual and verbal expressions.  What\u2019s been going on with the brand evolution work so far? Brand Strategies begin with insights and research, which is what we\u2019ve been doing since this initiative kicked off a few months ago. We began the brand evolution work with a DAO-wide brand attributes workshop during a DAO-vibes takeover. Since then, we\u2019ve conducted numerous discovery interviews, competitive/landscape research and working sessions in order to put pen to paper on a brand strategy that can inform the intentional evolution of those brand expressions - from typography and color palette to tone and merch. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re excited to begin sharing in the hope to kickoff a robust discussion around brand, and answer any questions you might have about this work. Below summarizes our work to date, including:  Brand Attributes Workshop Discovery Interviews Brand Strategy Audit Brand Visual Audit Brand Working Group Work Market/Competitive Insights  All of this is the foundation upon which we\u2019re building a brand strategy. We hope that by sharing this here we can gather any questions and comments that arise and in turn answer them through future discussion forums.  II. Brand Attributes Workshop To kick off the brand evolution work, we hosted a Brand Attributes workshop where we asked the community key questions from which themes started to emerge. These informed the themes we explored further in subsequent working group sessions as well as in key interviews. See FigJam here. The TLDR:  Questions we asked:  What makes us different? How would others describe us? How do we sound to others? What impact will we have? How do people feel interacting with us?   Themes that emerged: We are unbound by existing systems We are hopeful for a better future We empower people to make positive change We enable regenerative initiatives We celebrate the many, not the few We believe in the power of collaboration over competition We educate around the value of public goods We welcome people with open arms We are leaders not followers We create foundational infrastructure - things to be built on top of We help foster more equitable, whole lives We invest in our community and their communities   III. Discovery Interviews Next, we interviewed key thought leaders across the organization, asking them a series of questions that would help us distill key insights (specifically areas of alignment and misalignment), uncover key strategic opportunities, understand history and flag challenges. Find full Discovery Findings here. The TLDR:  Where We Are: We\u2019re in the in between - a state of flux - but we know there\u2019s greatness in our future. What We Do & Why We Do It: We\u2019re mission aligned and inspired - we empower communities to fund their shared needs. This expansive purpose shapes our product vision. What & Who We\u2019re Here For: We are for the greater good. We\u2019re human centric and community first - and we build in service of their needs. What\u2019s Next: Our current brand identity isn\u2019t always serving us - and there are opportunities for us to optimize to make the community feel more connected to our vision. A lot of what\u2019s been done in the past was \u201cyolo\u2019ed,\u201d and we\u2019re ready to be more intentional with our visual and verbal expressions.   III. Brand Strategy Audit Simultaneously, we reviewed publicly available expressions of Brand Strategy (Mission, Vision, etc.). As part of our work, we reviewed and referenced our community\u2019s past work - including but not limited to:  the Other Internet work  Mission and Vision work Feedback on Mission and Vision work  Find entire Brand Audit here. The TLDR:  Challenge 1: Lack of Cohesive Narrative Across Past, Present & Future: There was no single source for our brand narrative - the where we\u2019ve been, where we are, where we\u2019re going, which made it challenging identify intentional Challenge 2: Mission Cohesion: expressed in different ways in various places across owned and partner channels Challenge 3: No Defined Community Aligned Values: our values were never clearly codified for our community - and while they were several iterations of them, none felt wholly embraced Challenge 4: No Defined Personality Traits: while our brand has a personality, it often feels like an afterthought, and was never specifically defined in a set of traits acknowledged as ours Challenge 5: Inconsistent Messaging: Overall inconsistencies; Style, tone and comms hierarchy are unclear; often lacking call to action and reliant on descriptive, prescriptive language rather than inspiring or insightful     IV. Brand Visual Audit Next, we reviewed publicly available expressions of Brand Identity (Logo, Illustration/Graphics, Web Design, etc.) to showcase where our Strategy and Identity are working in or out of alignment in order to make strategic recommendations for future design considerations.). As part of our work, we reviewed and referenced specific visual expressions across touchpoints including but not limited to:  http://decentralized.quadraticlands.com/ https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/ https://passport.gitcoin.co/ https://gitcoin.co/  Find entire Brand Audit here. The TLDR:  Challenge 1: Logo Cohesion: There are inconsistencies in how our logo and lockups are used Challenge 2: The Astronaut (or Robo) as a Symbol: While we use this as a symbol, some of the symbolic elements are misaligned with what we do Challenge 3: Iconography & Illustration: Iconography style inconsistencies which can create confusion and mistrust Challenge 4: Website Visual Impact: Across certain touchpoints, we\u2019ve intentionally created moments for users to feel connected and engaged with the overall experience - but interactive elements are inconsistent and lack relevance to our messages/intentions Challenge 5: Inconsistencies Across Product & Protocol: \u201cVibe\u201d inconsistencies across product and protocols   V. Brand Working Group We created a smaller working group (a precursor to what we\u2019re now calling Pods - comprised of cross-workstream contributors) to begin ideating around Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity. To better understand our process, visit our Brand Evolution Board The TLDR:  Our aim was to begin to define how we would align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared \u201cNorth Star.\u201d Here, we looked closely at the role of audience within the strategy, reviewing past surveys to understand audience needs and where their current affinities lie We examined our product pipeline and positioning to better understand where we fit in the market today and where we\u2019re going We took into consideration our own organization - the DAO - and what that means in relation to brand strategy We began to define our mission, vision and values, the foundation of the brand strategy Last, we shared this work with a bigger working group for feedback, as well as with Design contributors in order to begin looking at design considerations - and that\u2019s where we are today!   VI. Market/Competitive Insights While we strive for originality, we must also take into consideration market trends and forces as well as what our \u201ccompetitors\u201d are saying and doing. This helps us ensure we\u2019ve got an edge but are also remaining top of the game. Here\u2019s a summary of our findings.  What\u2019s next? Honing our brand strategy With this foundational work completed, we\u2019re looking to define our Brand Strategy. The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions. This diagram sums up our process and where we are (definition): 1161\u00d7398 252 KB  We\u2019ll be sharing the Brand Strategy for commentary soon, and appreciate any and all feedback. Once we\u2019ve aligned on the Brand Strategy, we will use it as a lens through which to continuously evaluate and refine design. From a design perspective, our goals will be to:  Strengthen the connection to Gitcoin across everything we do Capitalize on our strongest brand equities Modernize the look and feel of the brand Drive consistency and reduce complexity  Whether or not we move forward with a brand refresh, rebrand, or something in between is up to us - the main goal is to ensure there is intentionality behind our design elements, and that we feel confident our brand expressions uphold our strategy. Lastly, it\u2019s important to note that our brand is a living and breathing thing, and none of this work is meant to be overly prescriptive - instead, it should feel organically aligned with shifts happening in other areas of the organization as they relate to the ways in which we activate against our mission and vision. Simultaneously, it should also act as a membrane, not as a hard shell. We want to build a brand that feels inviting and inclusive enough for contributors to take it and turn it into something outside our wildest dreams in order to inspire greater affinity and connection across our audiences.  Share your feedback! We welcome all feedback and questions at this stage and invite you to discuss this further during our Gitcoin Community Call (FKA DAO Vibes) takeover on 12/7. ",

Gitcoin\u2019s evolution into a DAO is so strange because it\u2019s so uneven.  It\u2019s like it grew the right leg of a marathon runner and the left leg of a couch potato.    The right arm of a weight lifter and the left arm of a couch potato.  And a core that can\u2019t keep things in sync. In this analogy, the brand evolution is like the marathon runner arm.  But the business model planning (the core) is just so weak.  The product rollout is TBD.  The main navigation of the website makes it impossible to find anything (couch potato arm).  Execution is uneven across the DAO, and a bunch of other initiatives that we\u2019re told \u201care happening, you\u2019d know if you were on the inside, just trust us\u201d but to me from the gov forums they look just like the couch potato arms.

                    "content": " TLDR  In last week\u2019s Gitcoin Community Call, we shared a holistic update on the brand work to date. Be sure to watch it here as it will help bring you up to speed if you haven\u2019t yet read the other gov posts.  The presentation from this session can also be found here.  Why we\u2019re here:  As Gitcoin continues to evolve, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to examine our brand (across different expressions (from visual to verbal to experiential). We\u2019re looking for feedback from the community on the work being done across workstreams and led by MMM So far, there have been two other posts in this series:  An explanation of key definitions like Brand and Brand Strategy then walks through the foundational work leading up to the synthesis of the Brand Strategy, which can be found here. A post soliciting feedback on Brand Vision, Brand Mission and Brand Values, which can be found here. This post aims to gather feedback on our working list of Brand Personality Guardrails and Brand Voice and Tone     Specifically, we\u2019d love feedback on:  List of Personality Traits as a whole: does this feel comprehensive? Are you generally aligned? Each particular Personality Trait: are you conceptually aligned? does it feel right? What word(s) might feel better? Elements of our Brand Voice: are you conceptually aligned? does it feel right? What word(s) might feel better? What could make it even stronger and more ownable? The role of Brand Tone: where do you think we have room to adjust our tone? Where and how should we lean into specific aspects of our voice? And, if you have time, take a look at the new Content Style Guide and feel free to leave comments throughout   Anything else?  Most of the items linked here can be found on the MMM Brand Hub. In addition to discussion and feedback here, we welcome additional discussion feedback on the #mmm-brand channel in Discord as well as the #brand-pod channel which will launch later this week.   Defining our Brand Personality To give added color to our Brand Vision, Mission and Values, and to further aid decisions around visual and verbal expressions, our next step is to define Brand Personality Guardrails.  image1272\u00d7556 101 KB  These give a scale of where we want to play and where we don\u2019t want to play, how far to push something or where to not fall too far over. One thing that\u2019s important to note is that these are our overarching Brand Personality Traits, and that for each protocol, program, product, etc, we may choose to lean into certain ones stronger than others. Additionally, we will be going into further detail around defining additional protocol-specific and program-specific personality traits to further inform the visual and verbal expressions of each. This will be addressed in subsequent posts in this series.  Brand Personality Guardrails:  Knowledgeable not pretentious Relatable not casual Dynamic not brash Intentional not chaotic Generous not overbearing Open not reckless Optimistic not naive Delightful not silly   Defining our Brand Voice & Tone Our Brand Personality Guardrails equally inform our Brand Voice and Tone, which help establish clarity around what we say and how we say it, empowering our Content team and contributors to write and speak about Gitcoin, our programs and protocols with confidence. It is important to note that we celebrate the individual voices across our entire community - and that we intend to highlight those unique voices as much as possible. BUT, there are also many cases where we want to be consistent across certain areas. This particularly pertains to:  Web copy Product copy Certain social media platforms Certain blog posts   Brand Voice  We are plainspoken. We understand the world our community are living in: one muddled by hyperbolic language, upsells, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. Because communities come to Gitcoin to fund their shared needs, we avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion. We are genuine. We understand what it takes to build a Web3 community because we have done and are doing so. That means we relate to the challenges and passions faced by budding collectives and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way. We are translators. Only experts can make what\u2019s difficult look easy, and it\u2019s our job to demystify Web3-speak and actually educate. Our humor is dry. Our sense of humor is straight-faced, subtle, and a touch eccentric. We\u2019re weird but not inappropriate, smart but not snobbish. We prefer winking to shouting. We\u2019re never condescending or exclusive\u2014we always bring our frens in on the joke.   image1400\u00d7562 55.7 KB   Brand Tone Our tone is usually informal, but it\u2019s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you\u2019re writing, consider the reader\u2019s state of mind. Are they relieved to be finished with a campaign? Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly. We can get more casual, more gregarious, and more serious depending on topic and audience. Examples will become clear as we continue to refine program and protocol copy, which will be shared in forthcoming posts.  Content Style Guide The working version of the Content Style Guide can be found here  Looking for additional context? Here\u2019s a quick reminder of how we got here and our objectives of this work After months of foundational work that included reviewing past iterations of our mission and vision, speaking with different community members and thought leaders, surveying stakeholder audiences completed, and coming back together to synthesize, we started to distill key pieces of our Brand Strategy (as a reminder, you can learn more about Brand and Brand Strategy in the last governance post in this series, here.) The Brand Strategy is not meant to be overly prescriptive. Rather, it aims to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction. It also helps to inform design development and decisions. Our intent is to develop a Brand Strategy that builds upon our existing Brand Purpose, creating a cohesive Brand Narrative - giving us more clarity around key strategic elements and considerations that can inform the evolution of our visual identity. In its entirety, the Brand Strategy will define vision, mission, core principles, and strategic approaches for the foreseeable future (until another revision is deemed necessary by the community). The aim is to align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, executing, and evolving towards a shared \u201cNorth Star.\u201d To better understand how we reached the below, and to understand it more comprehensively, visit our Brand Evolution Board as well as the original Brand Attributes Workshop, which kicked off this work. We\u2019ve referenced our community\u2019s past work - including the Other Internet work and the Mission and Vision work  Share your feedback! We welcome all feedback and questions at this stage and look forward to continuing to drive this conversation in public. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for this Alexa - I have less strong opinions here but would like to pull out a few things that I think we could do better as an org:     alexalombardo:  We are translators. Only experts can make what\u2019s difficult look easy, and it\u2019s our job to demystify Web3-speak and actually educate.   I think this is a very important piece to pull out an examine closely as we forward Gitcoin\u2019s mission and hone in on specific partnership verticals and audiences. Are we saying here that we will avoid web3 speak (Metalabel does this extremely well so I do think it\u2019s possible)? How does the mosaic of Gitcoin audiences fit into tone and and voice as we partner with web2 orgs like UNICEF-- what will allow us to be most inclusive? I get that Etherium is a bit of a cult and am wondering if that\u2019s an important to consideration when we make these decisions as well? re: personality I think one think that\u2019s missing for me is \u201cfun\u201d and I\u2019m concerned that this might ultimately impact brand visuals. When I think of the personality guardrails as they relate to visual expression, I get a better sense of how the personality might be represented. Our pops of colour and illustrations are certainly \u201cfun\u201d and definitely distinguish us from other brands\u2026imo they\u2019re also slightly childish so maybe \u201cfun but not childish\u201d might be one to add here. Losing \u201cfun\u201d would definitely be a loss for us as a brand distinguisher and would actually like to inject more fun into Gitcoin across the board (biased bc it\u2019s one of my top life values).

With regard to the web3 speak, this came from a combination of inputs from the content team so I\u2019d love for them to chime in here. I would love for us to be even more prescriptive around this. I also think there is an opportunity to break this out further by audience as we know we speak to both web3 natives/enthusiasts as well as newcomers. Perhaps through the \u201cediting\u201d process of content pieces we can evolve/elaborate on these guidelines. Regarding Fun, think we were aiming to get at this with the Delightful not silly trait. As our visual identity evolves I hope that by looking at these traits side by side with visuals we will all begin to se how they translate and some of the questions or concerns can be addressed throughout that process - e.g., the need to change delightful to something stronger because the visuals aren\u2019t adequately capturing the intent behind the trait ",
