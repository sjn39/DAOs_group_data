Fulfilling all a user\u2019s needs in a one-stop hub with a full spectrum of features and services, and a premium user experience. We are streamlining accessibility and lowering the barrier to entry, to allow for easier adoption globally of DeFi & Web3.   As a decentralized non-custodial wallet, Ethereum transaction fees are one of the larger challenges our users face. We are happy to have integrated support for Optimism, to provide a cheaper and faster Ethereum transaction layer to users, which importantly does not sacrifice on security.   We look to increase adoption and ease of use of Web3 & DApps, through supporting the Optimism ecosystem directly within the Infinity Wallet. Our latest unique feature \u201cBrowser-less DApps\u201d solves some of the hurdles seen today within the space on desktop, while driving awareness and usage of the Optimism ecosystem (\u201cDApps\u201d) and providing a wide range of advantages to both DApps & users alike. Liberating Optimism users from needing to use unintuitive browser extension wallets, which typically lack UX & functionality.   We are an entirely self-funded team with almost a decade of experience within the crypto space, providing free to use infrastructure and wallet ecosystem. As a team our goal is to enhance the user experience and lower the barrier to entry for easier adoption of decentralized finance, DApps and web 3.0 globally. Providing a world-class user experience, a seamless user interface and a wide range of innovative and unique features/services. Making adoption and usage of DeFi and Web3 as easy as possible, of which is widely lacking within the wallet space. Wallets are the core foundation for DeFi & Web3, however today act mainly just as a transaction signing layer, without providing much additional functionality and generally lacking in basic UX. We are actively changing this and working with top projects (DApps, Chains, Tokens and others) in the cryptocurrency, DeFi and Web3 space to find ways to bring further value for all and drive real adoption globally.  IW_SCREENS960\u00d7480 234 KB  How will the OP tokens be distributed?   15% for Optimism awareness/incentives (eg. airdrop to users and rewards for bridging to Optimism) in direct benefit of the Optimism ecosystem. We see this as a great potential opportunity to bring new users to Optimism, which should have a low overlap with other Optimism airdrops since our users did not previously have access to Optimism within the Infinity Wallet. Additionally, due to being a multi chain wallet, it could attract users that may have never looked into or been incentivized to try Optimism before. From Web3 uninitiated Bitcoin holders, to Web3 veterans actively using other chain\u2019s DApps in the wallet;   45% for developers that deploy on Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet to receive a reward, incentivizing additional DApp development on Optimism. We propose to release an article detailing the rewards to be available for Optimism DApp developers, based on their individual platform usage and TVL. With a bonus for DApps that have not yet deployed on Optimism, after their successful deployment;   40% for ongoing Optimism support into new features/services and continued DApp integrations. Thereby directly benefitting Optimism DApps by allowing us to waive our usual fee for Optimism DApp integrations. In addition to working with our partners to provide support for Optimism to be as easy as possible to onboard to, as it is for our other supported chains;   How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? By providing incentives, airdropping and working with Optimism DApp developers, it will bring increased awareness of Optimism to our existing and constant new users, attracting them to explore and use the Optimism ecosystem. While providing a seamless access point to interact with and onboard to Optimism and the ability to discover, as well as improve ease of use of Optimism DApps. Additionally we look to expand support for Optimism and work with our partners, to make it easier than ever for potential users to onboard to the chain (such as one-click cross-chain onboarding to/from OETH and OP) and access all their needs directly within the Infinity Wallet. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? We are looking to directly improve the fundamental use of the Optimism ecosystem and increase its awareness and adoption. This will create lasting exposure and use of Optimism and its DApps long after the incentives are distributed. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? Token distribution period is expected to be around 6-12 months. How much will your project match in co-incentives? We won\u2019t be able to provide co-incentives at the moment, however in the future we look to airdrop a % of our token to Optimism holders.

We welcome everyone to try it for themselves!;   Added provable metrics/evidence of success;   Further elaborated our Optimism alignment;   Provided additional detail on the OP token distribution, including incentives for bridging to Optimism and made clearer how the funds usage is to directly benefit Optimism;   ",

Driving further awareness, usage and adoption of Optimism;   Regarding how incentives for Optimism DApp developers will attract lasting use of Optimism, I think it was mostly explained above, however to explore it a little deeper on both points:   DApp developers that deploy on Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet would receive a reward, incentivizing additional DApp development on Optimism. Additionally as part of this proposal our team would support these Optimism DApps for free in the Infinity Wallet. Providing the Optimism ecosystem with a wide range of benefits and driving further adoption and awareness to users.   As a multi-chain infrastructure project/wallet ecosystem, Infinity Wallet is one of the core elements for usage and access to the crypto ecosystem. As such this makes Infinity Wallet one of the fundamental points for awareness and onboarding to Optimism. With the more features and developments that support Optimism, the more opportunities it can bring to the overall ecosystem, leading to long term adoption.   ",

As with your last comment \u201cWe need a proposal that knocks it out of the ball park and adds real value and users to both parties.\u201d, this is exactly what we are looking to provide to the Optimism ecosystem! I will try to provide some more clarity regarding your comments below. As a multi-chain infrastructure wallet ecosystem, Infinity Wallet is one of the core elements for usage and access to the entire crypto ecosystem. As such this makes Infinity Wallet one of the fundamental points for awareness and onboarding to Optimism. Also, as we look to further develop out features and services we will support Optimism as we do with all chains we actively collaborate with, from BNB, MATIC, ONE and many others, providing constant new value. Along with this, we look to support and collaborate with the Optimism ecosystem to drive further adoption of DApps on Optimism, bringing both real value and usage to the overall Optimism ecosystem. Regarding the lack of initial matching funds, this proposal primarily benefits the Optimism ecosystem, as we seek to provide awareness, usage and overall adoption of Optimism. We are currently working on completing our initial contribution to this proposal in good faith, which is the integration of Optimism in the next Infinity Wallet major release. And will look to see if we can provide an airdrop to Optimism holders in the future as mentioned in the proposal. ",

So the focus of the proposal is entirely on supporting the Optimism ecosystem in the Infinity Wallet, working with Optimism DApps and developers on integrating their projects into the Infinity Wallet, and providing overall exposure, usage and adoption of Optimism. The token usage would be split into the proportions below, which are all targeted on raising awareness and ease of use of the Optimism ecosystem:   20% for Optimism marketing campaigns, which primarily benefit Optimism by distributing the Optimism token to new holders from over 150,000 Infinity Wallet users, via various airdrops and activities;   40% for DApp developers that deploy on Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet to receive a reward, incentivizing additional DApp development on Optimism.   40% for ongoing Optimism support and continued DApp integrations. Thereby directly benefitting Optimism DApps by allowing us to waive our usual fee for Optimism DApp integrations. In addition to working with our partners to provide support for Optimism to be as easy as possible to onboard to, as it is for our other supported chains;   As a multi-chain infrastructure project / wallet ecosystem, Infinity Wallet is one of the core elements for usage and access to the crypto ecosystem. As such this makes Infinity Wallet one of the fundamental points for the potential awareness, onboarding and usage of Optimism as detailed in this proposal. ",

Each user can have multiple wallets/addresses across multiple chains. 3- The proposal address has been provided publicly, allowing all to see the recipients of any airdrops or integration rewards. Every Optimism DApp integrated will be publicly announced to bring additional awareness, and allowing anyone to follow the progress. 4- I am not quite sure what you mean by wallet volume, however there is over $400,000,000 held by users as of May.

Obviously, I can check the address as its public and see where its going but from your proposal,   40% for Optimism DApp developers who build on Optimism and integrate with Infinity Wallet; 40% for ongoing development support of Optimism into new features/services and continued DApp integrations;   Those 80% will not be distributed daily, those will be given out to App integration and Dev which will be monthly or fortnight event, second even if the data is there on the chain, how would i know which is going to dev/airdrop/integration. I am not asking you to document distribution of rewards(20% Optimism marketing campaigns) as its too much of work but I do believe documentation rest 80% is quite easy and wont take much of your time. Again, this is not requirement from OP gov, this is from my side and I respect your decision if you decline this. Overall a good proposal. ",

Let say, for discussion, you are giving 1000, 5000 and 7000OP from integration funding to three project A. B and C, now on-chain i see those transaction but how would i know which address belong to A, B and C. I think integration and dev distribution would be easy to track as i dont see number of integration going beyond 100 during first quarter, which means you need to maintain a record of only 100 transaction. i know its an added work but i would recommend you do, if you are not planning on making this public, nonetheless. For airdrop, I wont recommend doing so as there number of transaction might go beyond 100K. Again, just a suggestion and its up to you, I will bring this to OP Team so that may we can make this mandatory from next phase. I read that they are planning to do chain analysis on all the passed proposal, to see where the funds are going, from their side but I am not how detailed it would be and if they will make this public or not.

MM is not made for general users it has no focus on UX, really bad UI, lacks any functionality. I was recommending it the past year to friends because it was really the only solution on the market that I knew of at the time, but many people I was getting into crypto had major issues using it.

Once we launch Infinity Wallet Mobile we expect to grow and onboard a much larger userbase. As for a Dune dashboard, Infinity Wallet is an EOA wallet without a specific contract used, so there is no way for Dune to track data of the Infinity Wallet. You could check our website traffic, which although is not proof of users, may give you a general idea.

I think he wanted their inside information which realistically no platform is ever going to share their full metrics public due to possible competitors, private information or even company policies. They provided the general stats all platforms should be required to provide which some have not and I am actually surprised they provided him with additional information as it was a far reach from him! This is another reason why there needs to be a oversight committee to improve voting/governance on proposals, since delegators can essentially force projects into providing inside information and if they dont provide then be threatened with a NO. Some delegators might be competitors to these projects or support another project and only after the inside information. Example @tongnk on the PERP proposal for 9,000,000 OP was asked to provide additional information/metrics and never did! I am guessing most likely due to the same reasons I commented above why most projects will be reluctant to provide additional metrics publicly! ",

You are correct that the market is crowded with wallets on Mobile and even Browser Extensions, but Infinity Wallet is a Desktop wallet and there is not many of them. In fact I believe it\u2019s the only wallet I know of it\u2019s kind on Desktop, which is providing full access to web3 directly within the wallet, along with many other unique things they have. The current wallet market for mobile and browser extensions is saturated mainly because the majority of wallets are just all the same thing cloning each other with little innovation, with most lacking in nearly everything, providing a terrible user experience, unprofessional and old user interfaces, lacking in providing a variety of services and literally no user support. If you look at the market and search for quality wallets you will be lucky if you can find more than 5 wallets at best. Yes the market for mobile and browser extensions may be crowded, but the problem is that it\u2019s with a lot of low quality projects that won\u2019t be around for the long term. It\u2019s the exact same issue with DeFi where majority of projects are just cloning each other. This market needs to focus more on funding the projects that are driving innovation and providing quality for long term mass adoption of the space. This is why I love using the Infinity Wallet, their team has a clear focus on the long term to drive adoption and is always bringing new developments. They provide a range of unique services, one of the best user interfaces in the market and provide the best user experience. Also they are the only platform I know that has live support on a decentralized wallet and they have helped me on a couple of occasions. Live support in the Defi space will make a massive difference on the overall user experience and make users more comfortable in using Defi or entering the space. Note: When I contacted their live support it was related to some DApps I was trying to use via their wallet, because the DApps didn\u2019t have support of their own I contacted the Infinity Wallet live support and they were very helpful in providing support for a platform they didn\u2019t even operate. At the moment I am currently using Trust Wallet on mobile and Infinity Wallet on Desktop. I am really looking forward to when they release mobile so I can switch over to something far better, from the sneak peaks they shared a while back it looked to be one of the best designed mobile platforms I have seen in the fintech and crypto space.

Top Wallets can definitely help with that. We are not fully convinced that Infinity Wallet can add significant value based on this proposal & the market share. We are not very supportive of funding internal development or an airdrop - as that does not help growing the Optimism ecosystem in the long-term but might rather have negative consequences.

The proposals differ significantly in quality and value for the Op ecosystem:   Paraswap is a top 3 DEX Aggregator. Infinity Wallet is not a top 10 Wallet.   Paraswap shows high long-term alignment with Optimism (Permanent liquidity, etc.). IW not to the same degree.   IW uses 55% of funds for low-value airdrop & internal integrations. Paraswap incentivizes with 65% others to also build on Optimism, integrate Paraswap Optimism integrations.   Paraswap:  50% $OP will be distributed to new dApp and app developers that integrate ParaSwap into their swaps and interact directly with the Optimism ecosystem. If any particular type of dApp is preferred, we can work with the OP governance to further decide what kinds of apps receive a certain amount of the allocations. 35% of $OP will be used to establish permanent, protocol-owned liquidity on Optimism. This would lead to no dumping of $OP onto the market compared to liquidity mining rewards. 15% $OP will be distributed to successful DexLib integrations in the Optimism ecosystem. We will provide a flat reward for any integration, followed by a bonus depending on success metrics.  IW:  15% for Optimism marketing campaign (Airdrop to 150,000+ users, rewards for completing activities and other marketing initiatives to drive awareness and adoption); 45% for developers that deploy on Optimism and work with Infinity Wallet to receive a reward, incentivizing additional DApp development on Optimism; 40% for ongoing Optimism support into new features/services and continued DApp integrations. Thereby directly benefitting Optimism DApps by allowing us to waive our usual fee for Optimism DApp integrations. In addition to working with our partners to provide support for Optimism to be as easy as possible to onboard to, as it is for our other supported chains;  ",

Access to Optimism and DApps on desktop is currently restrained to unintuitive browser extension wallets. We look to change that by integrating Optimism into the Infinity Wallet to provide an enhanced Web3 experience, enabling access for all users regardless of their technical ability. Our proposal is focused around both short, and sustainable long term adoption of Optimism. In the short term:   In addition to the upcoming initial Optimism support within Infinity Wallet, we look to introduce Optimism to our users through various airdrops/events. We see this as a great potential opportunity to bring new users to Optimism, which should have a low overlap with other Optimism airdrops since our users did not previously have access to Optimism within the Infinity Wallet. Additionally, due to being a multi chain wallet, it could attract users that may have never looked into or been incentivized to try Optimism before. From Web3 uninitiated Bitcoin holders, to Web3 veterans actively using other chain\u2019s DApps in the wallet.   In regard to potential negative consequences you mention, to be able to sell the airdropped OP tokens would require Optimistic Ethereum as gas. Bridging ETH to and from Optimism could consume most or all of any potential profit from the small airdropped amount, and would currently require some research on how to acquire it (Although we do look to make onboarding ETH to Optimism for gas much easier from within the wallet in the future). Once a user has onboarded to Optimism, we believe it would be much more likely that they would stick around to see the benefits on offer (especially as we hope to provide them with a rich selection of Optimism DApps to discover and connect with as part of this proposal).   In the long term:   Long term is the main focus of the proposal. To attract further DApp development on Optimism, and to support them as part of a rich selection of Optimism DApps for users to easily discover and use, from within a user focused all-in-one platform.   We see this as sustainable long after the incentives have been distributed, as we look to create real value. Laying the foundation for user focused DApp usage on Optimism. With a large proportion of any DApps deployed expected to remain on Optimism indefinitely.   Regarding alignment, as a multi-chain wallet ecosystem with a strong focus on ease of Web3 adoption, we are absolutely aligned to support Optimism and leverage its benefits for the years to come. With the more DApps and developers we support on Optimism, the more features and services that support Optimism, the more opportunities it can bring to the overall ecosystem, leading to lasting long term adoption.

I hope to see your support for Optimism - no matter the outcome of the vote. And, If you aren\u2019t successful this time, we would be happy to see another proposal with a slightly higher focus on user onboarding to Optimism, co-incentives and a bit more detail, i.e. a more specific breakdown of use and distribution of funds, for example (as you briefly touched on) incentivizing users to bridge to Op and provide long-term liquidity to key trading pairs through the Infinity Wallet, or incentivizing the use of unique Op apps such as DCAing into tokens by subsidizing the costs (ofc while avoiding that users game the incentives/system). Overall, as stated before, we are not very supportive of funding internal development of ventures. Also, we tend to be sceptic of metrics that we can not doublecheck ourselves but we\u2019re very much looking forward to your Optimism support and to specific Op adoption/growth KPIs - if you can share them with us.

People who know me and my work know how much I appreciate local apps and dislike the browser-based webapps that have become the standard laely. Interesting UI. I downloaded and tried the wallet before making a decision. Cons The main reason I vote NO is that this is a closed source product. I tried to find the source code of the product and could not find any references to opensource or anything in Github. I may be mistaken here, so please correct me if I am wrong but it seems this is a closed source product. Then the ask amount is big. half a million OP tokens at the current price is $262,000. This is going to be split between marketing and development of a closed source product which I think is really not what should be in the scope of these funding rounds. ",

The focus of this proposal is the direct expansion of the Optimism ecosystem and not development of the Infinity Wallet, of which we are actually integrating Optimism support for free outside of this proposal. The main recipient of the funds would be DApp developers that deploy on Optimism. Which we propose to further boost the proliferation of Optimism DApps by waiving our integration fee for integrating them into the Infinity Wallet. Additionally the marketing/airdrop portion is primarily for additional Optimism awareness, helping to introduce the Optimism ecosystem to our 150,000+ users. Thanks ",

Today I checked out your wallet and I have to say it\u2019s superb! The main thing that stands out is the quality and that you provide a more curated experience, also you are not a browser extension wallet  I have been saying for a while this space needed a intuitive wallet solution on desktop to access web3, something that could bring a higher focus on quality (UX/UI) and provide a more curated experience, to actually allow for easier adoption. Because browser extension wallets like MetaMask and other extension wallets are really bad, they are not made for mass usage due to terrible UX/UI and are time consuming to use or know where to start, also they don\u2019t feel natural to use or secure. You guys have quite a few nice features, but my favourite feature is your web3 browser. It makes the use and UX of web3 100x easier.  image_2022-07-05_2316531641918\u00d71077 134 KB  I really like how you have kept the UI very intuitive, the biggest thing for me is that it feels natural to use rather then when using a browser extension. It actually feels like how web3 should be if that makes sense in terms of UX, I applaud you guys on doing such a great job.  image_2022-07-05_2317278421920\u00d71077 123 KB  I like how you can click the arrow in the top right to hide the side bar and wallets (even changing a wallet or chain is way more easier then anything used before ). The only thing I would like to suggest is when pressing f11 it should hide the top bar, at the moment it just grows the screen.  image_2022-07-06_0022389671909\u00d71072 100 KB  I was wondering, does the blue badge have some use other than to say a dapp is integrated?

There is a clear issue of delegates not researching, showing a lack of understanding or simply not asking questions before voting, leading many to vote based on an incomplete or assumed basis. As an example I will point out on this project alone some cases:   Quixotic reason \u201cProposal K: Infinity Wallet - No, we\u2019d like to the Optimism integration happen first.\u201d - Their decision was to vote NO because they thought this project didn\u2019t support OP when it does. I actually downloaded the wallet to try it a few days back and it does support OP. An example of not asking questions, reviewing correctly and presuming.   lefterisjp - He has a direct conflict of interest with this project as his project is similar to it in terms of what it offers (Portfolio Dashboard, Transactions, NFTs, Stats and etc\u2026). This is why his decision to put NO is biased, then to add on top they replied to him and he ignored their reply which defunct his own comment.   In this project alone if you changed Quixotic which voted based on wrong information and lefterisjp if he done the correct thing and abstained, then this project would be 9.5 million YES to 2.4 million NO. This is just based on 1 delegate presuming and another having a conflict of interest. My point is that many delegates have based their decisions off of presuming, showing a clear lack of reviewing proposals or asking projects questions. The other issue is that there are far to many projects applying and its only going to grow, leading to even more of these issues. There needs to be a committee in place to decide on proposals that are ready and also there needs to be rules set out which can be enforced to ensure delegates are kept to standards. ",

We are the first platform of our kind on Desktop to provide access to the world of DeFi and Web3, with the majority of our users coming over from Web3 browser extension wallets and loving our much more user friendly experience. Regarding provable metrics/evidence of Infinity Wallets success, please see the following:  120,000+ monthly website visits (infinitywallet.io Traffic Analytics & Market Share | Similarweb) 18 chains supported (including Optimism) BNB MVB IV selected project, and tweeted about multiple times by Binance and BNBChain twitter accounts (https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1524199862702551040 and https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1514270664978575365); Top 10 voted project on KCC (https://twitter.com/KCCOfficialTW/status/1525152270278483968) Supported as a top desktop connection option on Wallet Connect Working with many top DApps across multiple chains regarding direct integration into our browser-less DApps (latest integration being Venus https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1542234775917940739)  Regarding not being open source, this is quite normal for premium platforms focusing on innovation and user experience. Being open source is far from a guarantee that the platform is safe to use, and comes with additional problems such as enabling cloning and phishing, working against our goal to provide the most user friendly and safe environment for all kinds of users. Additionally I don\u2019t think this would be a disadvantage to our proposal as we have already integrated Optimism support and are not asking for funds for development, but to grow the Optimism ecosystem with additional awareness and providing rewards to developers that build on optimism and integrate with us.

Also this proposal is not about supporting the Infinity Wallet but about supporting the growth of the Optimism ecosystem in line with the Optimistic vision. Restricting Optimisms avenues of growth based on arbitrary preferences, rather than judging each individual proposal based on its prospect for growing the ecosystem could be seen as counter to this goal. Open-source, closed-source or partially open-source really should have no effect since the proposal is not to fund our development. ",

A little strange don\u2019t you think when other delegates are mentioning your name related to issues of conflict of interest across a couple of projects! You are saying this project is not a conflict to you, but many features are the same or similar across you both. You may not be a direct competitor to them because your not a wallet, but offering similar features is still a conflict of interest. The other issue is you attitude which from following the chat has been completely different in the way you interacted with them compared to other projects. Also @lefterisjp I have not even delegated to you, you need to not guess and base on facts or ask me first before stating something. I am a delegate to my self and several others that delegate to me.     lefterisjp:  you have a combative attitude if the counterpart of the conversation does not agree with you   Also for this to be true you would of first of had to reply to me and since I have never even mentioned this to you before then it makes what you stated hard to be true. There is no need to be aggressive or attack projects, delegates or anyone else here, we are all in here for the common success of Optimism and I hope everyone can point out weaknesses to each other so we can all improve together as a collective.
