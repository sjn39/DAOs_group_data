                    "content": "In 2021, RWF CU was underutilizing the budget and left a significant part in the DSSVest. On December 4th, a strong wave of liquidation triggered a huge slippage on flap auction (up to 25%) so mandated actors were suggested to withdraw funds to avoid more \u201cbad flap\u201d which I did. Those funds being in excess I could have waited to send them back later or sterilized them by buying MKR (~100 MKR). I did the latter and converted those DAI at a much better rate than all-around flap auctions. In retrospect, I should probably have done nothing.  image886\u00d7246 24.5 KB  The main transaction is here. The full RWF Wallet ledger is here. The options are to convert those MKR back to DAI and send them to the Surplus Buffer which would incur a 5% slippage on burning MKR (through flapper that will be activated right after) or send them to DSPauseProxy with the MKR from the Foundation for future use (or burning) by the DAO. The latter makes more sense but I\u2019m fine both ways. There is more than 1.5 months of budget in the DSS Vest and the RWF wallet What do you want?     convert to DAI send to DSPauseProxy     0 voters     ",

I believe the timing of the conversion here is the key question. If I had to opinionate on the matter, I\u2019d rather have the MKR sent back to treasury and burnt prior to any fund transfer between the current mutlisig and a new one setup for the CU. If voting is confirmed, I do not plan to have anything other than DAI in the multisig from day 0. ",
