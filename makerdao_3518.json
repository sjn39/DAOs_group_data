Wrap the topic link around the entire list item in the topic list Move the avatar on the single post to within the post body   Request for feedback Is having the category list side-by-side with the latest posts on the landing page the desired layout?     categories list split with latest posts (current) categories list and latest posts separate (proposed) something else     0 voters     Would love to hear any other thoughts you might have or feel free to open an issue on the repo. Thanks   Potential updates There\u2019s a series of plug-ins that can be used to enhance the theme even more that haven\u2019t been added directly to this iteration. They can be included in a future iteration, but have been excluded in this scope:   Trust Level on Avatars - indicates admin assigned trust level on avatars  Custom links in menu - dai and voting portal, makerdao.com, etc from menu  Switcher Component - allow users to select their theme  Alternative Logo - alternative logo for dark theme  Footer - additional links to lower priority resources  Formatting toolbar - Expands post/reply formatting options  Category banners - Add banners to enrich category post lists  Author Badges - Allows badges to be displayed beside a posters name  Mute Thread button - Adds a quick button to unsubscribe from threads  Linkify words in post - Makes designated words in posts automatic links (to resources, etc.)  Change the Like icon - Can change the \u2018like\u2019  to any other font-awesome glyph e.g.     Technical Setup If you\u2019re technically inclined and would like the full experience, the setup for testing is fairly straightforward:  Create account on Discourse Theme Creator  Clone working repo - LFW MakerDAO Discourse Theme (pending pull) | Feedback update  Install Discourse CLI - Meta Thread On Mac, if you have Ruby 2.2+ (default on 10.13.3)  installed: $ gem install discourse_theme  From the cloned theme directory: $ discourse_theme watch .
