Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.\n\n### Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/mEDvFXGCKdDhR-N320KRtsq60Y2OPk8rHcHBCFVryXY)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [PG twitter account](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild)\n\n### Context\n\n1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn\u2019t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn\u2019t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren\u2019t the only or best motivator for people, it\u2019s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.\n2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.\n3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.\n\nHere\u2019s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).\n\nIf we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - \u201cEthereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games\u201d; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))\n\n### What is the Protocol Guild?\n\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:\n\n* current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6-guidelines-for-regular-operation.html#weighting)\n* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure\n* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust\n\nTo date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.\n\nThe Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html) have more information.\n\n \n![0xsplits horizontal.png](ipfs://QmdpmizBcNGuVV5FZR4zLUz3wsYTTdfNpVZsywMC7Utpdo)\n    \n\n### PG Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we\u2019ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we\u2019re ready to test the mechanism\u2019s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016/1), and the [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b) ([forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/50)) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days.\n\nThe funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild\u2019s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022](https://openorgs.info/)), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:\n\n* Uniswap\u2019s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth\n  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework.\n* Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap community\u2019s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this Temp Check Snapshot vote has a positive outcome, we will move to a consensus check, and then an onchain vote.",

                    "content": "Authors: Trent (PG Member), Tim (PG Member)  Abstract This is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors. We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot. Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.  Useful links  Protocol Guild Docs 1 Year Vesting Contract Initial Announcement - Dec 2021 List of Members   Context  As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn\u2019t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn\u2019t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren\u2019t the only or best motivator for people, it\u2019s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.  Here\u2019s a longer exploration of the project rationale. If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - \u201cEthereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games\u201d; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. (Griffith, 2019)  What is the Protocol Guild? The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:  current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting  current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust  To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list here). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract. The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the docs have more information.  0xsplits horizontal3144\u00d72024 413 KB   PG Pilot Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we\u2019ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we\u2019re ready to test the mechanism\u2019s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute 2,000,000 LDO. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the Pilot vesting contract here. Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.  Proposal We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild\u2019s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ($1.2b as of May 16, 2022), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot. There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:  Uniswap\u2019s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:   The Merge: moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like EOF   Statelessness: sustainable management for state growth Supporting L2 scaling: EIP-4844, EIP-4488   Proposer Builder Separation: reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades   Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework. Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap community\u2019s existing reputation for funding Public Goods. Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.   Next Steps Discussion on this forum post - we\u2019re very interested in feedback on how to adapt this to best fit the goals of the Uniswap community. ",

It\u2019s just forced annoyance that is becoming too commonplace where it doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense. Somewhat related: The Uniswap community needs to see items like this as mechanisms to support the fee switch. Value accrual to UNI via fees, which will largely be ETH denominated, can then be used for contributions like this - better aligning incentives by paying in ETH. Would also make it such that the fees are not purely value extractive from LPs, as it goes to broader contributions like this. ",

I think the \u201cdeliverable\u201d you can expect is that client developers and researchers keep focusing on having Ethereum be the best base layer possible for Uniswap and other applications.     BOR4:   1 year isn\u2019t really vesting it is more EOY bonus    Agreed 1Y isn\u2019t a huge vesting period. That said, we do want to start with a shorter trial  because the Guild is new and we want to dry-run things like adding/removing folks, testing smart contract infrastructure, etc. over a long-but-not-super-long period. Hopefully that informs a V2 version of PG which can target longer duration (and hopefully larger/recurring) donations.     klinko:  No vesting - what\u2019s the point of forcing UNI to be held for something like this?

It\u2019s just forced annoyance that is becoming too commonplace where it doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense.   I think this also goes back to trialing the mechanism: if the next iteration of the Guild had, say, 4Y vesting, we want to make sure the process works as expected with just a 1Y vest. Similarly, a vesting structure allows PG to get the funds from DAOs up front rather than, say, coming back every N months with another governance proposal.     yitong:  However, I\u2019d love to see what detail on what Protocol Guild expects to accomplish using this grant.

As for \u201cwhat will members of the guild deliver\u201d, I\u2019ll repeat myself from above:  I think the \u201cdeliverable\u201d you can expect is that client developers and researchers keep focusing on having Ethereum be the best base layer possible for Uniswap and other applications.

I think a quicker conversion to either ETH or stables - or a mix - would still be fair, with then PG handling distribution over those 4 years. Perhaps a minor nuance but volatility should ideally be minimized while also targeting upside incentives, say via a 50/50 ETH & USD split.

We want PG to be around as long as it\u2019s producing useful outcomes for the Ethereum protocol: a key part of that process is actively listening for and digesting feedback inputs. We\u2019ve started with the collective perspective that this first Pilot design will need some tuning. This can be related to a changing external context: eg. should vesting timelines take broader market dynamics into account? Or internal to the mechanism: what ways have we misunderstood the effects of incentives, what do sponsors need, how should members better curate? In the near term, we have adopted an active stance of continuous adjustments to improve PG while we move deeper into the Pilot: improving documentation, resources for members, and better transparency. Longer term, we\u2019ve committed to publicly evaluating Pilot outcomes here. These prompts will be updated over time as we start to hear back from participants - both members and sponsors. We\u2019re happy to take additional suggestions for what to track! Our learnings will be published and incorporated into PG before the launch of the next iteration of the project. Thanks for the support, we are honored by the thoughtful consideration the Uniswap community has given us so far  ",

                    "content": "Blockchain@Columbia voted yes to the recent temperature check for the Protocol Guild Pilot Program.  We think it\u2019s a significant initiative, and, as it 's a pilot, we wanted to offer further discussion from our Uniswap Protocol lead @jason_of_cs. Looking forward to any commentary! We believe that the PG proposal offers the potential to support \u2013and further incentivize\u2013 essential Public Goods\u2019 development, in the form of providing funding for the base protocol development of Ethereum. In this regard, and particularly due to the apparent reduction of the upside intertwined with the decreasing block reward, economically incentivizing the development of the core Ethereum development in a decentralized way is a particularly good idea. We would, however, like to emphasize that some further thought into the funding methodology for that purpose is necessary; in particular, we think that providing Protocol Guild with a diversified portfolio of application-layer assets \u2013and more so, specifically used for governance\u2013 might not be the right way to fund such an initiative in the long term. First, having a diverse pool of governance tokens from more than some very small number of protocols may denigrate the quality of governance on those individual protocols (of which Uniswap is the example in point) since any one single contributor cannot possibly keep track of and meaningfully participate in a lot of governance forums at once. The meaning of providing governance tokens is exactly to primarily exercise governance (and not to be utilized as a financial incentive), therefore we think that there is little point to providing a diversified pool of governance tokens. Secondly, with a diversified pool providing upside to \u201ca lot of\u201d application-level assets, it may be the case that the provided upside is too much of a financial incentive in the long run; the parallel drawn to the financial motives being higher to contribute in an application-layer project is countered by the fact that it is objectively not possible to join/contribute to, say, 10 projects at the same time: one has to choose at most 1-2 desirable projects. At the same time, with a diversified pool providing diversified access to application-layer protocols, it is possible to get significant upside on all/most/many of them, something that as shown above, would be impossible to get through dev contribution alone. Thus, it is a realistic long-term risk that having more than a handful of application-layer sponsors participating on PG would over-incentivize; and one of the core reasons that someone might imagine this being undesirable is that it is reasonable to assume that some large percentage of the innovation for which economic upside on application-layer development is provided for (say, 75%? more? quantifying this is not really the point) is specific to application-layer innovation, and does not have to do in any \u2013indirect, of course\u2013 way with the core/base development that we are trying to incentivize. All in all, we would really like the protocol\u2019s participants, the application-layer sponsors, and other involved actors to carefully deliberate the related points further, since it is of significance to the long-term success of this greatly beneficial for the community initiative.

Stopping by to provide a quick update on the Protocol Guild, a new public goods funding mechanism that was launched with your backing, as we\u2019re currently 6 months into our 1-year pilot. In case you need a reminder, the Protocol Guild aims to enable a decentralized and sustainable funding mechanism for Ethereum\u2019s core protocol development. It creates an easy and effective way for anyone to donate funds to a single address, which gets vested over time to active core protocol contributors. Over the long term we hope to see Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and community band together to normalize donating a portion of treasuries / revenues to this mechanism, to secure the future of Ethereum\u2019s core development work. Uniswap was a trailblazer in this regard, generously donating 500k UNI tokens, worth $2.7m a the time, back in July. Thank you again for your support! Here\u2019s where we\u2019re at since launching:  $10 million raised to date from 3.8k donations (185 unique donors) $5m has been distributed to 128 members (up from 90 to start), on average $39k per member Work is currently underway for the Guild to adopt Moloch v3 tooling and allow consolidation of L2 donations Our next fundraising push will target raising $100m over four years, from the end of the pilot (May \u201823)  I\u2019ve shared a few links below if you\u2019d like to read more about this, and of course happy to also field any questions here - wishing everyone a happy holidays  Mid-pilot update Mid-pilot update Tweet thread  Tim\u2019s recap see section \u201cProtocol Guild Update\u201d Member list Documentation  ",
