I have been trying to get help for this situation for 2 weeks now from others but been struggling to get help. Basically, I accidentally sent $35k DAI to the MATIC contract address instead of my MetaMask address. I understand these mistakes are not reversible, but given how big the amount is, I understand that Maker governs DAI. I understand that this would need to pass through governance, but I can see DAI has a mint and burn function; so I was wondering if this error is possible to be returned to me. I will copy the code function mint(address usr, uint wad) external auth {     balanceOf[usr] = add(balanceOf[usr], wad);     totalSupply    = add(totalSupply, wad);     emit Transfer(address(0), usr, wad); } function burn(address usr, uint wad) external {     require(balanceOf[usr] >= wad, \"Dai/insufficient-balance\");     if (usr != msg.sender && allowance[usr][msg.sender] != uint(-1)) {         require(allowance[usr][msg.sender] >= wad, \"Dai/insufficient-allowance\");         allowance[usr][msg.sender] = sub(allowance[usr][msg.sender], wad);     }     balanceOf[usr] = sub(balanceOf[usr], wad);     totalSupply    = sub(totalSupply, wad);     emit Transfer(usr, address(0), wad); }  Can some admin help me out here and let me know if governance can approve this and thus burn the tokens from the matic contract address and mint them back in my wallet. Thank you so much for your time; feel free to contact me here or reply to the thread.  Tariq  ",

However, as you can see from Dai contract itself, there are several that sent large amounts of Dai to Dai contract and there\u2019s no way to help them at the moment as the protocol can\u2019t just mint additional Dai at will. However, maybe it\u2019s possible for you to submit a formal governance proposal to mint additional. Thank you ",

Returning ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the DAI contract Miscellaneous       Hello everyone,  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right place for it, but I\u2019m taking a chance. Despite several years of daily use of ERC20 tokens, I unfortunately managed to make a mistake and send  some ERC20 tokens  to the DAI contract instead on another wallet. Here is the DAI contract address : 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F  Could you please tell me if there is a way to get those ERC20 tokens back?

My impression is that there is no strong objection to refunding lost DAIs, but it\u2019s difficult to delimit the boundaries of several different cases. In this specific case (sending DAIs to the DAI address), I think that:  If some whale user did send 500m by mistake to the DAI-address, we\u2019d probably intervene to refund them. This is because 500m DAI lost would have a negative effect on the peg (despite what @SebVentures correctly said in one of the thread cited above about the role of the PSM in this). So it seems fair to intervene also for non-whales. There is little controversy in this specific situation (e.g., \u201cwhat if these DAI\u2019s are not really lost, etc\u201d) since there are no 3rd parties involved here.  For the above reasons I think there is space for trying to push this refund process forward. @tariq.haji my suggestion to you is to enter the MakerDAO chat, and ask around for guidelines on how to make a forum poll/proposal. In that proposal you should try to advocate that it is a good idea to develop the tools to revert transactions that sent DAIs to the DAI-address. Keep in mind that, since this will likely involve some smart-contract development/assistance, this might take months. ",
