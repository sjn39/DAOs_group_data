See https://sleepy-williams-401b9e.netlify.com/ I was the one that made a website for Berlin Council, and I think making a whole website is overkill. I replicated the whole website in one page here https://sleepy-williams-401b9e.netlify.com/events/2018-council-of-berlin/ It\u2019s a standard Jekyll site, so people would do pull requests with new events, or file an issue if they aren\u2019t comfortable with Github and volunteers would do it. I\u2019ve put this into a Github issue https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues/15 to track progress, but am posting here for broader discussion. The data is incomplete / placeholder as I needed some content to work with. I am happy to take pull requests in the repo here https://github.com/bmann/ethereum-events for now. This should be very simple even for non-technical users \u2013 you can edit files directly through Github, and then make a PR (Github will prompt you to make a \u201cfork\u201d which will then be in your own account). I am happy to help support someone trying this out so we can improve documentation on how to do this. And of course: design assistance welcome! Edit \u2013 some additional thoughts: I was inspired by nodeschool, which has each chapter add a little json file https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io/tree/source/chapters Since I used jekyll, the basic pattern of just adding a post for an event seemed appropriate. Back in the day, Barcamp exploded around the world by having a Barcamp Wiki where people copied, cloned, and remixed content. So I hope this will help event organizers come up with templates and patterns. I\u2019m sticking this in Site Feedback as the EthMagicians \u201cmeta\u201d category \u2013 suggesting we use it as the general category for FEM community process. ",

I am not asking about design elements itself. I have asked about its reason and usage. For example, there could be a EA-logo designed to be used by Ethereum Architects on their visitcards or sites. It could have a good marketing and self-identification value. It will make a membership more attractive. The EA-logo should be derived from main FEM logo, but distinguishable from other FEM-Rings logos if there will be any. possibly you have more ideas like that? We need this for job description for designer if we will hire him. ",

Given that I work on Ethsignals I don\u2019t want to show support for EIPS outside of the scope of tech needed for signaling. I also feel that one role Ethsignals has is to be a tool to help Ethereum Magicians and so there is a good intersection there. I am happy to help out anywhere that I can also remain independent from a Ring, or showing direct or indirect support for specific EIPs. Helping Rings get set up and running when there has been a request for them and meta-governance with the forum, are some things I have thought. Let me know where you and @jpitts could use a helping mouse and keyboard.  ",
