Combined China, Eu, Russia, and countries in the middle east have all began to move away from the dollar as the world reserve and are adopting others. While the dollar has a long history of being the world\u2019s standard which is why many companies like MakerDao adopt it, the truth is that history cannot always tell us about the future. Many other currencies are appreciating against the dollar and have been for some time now, and with even more stimulus talks on the way this can only accelerate the process of the dethroning of the dollar as world reserve currency. However, I do not believe that Dai should just jump to the next major currency like the euro or yuan if it hopes to be a truly global currency. The UN has been alluding to a currency based on an index of many major world currencies. For example, in such an index if a single countries currency depreciates due to excessive printing, then it will be offset by others appreciating thus evening out the index. If Dai were to create or track an index of many major currencies instead of just the dollar, then it would greatly add to the reliability and stability of the coin. Trust would be much stronger thus making adoption easier. TLDR: A global coin should track an index of all currencies. This would greatly aid in stability, reliability, trust, and adoption of the coin. ",

                    "content": "I agree with the thought of moving away from the dollar in the long run. For faster adoption at present, though, it is necessary to keep the dollar-pegged DAI and start creating DAI versions pegged to other major currencies. We see Central Banks scrambling to catch up. Right now they say CBDC will exist alongside cash and existing electronic money, but I do not think it will take very long before some CBs will claim a sovereign monopoly to the issuance of money, prohibiting anything backed by or pegged to the sovereign fiat currency. So it would definitely be prudent for the Maker community to start thinking about this scenario. A gold-backed token sounds interesting, but has the disadvantage of being \u201ccentralised\u201d due to storage and therefore being seizable by authorities. This risk could be mitigated somewhat by choosing a solid jurisdiction (e.g. Switzerland). I think BTC can be a contender too. If it proves to have a value behaviour similar to gold and it enjoys a high level of trust by the people of the world (yes, fiat in Latin), its decentralised nature and capped issuance can bring it a long way to pick up this role.

For example, Terra used to promote Terra SDT, which was pegged to IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDR). However, there\u2019s not much usage and demand. So they instead started to focus on Terra stablecoins that are pegged to KRW and USD. Other stablecoins that are pegged to SDR like Xank, MILE, and etc also faced similar issues. But if there are stablecoins that are pegged to SDR that are doing well, I am happy to learn about them. ",

The greenback system is real and isn\u2019t going anywhere in the near term. While everybody fears \u201cbrrrrr\u201d will devalue the dollar, it\u2019s important to ask if it\u2019ll be devalued in relation to other currencies. Historically, democratic controlled white houses have been VERY correlated with the DXY getting stronger. So it\u2019s not a given that a weaker dollar is in the future. But the SDR basket has merit. If Maker decides to implement something similar, it might make sense to do it as a second debt backed currency, with some originality that takes into consideration \u201cthe new financial economy\u201d by including BTC and Gold.
