                    "content": " Introducing the Legal and Transaction Services Core Unit The Maker community wants to scale the onboarding of real-world assets into Maker vaults to launch the protocol towards its higher potential. MakerDAO requires independent, high-quality, innovative, and results-oriented legal and transaction management skills to achieve that objective at any speed. During March 18th\u2019s SES Weekly Status Update Call, Christian Petersen @christiancdpetersen introduced a solution for this skills gap: the Legal & Transaction Services Core Unit (LTS-001).  Mission This Core Unit aims to establish and maintain an independent network of legal professionals to support MakerDAO\u2019s Core Units engaged in real-world financing transactions or investments. Core Units engaging in work with RWAs and structured finance will share everyday complexities involving agreements with counterparties, structured finance terms, project finance terms, physical assets, diverse jurisdictions, and regulations (to name a few).  Service Focused Don\u2019t lawyers just block work from getting done? No, experienced and high-quality transaction lawyers facilitate the deal getting done. These skills are a fundamental prerequisite for the on-boarding of real-world assets for any asset type, from any jurisdiction, and through any strategic model. In real-world financings, transaction lawyers:  Identify and find solutions with commercial, risk, and technical teams to mitigate various commercial, legal, technical and other risks. Drive and manage deals towards closure. Communicate with relevant stakeholders. Manage and supervise external counsel. Generally, support the financing process.   1600\u00d7579 155 KB  LTS Lawyers will have similar roles for support opportunities that come to the DAO:  Undertake transaction due diligence involving the legal structure of entities, counterparties, and fiat/Dai flows. Legal research of applicable law requirements and obtain local counsel advice as needed. Negotiate commercial and legal positions, implementing the DAO\u2019s legal risk appetite. Review borrower-provided lending documents, supporting the process through closing and disbursement. Coordinate cross Core Unit initiatives to solve multidisciplinary challenges. Perform transaction management by preparing and negotiating the term sheet, financing agreements, and ultimately coordinating transaction scheduling. Perform post-closing transaction management, providing administration of events during the deal\u2019s life. Provide transparent and open communications with all stakeholders and the MakerDAO community.   Facilitator Focus Driving the initiative to bring legal and transaction management skills to the DAO is proposed facilitator Christian Petersen @christiancdpetersen. Christian has supported MakerDAO\u2019s real-world finance Core Unit for the last 12 months and understands Maker\u2019s financing challenges on each deal. In addition to his time at Maker, Christian\u2019s experiences in the legal profession include:  Executing transactions in over 40 countries over 25 years. 15 years of private practice at international law firms and 10 years in-house Leading legal for the $16B Mozambique LNG project financing involving multiple export credit agencies, international commercial banks, and the African Development Bank. Leading legal for multiple multi-billion dollar LNG sale and purchase agreements for Mozambique LNG with buyers from Japan, China, Taiwan, India, France, the UK, and the Netherlands.  Christian\u2019s first-hand understanding of the roles played by various groups in a transaction supports developing a competent legal services Core Unit and a Core Unit that promotes and protects Maker\u2019s values. As such, LTS commits to:  Actively promote and abide by Maker DAO\u2019s radical transparency and openness promise. Measure accomplishment by meaningful and measurable collaboration with the Maker community, Core Units, and potential real-world users of the real-world asset program. Import the best international standards to Maker\u2019s real-world financing Aggressively merge TradFi and DeFi for the benefit of Maker and real-world finance. Demonstrate servant leadership.   Supporting Onboarding RWAs LTS\u2019s incubation announcement is the second of a three-part approach to restructuring MakerDAO\u2019s real-world lending activities for a sustainable and scalable future. More content is available on LTS and the larger initiative below:  Christian\u2019s recorded presentation on the proposed Lending and Transaction Services Core Unit is available to explore the team\u2019s mission and vision in greater detail. Opportunities to talk with Christian and the entire Real-world Assets team are possible during RWA Office Hours, Wednesdays at 17:00 UTC.
