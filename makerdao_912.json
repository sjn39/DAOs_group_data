The Deco Team is functioning as an outside organization providing development and support services to Maker.  We are live and operational; inquiries regarding Deco on Maker can be directed to [email\u00a0protected]. Vamsi can be reached at: [email\u00a0protected]. An operational staff is in place and a legal team including a corporate General Counsel to address legal issues.  Q1 Deco Development Status. The Deco on Maker core codebase, because of intense effort, is complete. It has also been subject to refactoring to simplify the Maker integration.  Documentation is also completed and available here. At this point, we have completed both the DSS-Gate sandbox development as well as completing the core Deco on Maker integration. DSS-gate was first presented during the G&R call in January and has now been delivered to PE. PE will take stewardship over the DSS-Gate contracts moving forward. The initial audit of the core integration has been completed by ChainSecurity and validates the integration design, implementation, and functionality. The final audit report will be uploaded to the documentation repository when available.  Q2 Deco Tentative Agenda. We expect completion of the Final Audit report for the Core Codebase and the Gate no later than the end of May. In Q2, we will also complete the UI and UX design process for the initial product. Our legal team will be engaging with Patent, Copyright, Securities, and other pertinent legal issues. We will also engage in pre-launch preparation, including formulating a general strategy or alignment with other Maker core units regarding potential users as well as requesting a \u201cgo live\u201d for Q3/Q4, including an introductory Deco/DSS-Gate approval limit.  Q2 Progress Report. Our next report will synchronize Deco with the calendar year and be on 15 July 2022. ",

Send us a note at [email\u00a0protected] with your questions regarding integrations with Deco and we will help you out.\" Considering the Maker protocol is funding not only salaries but even travel, legal, and marketing cost, shouldn\u2019t Deco be exclusive to Maker protocol? Wouldn\u2019t it be more than unfair that Maker protocol funds for such development which Deco team can potentially make more money for building it for other protocols? ",

Wouldn\u2019t it be more than unfair that Maker protocol funds for such development which Deco team can potentially make more money for building it for other protocols?   Bumping all of these fair questions again - surprised at the lack of communication here. It\u2019s interesting that while some cost centres for Maker attract a lot of heat and attention like Events, others seem to slip under the radar completely. It may be that Deco has good answers to all of the questions above but we wouldn\u2019t know (in governance) because none have been provided. Particularly now we are in a bear market, there seems to be a dangerous tendency of focusing on the CU spend that is the most clearly communicated, because it is the easiest to see (and critique). That produces a twisted incentive for CUs to present a low profile, communicate as little as possible, and quietly collect cheques from Maker (another 500 MKR is vesting for this CU in the current executive). That\u2019s not something we should want as a DAO. ",

Again, it may be there are good answers to the questions posed above and Deco is providing excellent value, but it\u2019s hard to draw that conclusion in a vacuum so I do think it\u2019s fair to ask these kinds of questions. Reading the Q1 progress report closely, Deco seems to mostly be providing technical work and support to PE. I would love to know more about the delineation between Deco\u2019s work for Maker and Deco\u2019s work elsewhere - for instance, is the legal advice around \u201cpatent, copyright, securities etc\u201d strictly for Deco or is it also shared with PE and other CUs?
