                    "content": "Hello, MakerDAO community, With the growing number of public calls at MakerDAO, we are looking to expand the size of the summary team. The Summary team is a group of contributors who work together week-to-week producing high-quality summaries and abbreviated snippets of important public calls; These include Governance and Risk meetings, Meet Your Delegate meeting, Speaker Series meetings, and more.  Check out the Governance Call Summary Guide  to get more details on how the team works. Here is an example G&R summary. Here is an example Snippet.  Join us as a writer or reviewer and earn 30 Dai per hour to help produce these call summaries! In addition, there is room for promotional opportunities as we are also in need of summary reviewers, who earn 40 Dai per hour! Reach out to me, @artemisios, on Rocketchat if you\u2019re interested or comment here on this thread!  ",

I am especially skilled at taking highly complex and nontraditional concepts and breaking them down into easily digestible and understandable morsels of knowledge even lay people can understand. I have experience writing for various technology enterprises on the topics of IT, cryptography, security, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), crypto-assets, and market manipulation or crypto \u201cinsider trading\u201d (in quotes because true insider trading legal definitions don\u2019t always apply). If you\u2019d like an example of some of my writings I can provide that for you easily. You can contact me over email or on the phone 562 666 6974 or [email\u00a0protected]. If I am in a meeting or asleep, just leave a message, I will call you right back as soon as possible (I\u2019m on PST, located in Southern California, USA) but you can call me any time. ",
