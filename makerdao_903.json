We\u2019re Penn Blockchain (@PennBlockchain on twitter), a leading, completely student run blockchain organization from The University of Pennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools. The club currently has over 50 members and we\u2019re expecting many more next semester! Penn Blockchain has committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Business Development, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team has different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we have delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, IndexCoop, etc. Each week, governance leads will share updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about what to do before voting with our wallet. Our internal voting process takes place on the weekends and is an equal weighted democratic process. Proposals that will expire before the weekend are debated on our internal messaging platforms with a majority vote being our overall end vote. Other governance initiatives involve:  Staying active within discussion forums Drafting new proposals when appropriate Staying up to date with protocols covered Discuss models and parameters with leading analysis companies like Gauntlet Communicating with internal team members Hosting speaker events with projects in conjunction with BD  We\u2019d love to be your Maker delegate as many of us have been following Maker for years now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of expertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to leave their impact and names in Web3. Members of our club are also actively working with the MakerDAO team internally on different projects, such as deploying a set amount of treasury assets in on chain initiatives. When delegating with us, rest assured your tokens are in the hands of one of the most hardworking and determined Blockchain clubs out there. It\u2019s a vote of confidence in University Blockchain clubs and we greatly appreciate your support. Finally, delegation with us is an agreement on our end to continue to do our due diligence and uphold quality and consistent work. As always, thanks so much for your time and we truly appreciate your consideration. Possible Conflicts of Interest  Penn Blockchain takes part actively in the governance of other well known projects This proposal\u2019s author (juanbugeth on twitter) is helping internally with MakerDAO with possible on chain strategies for increasing treasury and liquidity for DAI  I have read and agree to abide by the Delegate Code of Conduct. Waiver of liability By delegating to Penn Blockchain, you acknowledge and agree that Penn Blockchain will participate on a best efforts basis and will not be liable for any form of damages related to participation in the Maker Protocol, or MakerDAO.

The vaults seem to be something that we could easily employ ourselves with no need for exorbitant fees from a third party. Additionally, a few members with legal background brought up the huge regulatory concerns regarding this decision. A fixed rate instrument, something closely monitored and oversaw by the SEC, could just complicate things further. Finally, when looking at the forums and community, we don\u2019t see the necessary demand for this product, at least at the current time to warrant this implementation.

Additionally, having professional bod managers looking over stuff from a RWA standpoint is very nice, and coupled with the fact that this will be one of the first RWA strategies to return on investment, this is one we are definitely interested in exploring. Ratification Poll for Monetalis Lusitano, UK Green Economy SME Wholesale Lending (MIP68) - May 9, 2022 We voted YES: First off, very interesting name, quite fitting indeed. This will help align our green money vision as well as create new opportunities in the climate markets. In short, we believe Monetalis can help position Maker as one of the forefronts of the ESG movements. We believe the proper due diligence has been done and are interested in seeing more vome out of this. Ratification Poll for L2-to-L1 Fast Withdrawals (MIP69) - May 9, 2022 We voted YES: With the new Maker teleport, this is a pretty simple and ecstatic yes. We can quickly withdraw DAI first from Eth mainnet to and from L2, Arbitrum and Optimism. When doing so, DAI is minted on one end and destroyed on the other, causing near instant bridges. We are in support of the 1 bps fee as proposed in the signal request as it is much easier to go down in fees than raise them later and could provide another possibly uncorrelated revenue stream for Maker! Ratification Poll for MIP40 Budget Process Amendment (MIP4c2-SP19) - May 9, 2022 We voted YES: It seems rather apparent in our time as delegates that the budget proposal and requests feature is a bit chaotic. We believe this amendment that would help increase the structure of such proposals is something much needed going into the future. Overall we will still rely on the Core Units to make well informed decisions about the budget, but this is a good step forward in standardizing the process. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness (SH-001) Core Unit Budget Modification (MIP40c3-SP67) - May 9, 2022 We voted YES: This one man team is quite impressive indeed. We believe that someone who has gone above and beyond to lighten the mood and spread merch amongst the community should be well treated. With not just this Core Unit, but with all, we urge them to be as mindful of the markets and plan their budgets accordingly during these tumultuous times. Overall, we at Penn Blockchain greatly realize the efforts put forth by this cu and are confident it will be kept up! (PS: We would like a few pieces of merch as well haha). ",

This will raise the barrier in dollar terms back to something comparable when it was last agreed upon. Adjust the lid Parameter on the Rate Limited Flapper - May 16, 2022 We voted YES: This change of the lid parameter has no real technical risk. When the burning mechanism does possibly come back into the picture, it limits the maximum number of MKR from 7.2m to 1.4m dai a day; smoothing out the mechanism. ",

When digging into the forum post, we see resounding yes support for this vault, from many of the key workers at Maker. Investigate Deploying the MakerDAO Balance Sheet in ETH - May 23, 2022 We voted YES: This is a very important decision for Maker and something that could heavily impact the protocol. As laid out in the original forum post by Seb, by not deploying in Maker, this puts us at a disadvantage to positive price action compared to Tribe, angle, etc. Additionally, with the merge incoming, yields for eth will be quite high making it a productive asset and we can also capture some of that demand now. Contrarily, we advise that at least one year of runway for the protocol should be kept at least in DAI, with initial recommendation of 10% before scaling up or down depending on price action. Launch Maker Teleport with 1 Basis Point Fee - May 23, 2022 We voted YES: A resounding yes. As one of our club members helped out on this proposal, our answer may be a bit biased. However overall as a club, we believe instituting a bridge with a small fee and then deciding to take away or increase is much easier than starting off with no fee and then going up. All the major bridges take a fee of some sort and it could be a great way to provide some passive income for Maker that wouldn\u2019t be as correlated as everything else. Community Greenlight Poll - FEI (Fei USD) - May 16, 2022 We voted YES: This was a rather heavily debated topic in our club. On one hand, FEI has shown resilience during these tumultuous times and held high. However, as said, it is tumultuous times and it\u2019s important to shelter up with safer assets. An important factor in our decision for this came down to our delegate platforms\u2019 value which include factoring into our delegate base, which is overwhelmingly in support. Overall we think the team should have the greenlight in allowing this, but exercise precaution and their expertise in setting parameters and a launch date/time. ",

Further, the specified MKR for the core units should be sent out to the respective teams. Finally, the lid parameter (which sets the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to the surplus auctions at once) goes down from 150k to 30k, effectively cutting down the number of parallel flap auctions from 5 to 1.

Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c7-SP2 - Modify Oracle Data Models - May 30, 2022 We voted YES: We are in support of MIP10c7-SP2 being accepted and implemented. The updated oracle data models for the listed paris in the discussion will provide up to date pricing models and is essential for Maker\u2019s health. The pairs listed in the most recent discussion thread are a good addition in our opinion. Short Ratification Poll for MIP10c19-SP1 - Update Oracle Expiration Time for All Oracles - May 30, 2022 We voted YES: This seems like a no brainer. With basically no downside, instead of 15,500 seconds, and using 24 hours instead; if there\u2019s the ability to save from the super high oracle prices, then we might as well use this new timing instead!

Here\u2019s our reasoning:   We voted no because it looks like the reflective Aave proposal is not going to pass, the likelihood of an illiquid or underwater DAI liquidity on Aave seems super low. We\u2019re confident in Aave liquidators to appropriately eliminate bad debt if stETH falls even lower on the peg. Even more so in a bear market, this revenue stream is incredibly important and something we don\u2019t think we should turn off currently.   There is no way to no to executive proposals, and so we had to choose to either submit the vote or not. Given the proposal had already passed, and after some talk with Gov Alpha, we ultimately chose in favor of \u201csecuring the hat\u201d and following the precedent set by Frank: Flip Flop Flap Delegate LLC Platform - #81 by ElProgreso by still voting on this executive.

Those include, among others:  Structures and credit enhancing mechanism (think of a securitisation for example) Process and interest alignment Counterparty and market expertise Internal processes and conflicts of interest  In doing so, LOVE wants to augment RISK deep skills and act as a super streamlined yet senior risk overlay. That is why we intend to attract very few people with 10-15 of experience in banking and financial services. I hope that you\u2019ll reassess the possibility to vote in favour of LOVE if by the end of the voting period your vote will become important in deciding the future of this core unit.

Specifically, decreasing the WSTETH-B stability fee to 0 to incentivize dai creation while increasing the fee for Uni-lps since they\u2019ve reached highs once again and we might as well earn some yields off of them. Maker Teleport Deployment on Starknet and Associated Risk Parameters - August 1, 2022 We voted YES: Agree with starknet facilitator\u2019s opinions; and are looking forward to this implementation. Setting the debt ceiling is good, and we\u2019d encourage maybe increasing the fee in the future to create another revenue stream for the protocol. Tactical Re-allocation Process for Budget Adjustments - August 1, 2022 We voted YES: In general tactical reallocation of the budget for different CUs is needed and we think should be done periodically. Will be very interested to see how discussions go forward. A concern we did have was that the wording on the formal poll was a bit \u201cintense\u201d and seemed to give SFCU a lot more oversight than what the forum signal request emphasized. After confirming that nothing had changed between moving the signal poll onchain, and this new strong wording was just semantics, we saw no reason as to why this shouldn\u2019t \u201cbe greenlighted\u201d as it is purely a way to get the ball rolling and won\u2019t make \u201cchanges in isolation,\u201d  but instead lead to future proposals after further communication and research. MIP9 Community Greenlight Poll - Pando (Pando Investment Grade Climate Assets) - August 1, 2022 We voted NO: Ultimately our decision can be summarized into: we don\u2019t think the gained extrinsic benefits from taking on this deal in the form of positive publicity offsets the subpar yield for a BBB+ loan, and longer liquidity. We enjoyed reading input from the RWF team, Seb, Delegates, Rune, dbkcan, Blocktower, etc., and were impressed by the level of professionalism and diligence the Pando team took in responding to most major points of concern. Overall, we\u2019re not happy voting no as just the publicity from being able to use DAI as collateral to pay off clean money would be a pretty big step forward in showcasing how blockchain and defi can have tangible real life benefits. Unfortunately, with everything RWA analyzes, there\u2019s a huge opportunity cost. The term maturity of 12 years and WAL of 6 years mean if something goes south, a good chunk of collateral will be closely locked up. Finally, the low ~3% yield on a BBB+ is vastly outperformed by certain A loans earning over 5%. As Jack from Blocktower states well,\u201dit is tough to justify this [2%] gap when the most senior piece of solar securitizations, which has more downside protection, yields 5%.\u201d ",

Ratification Poll for Modify Oracle Core Unit Budget (MIP40c3-SP75) - August 8, 2022 We voted Approve proposed budget (Reduced budget exempt from further cuts for 12 months): We think this proposal of decreasing budgets but making sure this decrease is the amount for the upcoming year is something that more core units will probably tend towards. It decreases the burn for the DAO and also gives the CU some financial stability in the upcoming months to concentrate on other things and not be as worried that their funding will disappear. Ratification Poll for MIP50 Direct Deposit Module Amendment (MIP4c2-SP23) - August 8, 2022 We voted YES: Pretty simple decision here. Thanks to Sam for expanding the scope of the wording of MIP50. Ratification Poll for Makershire Redux (MIP76) - August 8, 2022 We voted YES: Much of the same reasoning for our yes vote on the Makershire V1 proposal. Except now, this is purely a stablecoin yield accretion tool. With principal being always kept, the proposed allocations make sense in today\u2019s market. Not exploring ways of generating any passive yield is no longer an option. Ratification Poll for Offboarding Events Core Unit (EVENTS-001) - August 8, 2022 We voted NO: This is a tricky one. On one hand, events in a bear market should be the first unit to go. On another hand, us as delegates voted them in not too long ago and what bad precedence does this show if the events team did nothing intrinsically wrong, the market just took a bad turn? In this case, we decided ultimately that the blame ultimately falls on us delegates and is something we must keep in mind in the future when onboarding similar CUs. For events, we hope the team can cost effectively put on future events and re-evaluate their budget in the future. ",

Community Greenlight Poll - GNO (GnosisDAO) - September 5, 2022 We voted YES: This proposal was one of the very few we\u2019ve liked recently. GNO has shown price resilience and the team as a whole has been very good at shipping out new products. Maybe the most important thing that arises from this is our continued relationship with the xDAI chain where DAI retains its spot as the #1 stable. Community Greenlight Poll - GAMMA UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC (Gamma Uniswap v3 wBTC-renBTC) - September 5, 2022 & Community Greenlight Poll - GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI (Gelato Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI) - September 5, 2022 We voted NO & NO: Our reasoning for these two were similar. Although the renBTC pair has some liquidity, we don\u2019t see either having the required amount to substantially increase revenues to the Maker ecosystem. Further, adding in oracle costs could easily have these pairs operate at a net loss. Further questions of decentralization and safety are also raised, but from a simple profit generation standpoint, these pairs aren\u2019t worth it at this time, especially given the need to focus on other topics at hand.

By setting a decreased time, this gives delegates a greater chance of \u201cclawing\u201d out of a hole of inactivity and lets them get rewarded for active work sooner. Ratification Poll for MKR Compensation for StarkNet Engineering Core Unit, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP79) - September 12, 2022 We voted NO: This was a close vote and it ultimately came down to us thinking that in the current situation of crypto and Maker, adding and extra 135 MKR per employee is just significantly more than what we had in mind for when Starknet CU was first incubated, given the fact that they are also paid in half by Starknet themselves. Ratification Poll for Special Purpose Fund for The Ambassador Program (MIP55c3-SP7) - September 12, 2022 We voted YES: This is a great case of a really positive SPF for Maker. We think the Ambassador program will introduce Maker to thousands and thousands of more people in groups that have been traditionally underrepresented and focused on groups. Ratification Poll for Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP80) - September 12, 2022 We voted 150% Multiplier (247.70 total MKR): We think the GovAlpha team has some of the hardest and smartest workers at Maker as a whole. Taking into consideration the market as a whole, we think their output is still very sufficient to justify a a 150% multiplier on their current MKR vests. Ratification Poll for Strategic Happiness Core Unit (SH-001) Offboarding (MIP39c3-SP2) - September 12, 2022 We voted NO: This vote is made with the intention of voting yes here: Rune\u2019s Post. We think the latter\u2019s terms of service termination are much more amicable and think that for someone who meant a lot to a lot of people at Maker, the \u201cGolden Parachute\u201d is a fully justified and necessary termination compensation.

For such large increases in pay, we do think abstaining in most situations as a delegate is always an option to consider in terms of conflict of interest. In the end, we chose No as given the timing of such a proposal and how we are implementing DAO wide budget cuts, increasing our own didn\u2019t seem appropriate. Happy to revisit in the future. Community Greenlight Poll - RFA (RFA - Canadian Federally Regulated Mortgage Originator) - September 19, 2022 We voted YES: We vote to greenlight this proposal.

Change PSM-GUSD-A Parameters - October 10, 2022 We voted YES: Pending recent discussions by Gemini regarding paying us 1.25% interest when the GUSD PSM is above 100M, the DAO is highly incentivized to keep as much GUSD in the PSM as possible. Increasing the parameters does just that and is something we should implement right away. End DAI Funding For Sourcecred - October 10, 2022 We voted YES: All things considered, we are glad the sourcecred experiment happened but agree with Gov Alpha that at the current time, this extra burn on both DAI and operational costs might not be wholly beneficial for the DAO and should reconsider starting up again in a future point in time if deemed necessary. MOMC Guidance - Remove ETH Supply Yield And Liquidity Incentives From D3M Target Borrow Rate Calculations - October 10, 2022 We voted YES: Agreeing with the risk core unit on modifying the D3M in accordance with its recommendations. MOMC Guidance - Allowed Spread Between D3M Target Borrow Rate And ETH-A Stability Fee October 10, 2022 We voted Option 1 - 0.5%: Although we held off this time, it was very interesting to see the new approval voting in effect. Our reasoning for voting just the 0.5% was we think we should slowly decrease the allowed spread and although it may not be as much revenue as 0%, slowly decreasing it over time is our preferred method. Ratification Poll for Endgame Prelaunch MIP Set - October 10, 2022 We voted YES: The first vote in a very exciting Endgame MIP set coming up to vote.

In full support of the new Risk CU, SF CU, and CES CU mandates, both in the wake of the RWF dissolution and Endgame plan!

For MIP81, the CES has proposed a technical solution to custody and should be moved forward ASAP. MIP82 with less liquidity should be gradually onboarded and in appropriate sizes, but also presents the DAO with a lottt of revenue for reasonable risks.

We believe, especially at this time, there won\u2019t be much value add to onboarding new facilitators and could result in many headaches down the road. Budget Ratification Poll for Modify Development and UX Core Unit (DUX-001) Budget (MIP40c3-SP82) - November 14, 2022 We voted Approve reduced budget - NewBear: With endgame getting implemented over the next year, we recognize the DUX team will have a lot of work creating and updating new front ends. However, looking at their most recent spending data, their annualized last 3 month spending is a little north of 1.2 million, compared to their 1.9 current budget. Even with this new \u201cBear case\u201d budget of 1.4 million, we believe this ~20% buffer between current spending and new budget is appropriate and robust enough to handle new responsibilities. Ratification Poll for CoinShares Active Treasury Management (MIP86) - November 14, 2022 We voted NO: We realize and understand the need for diversify, however, given current market conditions and a still ever expanding list of FTX related parties, and knowing CoinShares has some exposure to FTX, we\u2019d like to wait for now and let the dust settle for a little bit. Ratification Poll for OUSD Decentralized Rewards (MIP87) - November 14, 2022 We voted NO: Echoing many of the opinions shared above. Main reason for this is the yields associated with OUSD are still below US treasury bond rates. Following in line with passed Endgame directions, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate right now for this addition. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Redwood Friesian (MIP88) - November 14, 2022 We voted YES: Looking forward to what will be known as the Viridian Cluster. We believe this safe super senior AAA rated  RMBS for up to 225M of USDC acquired from the PSM will allow for safe and diligently managed yields for Maker. Ratification Poll for Monetalis - Arrow Andalusian (MIP89) - November 14, 2022 We voted YES: Echoing above notes, looking forward to the Viridian Cluster and the start of MIP88 & MIP89. This proposal\u2019s structure is similar to prior MIPs and looking forward to kick starting the clean money initiatives.

This seems very steep, especially for market conditions at that time. Looking at their last four month reported expenses:  June: $86,756.97 July: $85,209.39 August: $165,261.75 (compensation increased from 65k to 130k+, more than doubled from prior months. Curious what this was?) September: $113,358.99 (taking out the $63,000 of travel and entertainment when considering budget renewal) October & November: No data  Adding up these four months gets $450,587.10. Pro-rated to 1 year gets $1.35mil. We believe this should be the bear case, (call it 1.5mil or so). This was a tough decision as we understand techops has a lot on their plate and will have a lot in the upcoming year, however, the 2.4mil they requested, which is a 75%+ increase over what we think is fair in current market conditions, is just too high. We\u2019d love to see a reproposal with a modified bear and base case, as many other proposals have done. PS: Would love some clarity from the core team, or anyone who knows, about rather peculiar spending reporting. ",

For many of these renewals, we see teams utilizing 50% of their requested budgets from last year, meaning their bear case budgets are still like 25%+ of what they currently spend; therefore in reality, no real decreased costs and budget cuts are happening. This is not the case for SES, and we believe the slightly increased request for speedily getting Endgame up and running this upcoming year is necessary and well deserved before they wind down operations/ become EAs.

I\u2019ll try and cover your raised points one by one: Travel expenses draw - a lump sum had to be drawn to be able to book all the travel related expenses - hotel, flights, co-working space and any activities. That is the technical reason, on a more human level, this expense is essential to the team morale because of the fact that the whole team never actually met each other face to face! It is crucial for the team to get together in one place, spend some time together, plan for the future and simply get to know each other. We\u2019ve never done this (not in 2021 or 2022) and will be aiming for 2 of these \u201coff-sites\u201d next year (2023). Lastly whatever is not spent from that 63k of course will be returned. Compensation increase in August - 2 (fantastic) new hires. It was mentioned in Core Unit updates forum thread. Expenses data in the Dashboard - this is uploaded on the monthly basis around mid month for the previous month. So October data is up, November will come max mid December if not earlier. In addition we are also using GitHub to publish expense reports. As a general comment on the budget amount - remember the number requested is an absolute max cap. So looking at this years budget and expenses, we\u2019ve under spent over 1 mil from this year\u2026 Yes we should probably tighten up our forecast in the future but in this dynamic infrastructure world and the crazy crypto tech space we\u2019re in we opted to be on the safe side. Let us know if that clears it up a bit. Simon and Dumitru! ",

Ratification Poll for Commercial Risk and Legal Domain Work to Support SF-001 Expanded Mandate Related to RWAs (MIP55c3-SP12) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: As SF\u2019s mandate recently changed, the extra funds for commercial risk and legal domain work is needed.

Ratification Poll for Protocol DAI Transfer to Fund IS-001 from Dec 2022 to May 2023 (MIP14c2-SP2) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: We think this temporary funding for IS CU is proper for the temporary funding needed to tie over the core unit until they fully transition to an EndGame ecosystem actor. Ratification Poll for Requesting Protocol DAI Transfer to fund TechOps CU for February 2023 (MIP14c2-SP1) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: We think the most recent CU budget that was denied was good for reevaluating the core unit\u2019s budget. This temporary funding is reasonable and we believe is proper until they resend their new budget. Ratification Poll for Remove MIP14c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling) (MIP4c2-SP32) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: As Endgame comes more and more into fruition, there will most likely be the need for more and more protocol transfers of higher amounts.

Ratification Poll for Obsolete MIP Removal (MIP23, MIP28) (MIP4c4-SP3) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: These MIPs are obsolete now and have been superseded, and therefore no longer needed to be active.

Ratification Poll for Amend MIP61 to tighten up Recognized Delegate Participation Metrics (MIP4c2-SP29) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: As the role of a delegate ever so changes, we think the adaptation to discourage abstain votes and an increased emphasis on Executive votes is a good change.

Given all the discussion on the forums and the core Gemini team\u2019s reassurances, we are confident enough that 1) The Gemini team will not be liable for this ~900m hole that Genesis frauded Gemini\u2019s customers on and 2) In an esoteric situation where Gemini core product goes under, GUSD will still be fully redeemable and with high liquidity due to its US (New York) oversight and history/set up. Further, the current deal we have with Gemini is one of the best proposals in the space for MakerDAO and considering the very sizable $500k December payment, a $6m yearly revenue if very important to the DAO and something that we believe the benefits heavily outweigh the benefits for. Therefore, we are in favor of maximizing GUSD in the PSM as before, hence the above votes. ",

Ratification Poll for Defense Fund (MIP55c3-SP14) - January 9, 2023 We voted YES: We think having this passive defense fund in case any qualifying legal charges are incurred is good practice and a good hedge to have.

Ratification Poll for $100M of Cogent Bank Loan Participations (MIP95) - February 13, 2023 We voted NO: This was the trickiest and toughest decision of this set of votes. Our decision on this was two stages. Early on, we were split pretty much 50/50 on this. Overall, we think this is pretty much a copy paste of the HVB decision that passed earlier. The risk and reward profiles for Maker were similar. However, even if the vote were to be passed, it wouldn\u2019t actually ever be initiated, due where we currently are in Maker\u2019s Endgame and the focus and scope of that. This split our opinions pretty much half and half down the line. The second stage was earlier today when we realized that this vote ultimately was not going to pass. This pushed us over to the opinion that there was no point in trying to push through a vote that was most likely not going to pass and even if it did, nothing would ever realistically come out of it and just possibly take up overhead budget and time for respective CUs. All in all, we truly do appreciate @maxglass\u2019 and everyone else who spoke with us\u2019 time. ",
