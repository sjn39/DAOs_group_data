I didn\u2019t say that tokens should be primarily focused on voting, I\u2019m not against it either, i actually don\u2019t have an opinion yet on the matter. What i believe is that there are many interesting ways to channel the available UNI tokens, but the proportion of those initiatives are not obvious nor irrelevant. I just said that two of those ways are rewarding voters, and rewarding LP\u2019s. My impression is that such a mechanism won\u2019t be necessary since we can reward voters and LP\u2019s separately, and in proportion to their contribution. I don\u2019t see any reason we should give extra to anyone doing both activities at the same time. Having said that, i think all ideas regarding governance are appreciated here, its good to see members thinking and proposing their thoughts on this platform. so keep it up Tim, great job. A final thought: it may have been a good idea to post this initiative with a poll so we get a better idea of what the community thinks about it\u2026 ",

So I use Curve and I locked some CRV tokens in the locker for 4 years to get the 2.5X multiplier reward on my staked sUSD share. This idea clicked in my head for UNI and how Uniswap could implement a \u201cLocker\u201d just like Curve and allow people to lock UNI away for 1, 2, 3, or 4 years and receive a multiplier like 1.5X, 2X or 2.5X on their share of staked assets and receive more UNI in their UNI yield farming. It\u2019s a genius way to make the UNI token worth more via locking it in a locker for years and gives it more use. Also would love to see a staking pool for just UNI or some type of incentive to lock up UNI in some way. Would love to hear your thoughts and would love to cast a vote on this some day! Cheers! ",

Heck, this idea is growing in my head. Why not have Uniswap become its own thing and have a mainnet launch. It could be a Proof-of-Stake consensus and UNI is the native token. You stake it, become a validator node and receive boost on LP from your staked UNI as a reward for being a node. UNI would be the native token. Breaking away from Ethereum.

Conceptually one can calculate UNI * Number of possible votes and then calculate a GOVERNANCE_PARTIPIATION_RATIO = 0-1 (this would be a running fractional value based on theoretical governance participation vs. actual) on this and any basic UNI LP rewards get the BOOST*G_R_P + BASELPREWARD.    This would make not just holding UNI important but also using it in governance as critical to be able to get the UNI LP BOOST amount. My only issue with doing this on UNI UNI-tokenpairs is that unless we can take and use UNI UNI-tokenpairs in governance since it is appealing to want to incentivize people to put UNI into uniswap for liquidity this also takes UNI away from governance.   I generally don\u2019t like to see competition for governance tokens from liquidity contracts as this tends to drain votes that could and should be used for governance. ",
