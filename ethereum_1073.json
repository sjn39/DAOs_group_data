Only little repricing will be necessary when EIP 2046 is accepted  SHA256 precompile  Currently it\u2019s 60 gas + 12 gas per 32 byte word.

Besu implementation is Java built-in, so I doubt it can be improved, so it would be better to set A = 9, B = 10 that largely fits everyone. There are no large one-off costs in this precompile, so it\u2019s EIP 2046 - safe.  RIPEMD precompile  Currently it\u2019s 600 gas + 120 gas per 32 byte word.
