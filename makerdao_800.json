Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP67 updates the budget to expand the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001. It proposes an updated budget breakdown for DAI and MKR. In total, 770,000 DAI is requested (230,000 DAI up-front). Additionally, a 250 MKR vest is requested, streamed over 4 years with an 18-month cliff.  A pro-rated offboarding term is also proposed for 2 months of funding if, after funding this Core Unit until March 15, 2023, the community decides not to renew a further budget.  Specification  Motivation  Community Building  Promote group cohesion and internal morale throughout MakerDAO. Grow our community and attract talent via targeted Swag Airdrops and genuine interactions.   Brand Awareness  Maintain a presence at external events & conferences to support MakerDAO. Participate in curating events hosted by MakerDAO. Fulfill custom swag requests. Generally promote and defend the Maker brand and its image in the space.   Project Growth  Support the Growth Core Unit in building client relationships, as requested. Take advantage of serendipitous in-person interactions to achieve these goals.     Swag Airdrops SHCU Swag Airdrops focus on several kinds of recipients:  MakerDAO Core Unit & Community Members Potential New Hires Partner projects & potential collaborators Anyone that might be interested in MakerDAO, both inside and outside the crypto space.  Since its inception, the SHCU has delivered over 100+ airdrops, and many satisfied recipients have shared on social media, increasing its total reach. In past years, MakerDAO would sponsor events to promote its image. However, recently, Maker opted out of an ETH Denver sponsorship.  The SHCU stepped in and applied its budget.  2000 beanies for DAIVinity & conference attendees. 100+ Socks, T-Shirts, and Hoodies for other Maker fans. Backpacks and North Faces for MakerDAO members.   The final result:  Better visibility than a sponsorship with ETH Denver. Lasting appreciation by swag recipients. Significant savings compared to an ETH Denver sponsorship fee.    The SHCU desires to recreate these results on an ongoing basis, aiming for one to three events and 25-50+ airdrops per quarter. The requested budget modifications will allow the SHCU to continue operating at the professional level MakerDAO requires.   Going Forward  Integrate AccountAble for accounting & expense tracking. Create a secure multi-sig for the SHCU\u2019s budget. Hire part-time employees for assistance with:  Coordination, design, swag distribution, budgeting, and general assistance.   Scale-up production of high-quality, creative swag.  Distribute curated swag at events where MakerDAO would have a presence. Resume Swag Airdrops!   Set up a new Official Maker Swag Shop! *  If successful, its revenue could offset many of the SHCU\u2019s expenditures. The shop will feature items people can order at any time.  Limited edition items will not really be available there. If you want that reallyyy unique thing, you\u2019ll have to get it from me directly. : )    SaaS: Swag as a Service   @flipflopflapdelegate\u2019s suggestion to model SwaggerDAO could be pretty lucrative.    * Note:  Excluding this item from the budget for now. The SHCU may still take over the existing Swag Shop and revamp it. Will submit a separate proposal later.       Personal Note Personally, I am incredibly bullish on Maker, its future, and the future of DAI. Maker and its community have truly become my second family. In my darkest times, you have all been there for me. You\u2019ve all shown me that you genuinely care for me and each other. That is rare in this world! I am infinitely grateful to all of you. You\u2019ve opened doors for me that I never imagined existed. Just being part of the MakerDAO community has brought me untold opportunities. I originally started the Strategic Happiness Core Unit as a bit of a meme, but it\u2019s grown into so much more since then! Given how long I\u2019ve been with Maker, I didn\u2019t request a salary or a vest. I genuinely wanted to see our project do well and be part of its success. I\u2019m fully aware that lately, I\u2019ve been participating less regularly. Sadly, the number went down, and it took a toll on me. Still, I do my best to stick to my original mandate! Make everyone happy!  That said, I believe our community is starting to see the value that I bring  : )   Team Membership The Strategic Happiness Core Unit team will include:   @Saint.Burban: Shitpost Facilitator Chief Happiness Officer  Part-Time Assistant(s): Design, Curation, Vendor Sourcing, Logistics, Cost-Tracking, Budgeting, General Assitance   Facilitator As the Facilitator of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit, it\u2019s been my job to raise the morale of our community and get others outside our community excited about Maker and DAI. Initially, I proposed a salary of 0 DAI for myself. It was a unique way to get involved, and I know everyone got a kick out of it too : ) I would like to continue doing what I do. It\u2019s fun, and doing it for free was cool. However, over the past six months, I\u2019ve seen a lot of ways I can take on more responsibilities and invest more time to deliver greater value to MakerDAO. I will be delivering and creating more swag while helping to bring additional value to various Maker teams and coordinate great events. Much of what I\u2019ve been doing has received overwhelmingly positive feedback, and many have urged me to get paid for my efforts. I\u2019m including budget revisions based on recent community feedback on spending and SHCU direction.

Budget Breakdown     Item Amount     Dai Compensation    Facilitator 17,500 DAI   Part-Time Assistance 15,000 DAI   Swag 80,000 DAI   Shipping 10,000 DAI   Travel 12,500 DAI   Ongoing Operations 20,000 DAI   Contingency Buffer 25,000 DAI   Total Quarterly 180,000 DAI     Restock Swag Inventory [Single-Payment]     Item Amount     Restock Inventory 50,000 DAI   Total 50,000 DAI     Budget Line Items  Compensation The SHCU team will have:  One Facilitator Part-Time Assistance   Salaries Annual compensation will be:   Andrew Burban: 70,000 DAI  Part-Time Assistance: 60,000 DAI  Note I: These figures are well below market rates to demonstrate a long-term commitment to MakerDAO and this core unit. The compensation I\u2019m requesting can be viewed as a stipend.  As a long-term member of the Maker community, if Maker does well, we all do well. If the community is happy with the SHCU\u2019s performance and sees the value it brings, the figures may be revised later if appropriate.  Note II: The part-time budget is an allowance figure. Scaling the SHCU is not feasible alone, but, at the same time, hiring a full-time employee does not make sense right now either. The 60,000 DAI is intended for assistance with small tasks. Unused funds would be credited towards future quarters. However, this figure may be revised if more consistent assistance is required. Note III: I\u2019ve removed healthcare from the budget to reduce costs. For now, I am covered under a personal plan, and part-time employees would not be eligible.  Travel I anticipate travel to be a significant part of this core unit\u2019s expenditures. I am requesting a quarterly budget of 12,500 Dai for travel covering all team members.  One of the primary goals for this core unit is to promote our brand\u2019s image.  This requires attending major events worldwide, where Maker plans to have a presence. This core unit will curate, produce, and distribute unique swag for each event.  This may require renting larger vehicles, flying, and lodging more frequently.   Currently, there are plans for:  ETH Amsterdam (late April 2022). Several more in the coming months. Also, special swag was made for ETH Denver and the Harvard Event in Boston, which just passed.     Some quarters may be slower or more active than others.  Unspent travel funds will carry over into the next quarter during quieter periods. The contingency buffer would be available for busier quarters.     Ongoing Operations:  Operational Overhead AccountAble: $10,000 TokenTax Software Grammarly Other Subscriptions Miscellaneous Costs   Swag Our goal is to produce high-quality, durable swag to promote MakerDAO\u2019s image.  People should be proud to wear, use, and show off their gear. Cutting corners and producing sub-par quality items hurts our image.  Also, those items typically end up in the trash. Money is wasted, and pollution is created.   Making higher quality merchandise is more expensive but worth the cost.  At scale and with further planning, costs per item would come down but still won\u2019t be cheap.    Based loosely on previous events and depending on a given event\u2019s size:  Approximate cost per event: $20,000-$35,000+ Reach: 500-2000+ people  Plus, countless more when they share online : )    Assuming the SHCU produces swag for about three events per quarter:  We can expect production to cost approximately $60,000-$120,000 quarterly. Some quarters may have fewer events, while others may have more. Based on demand, this number may be revised in the future.   Note: As with the previous SHCU budget, I vow to treat all funds streamed to the SHCU by the DAO with respect. I try to be honest with my spending and do my best to only spend when necessary. Any remaining funds will be credited towards the next quarter or sit idle until busier times.     Shipping This budget includes 10,000 DAI for shipping. This figure is a rough estimate of what it may cost to ship items to and from events and to any airdrop recipients. Shipping costs fluctuate wildly, especially when shipping internationally. This figure does not include much slack, but any unused funds would be set aside for other quarters.  Restocking the Swag Inventory Lately, I\u2019ve run through my entire inventory. I would like to invest in restocking generic branded items like T-Shits, Hoodies, Socks, Hats, etc. I prefer to have swag on hand for grab & go events or for anyone I may meet on a whim. I\u2019d also like to resume shipping individual swag airdrops. To do this, I need to invest in a small inventory, which I anticipate lasting a while. Depending on variety and quantity, restocking may cost around $35,000-$50,000. The budget includes a one-time distribution of 50,000 DAI to meet this need.  Swag Budget Caveats Above, I\u2019ve listed the real numbers required to produce high-quality curated merch for our events. A typical larger event may reasonably cost around $25,000-$35,000. Creating swag for smaller events can probably cost approximately $15,000-$20,000.  The SCHU can fund about two or three events per quarter with the proposed budget implementation.  If there are more events in a given quarter, I will be counting on other CU\u2019s interested in collaborating for our events to chip down and supplement some of these expenditures. We can work together to produce unique and special Maker Swag, custom-tailored to each occasion.  Contingency Buffer The budget includes a buffer for incidentals.   Clarifications  Standard Unwind Term To avoid burdening Maker governance, SHCU is proposing the following terms. The budget term ends March 15, 2023. At the end the budget term, if Maker governance decides not to renew the budget, the SHCU will default to unwind on a two-month term, pro-rated under the current budget. Any funds not used for salary and operations will be appropriately returned to the DAO.  Budget Request Up-Front For the next funding cycle, I am requesting funding up-front, as follows:     Description Amount     Quarterly Budget 180,000 DAI   Restock Inventory 50,000 DAI   Total 230,000 DAI     Transfers  Core Unit Wallet Address   Address: 0x955993Df48b0458A01cfB5fd7DF5F5DCa6443550  Keyholder: @aburban90    Core Unit Multi-Sig Address (2/6)   Address: 0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d  Owners: @aburban90 @Nadia @tadeo @hexonaut @juan @0xdeniz    Initial Transfer   Amount: 230,000 DAI  Description: Up-front payment for the new quarterly budget.   DssVest Stream   Amount: 540,000 DAI  Description: Ongoing Core Unit Expenses  Address: 0xc657aC882Fb2D6CcF521801da39e910F8519508d  Start Date: June 1, 2022  End Date: March 15, 2023    MKR Vesting The Strategic Happiness Core Unit seeks to vest its members with MKR to further align incentives. However, the SHCU would first like to demonstrate its value to MakerDAO governance.  MKR vest will use a non-standard cliff of 18 months. If Maker is dissatisfied with the SHCU, they can unwind the core unit without penalty using the unwind at the 12-month mark. This cliff reduces the risk of the MKR plan while still providing performance-based retention terms.  Vesting is proposed as follows:   Andrew Burban: 250 MKR   MKR Payment Implementation   Amount: 250 MKR  Cliff: 18 Months from approval date (May 23, 2022)  Addresses: 0x955993Df48b0458A01cfB5fd7DF5F5DCa6443550  Start Date: June 1, 2022  End Date: June 1, 2026    Related MIPS  MIP39c2-SP11: Strategic Happiness Core Unit MIP40c3-SP14: The Strategic Happiness Core Unit Budget, SH-001 MIP41c4-SP11: Shitpost Facilitator Onboarding, Strategic Happiness Core Unit, SH-001  ",

To summarize, the Strategic Happiness Core Unit works on memes and also swags.  This seems overly high. To give a perspective, this is 50% higher than base salary at Maker growth. And slightly more than even LongForWisdom\u2019s who spends literally everyday countless hours for the Maker protocol  ($144k based on Feb 21 proposal).      aburban90:  Annual compensation will be:   Andrew Burban: 150,000 DAI  Katherine Obermeyer: 150,000 DAI     250 MKR vesting per person is also much higher than many others. For example, Events Core Unit that is trying to onboard, it\u2019s 168.45 MKR per person.      aburban90:  Vesting is proposed as follows:   Andrew Burban: 250 MKR  Katherine Obermeyer: 250 MKR  New Hires: TBD     For two people, that\u2019s $9k per person per quarter so around 3k per person per month. Even if we assume the team travels every month, I think the amount seems to be on the higher side.      aburban90:  I am requesting a quarterly budget of 18,000 Dai for travel.    I get that you might need Kat\u2019s help in designing but is it really something that requires full time work all year around? Is it possible to share general overview of tasks she will be doing?      aburban90:  @kat: Full-Time, Employee Zero, Designer   ",

I\u2019m not looking to milk our DAO for a luxe salary of some kind. I\u2019m open to any number that everyone agrees is reasonable.

Especially regarding:     Doo_StableLab:  I have a lot of respect for what you do and it\u2019s always good to see you. It pains me to say this but I really think you should rethink about your proposal.   The first is the necessity or adding another FTE.   Example there is an events group asking for funds as well,   If anything I would like to see Events and Strategic Happiness try to share FTE resources since your teams would have to work together anyway. You are really going to have to figure out how to get this down to 1FTE at least as the rates/costs you are asking for. I keep thinking about how SH potentially could work to become revenue neutral by a focus on selling swag etc.  Think of it this way.   As a startup CU you get what you need to get going.  Events group needs swag for their event.  So from their budget SH basically sells them swag - at some reasonably discounted price - that still earns your SH unit an effective profit and brings in revenue to your unit. Also should Maker get more active in rewarding vault users or DAI borrowers I could see a grant for a swag promotion - open a new vault, borrow 100K DAI receive a free Maker hat swag where again SH sets a reasonable price with moderate profit and Maker puts up a grant.  Sure these are one Maker hand paying another but it illustrates how we can track cross CU work/product flows by tracking internal revenues and expenditures.   This is better than black boxing this money as straight expenditures. The point here is that I want to start seeing from CUs approaches to bring in outside revenues that can help offset the Maker budgetary costs as well as cross tracking revenues from other CUs to illustrate real working relationships that affect their budgets (funds moving around internally for services).    There will be many CUs that can\u2019t do this.  But I think this is something to consider for Strategic Happiness with swag and other Maker sales as well as for CUs in general. I think in the end when it comes to new budgets a real strong case has to be made about what services are being provided now, and what the cost is for continuity of those AS DISTINGUISHED from what we get if a higher budget than expected is proposed. You have laid out pretty clearly a bit of what you want, but you have not given us the baseline target of what is needed to keep doing what has already been done. BTW:  Since Risk put forward a budget request for retroactive pay.  I would be much more aligned to float you funds based on pay retroactively than boosting the current ask. Settle in for what you would want retroactively as one budget request, then what you need to continue existing SH ops, and then segregate out the boost for SH growth.   In my own view given the revenue to expense state asking for more is likely to not be approved.   Asking for what you need to keep doing what you have been doing (for free) will likely be negotiated but accepted if reasonable.   And once the what you need is negotiated and accepted, asking for retroactive pay over time based on on-going accepted cost is MUCH more likely to get approved. In your case you could keep this retroactive pay, or you could funnel it in to expand SH, then demonstrating some improvements in baseline deliverables perhaps ask for a budget increase later to sustain new SH ops. Just some suggestions and don\u2019t think this is a rejection.  It is a kindly request to bring this budget request down where at all possible. ",

Depending on where you live\u2026 @kat and I live in NYC, for example (god knows why we\u2019re still here\u2026 this place is a hell hole lol)\u2026 even a $200k salary doesn\u2019t even necessarily provide a particularly lavish standard of living. Somehow, you\u2019re still just struggling to make ends meet. That said\u2026 I\u2019m not looking to milk the DAO for something lavish for myself. I will revise to whatever people think is reasonable. ",

(@juan  :P) This said: I like you, we are chat buddies, and I have the impression that most people at Maker like you. You did well with your SH CU so far. But that started as a meme. If you now want to become a PRO (aka, get paid a salary) you need to be more professional, like all other CUs: precise timelines, milestones, etc, as others have pointed out. I agree with the comment from @MakerMan :     MakerMan:  I keep thinking about how SH potentially could work to become revenue neutral by a focus on selling swag etc.   MakerDAO should help you set up MakerDAO\u2019s shop (and hopefully retain property of it), and agree with you on a cut on the revenues that would constitute your (and your employees) \u2018salary\u2019. This way:  Maker pays for setting things up You get paid as long as you run it efficiently, and you are capable of doing that. Everybody is happy. If you go rouge, or business is bad, you can be removed and MakerDAO retains the webshop to be given to some other people to manage.  You are a great community member and have been a valuable Facilitator. Everybody wants you around! ",

The SH CU doesn\u2019t directly translate into growth, development or the security of the MakerDAO protocol. Which in my opinion should be the focus areas for our spending. I think the salary + vesting should reflect a function of the skill required to do the job + the experience of the employee. I believe we have a big gap here. Having merchandise is something which we historically had a person from marketing / events take care of, and it was by no means something we needed a full time position for. I get that with a swag shop it might be a bit more work, but with drop shipping and outsourcing of the storage I don\u2019t get how this would require that much more time. I think we need to think carefully about how we spend the Dai pool, and if this is really something we want to allocate that much money to. 1,179,000 for the first year is an insane amount of money to spend to get swag to the community. This can be done much cheaper, and most likely as a side function of another CU. This is even without the vesting included, which of course make this even more off the chart. I love the enthusiasm from everyone in the Maker community, and don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but just because you are supporting the community does not mean that you should be able to request huge pay-outs like this.

There is no debate on that and I\u2019m sure there is a proposal that fits the good work he is and can do in the future. The challenge I\u2019m observing is that people feel awkward openly criticizing this proposal because of a  \"friendship \"element, and that is a big  problem for the DAO. We have to separate friends from business in decision making, as painful as that may feel at times. Lets face it, if some unknown person posted this, it would have been ripped to shreds. ",

The cost for contractors therefore is generally quite a bit higher than what you might normally see on a typical job posting, and DAO participants should take that into account. The cost for a normal W-2 employee is much higher to a company than the nominal compensation, but the company eats those additional administrative and tax costs. Anyone looking to become a contributor should factor the additional costs of not only being self-employed, but also working in an uncertain legal environment and navigating a constantly changing DAO political system. MKR holders should understand that contributors are taking large personal risks both legally and politically, and there\u2019s really no job security for contributors, as any anon can make a forum post to offboard a core unit. The DAO needs to acknowledge the uncertainty that contributors are facing and compensate accordingly. ",

Doo is really the only delegate taking the initiative to ask direct questions that allow the community to get more information on this proposal request   To give a response. I don\u2019t see the value in repeating arguments already brought forth and in this thread I think @Doo_StableLab has done a good job of providing pushback on the proposal. For my own part I think that we should be very wary of onboarding any CU which has a primary marketing/public relation focus without having a dedicated marketing CU in place with an agreed upon marketing strategy. For marketing to work there needs to be some sort of idea being communicated. We need to get a sense of what Maker is what we want to be, what sort of problem we\u2019re trying to solve and what kind of people or organizations we want to do business with. Lacking such a unifying CU I fear resources spent on marketing is at best inefficient and at worst counterproductive. As a conclusion I think the timing of this proposal is not the best and it should probably be put back on the shelf for a while. ",

I have a nice background on advisory teams orientated to improve & develop new ways to approaching the potential of working units (team onboarding,consolidation & develop, KPI/OKR/MoS, platforms balance, work flows, cash flows & some sort of things relatives) all of it in accord to the normatives. So I\u2019m here offering my help to you to improve your offer. I have some thoughts on what you can do to make it and it will be my pleasure if you have 5 minutes to explain my vision & ideas to you, feeling you bro on the commitment and efforts that you and @kat are putting on this endeavor. Let me join you, bringing my time & experience to reach out a strong proposal that surely will make the community happy. Regards from the south! @aburban90 ",

I agree with @justincase that we need to define a strategy first, and the best way to do that is with a dedicated marketing CU within which it can work.     flipflopflapdelegate:  Risk is real folks, and when taking on that much risk, you should be compensated properly.   Ok, realistic compensation for real risk-taking should be given, but you can\u2019t expect protocol alone to bear the risk in a commercial CU. No ROI is given, it\u2019s all about costs nothing about expected revenue and growth. @aburban90 This CU differs in its ability to generate its own revenue. If you can sell your swags well, you can generate fatty revenue for yourself, but you have to work first, figure out where, how, how much, and most importantly, what you\u2019re going to sell. The trail already trodden a bit, so maybe there\u2019s something to start with. If I may suggest something, as for your costs, it\u2019s best to ask for a modest amount of salary. But in return, say, you keep most or even 100% of your revenue for a certain amount of time, and then, as time goes on, you gradually start giving more of your gaining profits to Maker, up to a certain threshold. If I remember correctly, Coulter got 50-50% as a test, so I don\u2019t think that would be a bad offer. I think after detailed elaboration, this could be the kind of business model that the community would be happy to accept. If your proposal is accepted and you reopen the business, I will be happy to work with you to set up the business in the EU. ",

I\u2019ve been working on a revision, which I will be posting soon for further feedback. For now, I\u2019m significant;y slashing across the board to make the budget more digestible for the DAO. In a previous life, I used to be an engineer. Budgeting projects was something I spent a lot of my time doing. Traditionally,  at least in my personal experience\u2026  best practice is to over-budget (within reason) and account for slack. Generally, I\u2019ve learned that completing a project below budget is overall a better look than pricing razor-thin then constantly issuing change orders to seek additional funding as predictably unpredictable issues inevitably show up. Still, I understand that these are trying times for the DAO and the market in general, so I don\u2019t want my ultimate proposal to have such a sticker shot. I\u2019m yet to prove myself as fully capable of achieving everything I\u2019ve proposed. So, given that, I\u2019ve been revising down to something more appropriate until I can show traction.   ",

No ROI is given, it\u2019s all about costs nothing about expected revenue and growth.   Where is this same analysis on the notional D3M signal request? This is my same and accurate concern with the notional SR. Unilateral risk, unclear ROI, no cost projections, no negotiation, no terms to even discuss or negotiate on\u2026 No RFC\u2026.?? Notional didn\u2019t even prepare an MIP for us, any costs, nor they honestly analyze risks. The SR doesn\u2019t have any cost projections because that would lay bare the unilateral risk. This should be mandatory and done through an MIP. That SR has a rough approximation (guesstimate) on ROI,  assuming we extend a 10mm dollar loan at todays rates. It wants a full bore commitment to implement using a signal  request. Without \u201ccosts\u201d it is impossible to do a cost benefit\u2026 Doesn\u2019t it seem strange to commit without using the MIP process or having any terms and costs to discuss and negotiate on? I think the RFC is to the benefit and help the Maker community and CU better align and collectively determine strategy. This proposal is a good example of that. Just saying, if you are going to push back on unilateral risk, Maker is being asked to take much worse unilateral risk in other situations that are purely for other benefit of other commercial counter parties. It would be nice to see some honest even handed analysis across all proposals. The protocol and governance doesn\u2019t need to be protected against burban first and SHCU who are working in good faith, but instead commercial counter-parties looking to exploit our governance. Our core units will prepare appropriate budgets when given the appropriate feedback. If not, they don\u2019t get voted through because they are using the MIP process. MIPS are resilient and appropriate for serious commitments. ",

These are also different service providers and not necessarily appropriate to compare roles across domains. Looking at SHCU\u2013 SHCU proposal contains favorable and deterministic unwind terms which offsets DAO risk. SHCU has a demonstrable track record which has never received any comp for their services. SHCU can provide more transparent costs and expense reports \u2013 more so than any other CU if required. However, we should keep standard transparency expectations across public good CU \u2013 an even hand. Accountable is a service provider which many CU have used and is inefficient/opportunistic but not unique to this proposal; 10k is actually reasonable looking at the global proposed budget compared to other CU. The question is simply, in the absence of a strong brand presence, and a desire to move more deeply into marketing, do we give Burban a year to keep going and re evaluate then. This would leave us a year to coordinate brand, swag, and some form of content prod, or do we cut him off now and leave us in a marketing vacuum? There is no \u201cright\u201d answer but seeking to find something that works seems to make more sense than create unnecessary conflict. We are just starting to find our footing and direction with RWA and Marketing, it would be nice to orient everyone and move together toward that goal. ",

Long vesting cliff with the ability to unwind at 12 months places a near 0 MKR risk on the DAO. Compensation beyond 70k Dai (below industry comparables) is contingent on extended initial cliff (18 months) and continued performance. These terms are not found anywhere else and solely to the benefit of MakerDAO. I will not comment on the specific events budget, but they received Dai compensation that is above intra-industry comparables. Based on their past performance, they deserve it, and the expectation is that they continue to progress and push their event quality higher and higher to merit an additional MKR budget. Each arrangement is unique, and needs to be examined holistically, including past performance, proposed terms, present status, and a desired future. Only then can we choose an appropriate strategy to reach the objective. Fixating on one deal term and contrasting across distinct and unrelated arrangements is unlikely to produce the analysis or results we want. ",

Yes it is expensive which is not ideal but they do solve many issues I am facing at the moment.  I am currently trying to find a solution that does not involve a a service like this.  There is massive risk and tax issues with recieving DAI and converting to fiat.

The compensation I\u2019m requesting can be viewed as a stipend.   I am questioning whether having a part-time role is needed. Many organizations in the space do not have a specific team focusing on creating swags. And if there\u2019s a need for design, it might be better to outsource considering such needs are not consistent. Also, for the facilitator role, maybe the salary is understandable. But for the part-time role, I am not sure how you are able to state \u201cwell below market rates\u201d with such confidence. This salary is higher than Maker Growth team and other non-technical CUs (and their travels don\u2019t get covered). I mean think about it, if part time is $60k, then it means if it was full time, would been $120k, how many jobs pay $120k for making swags and transporting them?  Regarding swag, you also ask for one time payment for restocking.      aburban90:  To do this, I need to invest in a small inventory, which I anticipate lasting a while. Depending on variety and quantity, restocking may cost around $35,000-$50,000. The budget includes a one-time distribution of 50,000 DAI to meet this need.   I want to clarify if it \u201clasting a while\u201d, what\u2019s the reasoning for also asking for 80k swag this cycle?  I afraid that this doesn\u2019t make sense. This is 6666 per month on operations. Even if if you deduct AccountAble, it\u2019s 10k per quarter that is spent on operations. Is it possible to point out some other big costs regarding this category?      aburban90:  Ongoing Operations:  Operational Overhead AccountAble: $10,000 TokenTax Software Grammarly Other Subscriptions Miscellaneous Costs    ",

                    "content": "Hello, I\u2019d like to provide my observations. There\u2019s been some great discussion recently on the forums about budget governance and what we can learn from corporate board mechanisms (here, here, and here). I think in sum those insights run against having Strategic Happiness as a core unit. My main takeaway from the discussions on board work was that corporate board members have to make very simple choices with a well understood interface. Either support the CEO or get rid of the CEO base on financial statements and qualitative exec discussions, and everything else you can do as a board member accelerates growth, but won\u2019t be influential enough to outweigh the CEO\u2019s choices. My sense is that the analogous situation for us is that Core Units, their budgets, and their key personnel are the interface and decision making arena. And our policy making tools are pretty blunt adjustments to the budget and personnel. To me, the conversation in this thread indicates the very simple tools we should be using are not sufficient for us to have confidence in this core unit as it is presented. This detailed dissection of budget items was justified due to issues in the proposal, but was also a waste of time and should not need to happen. Related to this, many folks have pointed out that we should be trying to have core units justify themselves in terms of revenue contribution. This is critical to the governance decision making interface because without having some sort of relatively quantifiable benefit (revenue, $ saved vs. outsourcing, etc.), it\u2019s very difficult to have coherent conversations about the appropriate budget at the MKR governance level with the blunt tools at hand. The discussion on this MIP is evidence of that in the total misalignment of the initial expenses with the perceived value. To me, it seems like swag would do better as a subset of another core unit that is more directly tied to revenue or outcomes. Making judgements about how much $$ to spend on swag and related stuff seems like a waste of MKR governance\u2019s time because it\u2019s so indirectly tied to revenue, very difficult to reason about, and really should be thought of in the context of a larger marketing/PR strategy. I feel like I would expect some key sr. person in another core unit to be developing this budget as a tactical decision in response to market feedback. That person will still be exposed to important governance pressure to contain costs in this area as a part of their overall budget. This also aligns generally what @JustinCase mentioned above:     JustinCase:  For my own part I think that we should be very wary of onboarding any CU which has a primary marketing/public relation focus without having a dedicated marketing CU in place with an agreed upon marketing strategy. For marketing to work there needs to be some sort of idea being communicated. We need to get a sense of what Maker is what we want to be, what sort of problem we\u2019re trying to solve and what kind of people or organizations we want to do business with. Lacking such a unifying CU I fear resources spent on marketing is at best inefficient and at worst counterproductive.   In my view, the kind of back and forth on this MIP indicates that future governance discussions around this core unit will continue to be a time suck, when there are more important things to tackle. Clearly @aburban90 does great work, but in my opinion he would be more empowered to focus on his strengths as a part of another core unit rather than run his own, and MKR holders would benefit from less governance overhead.

I think we should really consider if we really need 1,5 people working only with swag (I am ignoring the memes here, as I do not believe that constitutes any form of employment). Having an assistant makes no sense to be honest. If you are not able to do this task alone, I am not sure you should move forward with it.  Based loosely on previous events and depending on a given event\u2019s size:  Approximate cost per event: $20,000-$35,000+ Reach: 500-2000+ people   Having ordered swag myself without any optimisation I am confused by how you are able to spent 200-400 USD per person for swag at an event. Can you please publish your quotes and quality for what you are getting so we can compare it to other providers? In these quantities you should be able to achieve significant discounts, and prize optimise to get a lot more value per dollar spend. I would also say you can easily focus on higher impact items like t-shirts and hoodies, which I have gotten quotes for, without any discount, to 12-15 USD per t-shirt and 30-33 USD per sweatshirt including shipping. I hope everyone thinks long and hard if we need something like this at the moment. We are entering what could be long periods with significantly lower revenue, and in my opinion, we should only invest in the growth and security of the protocol. If a core unit does not significantly address either of those I don\u2019t think we should fund it. Does the SH CU really do that? The budget seems obscurely large for this type of operation. It feels like there is close to zero optimization in the proposal, and it does not translate into any of the things we should be focusing on in a tough market. At current Eth A stability fee we would need to have around 34,200,000 Dai debt open to finance this operation (without MKR vesting). I wonder why none of the other core units have wanted to include this in their own proposals?

Recent thoughts being shared (some alluded to in this thread) about refining the framework to vet, onboard and govern existing and future CU\u2019s, seem to agree that operations should be combined when it is beneficial to MKR holders, Contributors and productivity. This proposal is emblematic of when a CU should be part of an existing one. Planning events and the swag that will be distributed at them should be done together to enjoy cost efficiencies in shipping, ordering and strategy (i.e. theme/venues). Contributors can benefit from having a shared strategy that they can execute on while leveraging each other\u2019s skills to achieve the mandate of that CU. CU expenses like \u201cAccountable\u201d, which has been mentioned as a necessary cost, could be shared under one subscription within a core unit instead of costlier 1 off subscriptions. Having frameworks to more easily identify a value added to an existing CU is really important and will save the community time parsing out proposals based on \u201cI like this concept/team behind it\u201d vs \u201cwhere and how should this fit\u201d?

I know that I haven\u2019t published my expenses yet. It\u2019s been hard tracking down some of the older invoices, but I have something almost ready to submit after working with accountable. I am aware that there has been low cost optimization in what I\u2019ve been doing. It can be optimized down the road. Still, I believe the swag people get from me leaves an unquantifiable lasting positive impression of Maker and Dai.     Gustav_Arentoft:  12-15 USD per t-shirt and 30-33 USD per sweatshirt including shipping.   This is approximately what I have been spending more recently on items. The socks are about 9-12 USD, hats/beanies about $12-16. T-shirts I\u2019m sure are in the same price range. These are items to hand out at larger events and probably priced reasonably. The t-shirts and hoodies in the past that I\u2019ve paid for, from the official swag shop, there was no bulk option. So, I did pay retail prices for those. Some of the more expensive items, though, reserved for people within our community\u2026 like the Northfaces or backpacks (distributed as best as I could), yes, will cost much more, even in bulk. Transporting a lot of these things is where costs can run-up. If it\u2019s across borders, there can be VAT blockers. Recently, rented a van to drive from NYC, packed to the brim, to deliver swag for students at the Harvard conference. If it\u2019s shipping an individual package, those have been pretty expensive, so I\u2019ve been looking to do things in bulk (like at our larger events). Sometimes, it\u2019s cheaper to have something produced locally before an event. Maybe it can all be optimized better under a more macro marketing CU, but as it stands, we don\u2019t have that, and I\u2019ve been looking to fill that void, to date, largely out of my own pocket. What\u2019s important to me is to continue being a part of this community and delivering value where I can. This CU is not purely about swag. I also help the Growth CU in finding other projects we can work together with\u2026 sparking discussions & maintaining personal relationships with others in the space.

I don\u2019t wish for it to pass purely on that merit alone, but I want to assure the DAO that I\u2019m not seeking to squander or run away with the money. Currently, it looks like it will pass\u2026 but I will be setting up a multi-sig for extra security on the funds. If what I\u2019m doing proves to be so wasteful towards the end of the year\u2026 then, I can return any unused funds. Maybe I\u2019ll find another place to remain part of this community. ",

If this is the standard that we accept for large budgets going forward even in the current downturn market, this will set a precedence that drains the protocol\u2019s resources.

Happy you bring up this point - I\u2019d like to emphasize I tried to make sure any personal relationship does not influence my thoughts. I actually do think it is a reasonable proposal - but this is heavily influenced by past performance by @aburban90 . Someone not as tied to the community and not already having a track record would have no chance of getting this proposal through the process. We have already seen a lot of his work - he is doing it quite some time now. This Budget Modification is about bringing the CoreUnit to a higher level of accountability - the facilitator will need to fix accounting and get a proper structure. I was actually thinking someone who is doing the books would be the best for a part-time assistant  The budget itself gives the CoreUnit enough wiggle room - once there is a proper accounting in place we will all feel a lot better about it. Given the relatively low salary the vesting of 250MKR is a good compensation from my point of view. If this proposal is approved, we have 12 months to realize it was a bad idea and wind down at low costs - but I am certain Andrew will do a great job and we will all be happy ",

As we all know, this budget proposal is not purchasing naming rights to a baseball stadium while 99% of the team\u2019s fans have not ever heard of TerraLabs, UST, or care to learn about such product. It dwarves it in comparison to the money committed by Crypto companies who have signed deals with the sports industry, probably worth over 1 Billion USD as of today. I personally as a sports fan have been asking for MakerDAO to sign a deal with a sports team since 2020. If you scan through the deprecated Maker Rocket Chat, you will read that I suggested acquiring the naming right to stadiums, and sponsorships of sports teams, including using the name \u201cDAI Stadium\u201d.  Unfortunately FTX beat MakerDAO to the punch, followed by many others. Now, realistically I knew that it was not possible, the Maker Foundation was not going to listen to a random pleb\u2019s suggestion. But I understood that DAI \u201cBranding\u201d was non-existent. If I wore a DAI t-shirt in 2020 to Times Square, NYC not one single soul would have recognize the brand. Today, maybe 2 people will because they follow someone on Crypto-Twitter. Progress is being made and we shouldn\u2019t take our foot off the pedal. With USDT losing its position as the prefer stablecoin for trading desks to USDC, MakerDAO has a giant opportunity to position DAI as the premier decentralized stablecoin of DeFi. This budget is not asking for the DAO to fly 100 Lunatics to a crypto conference. It\u2019s asking this DAO to fund an individual who\u2019s willing to go the extra mile, most of the time solo if necessary, to keep the crypto community aware that MakerDAO and DAI are brands to be reckon with. And maybe you\u2019re right and it\u2019s gloom and doom for the foreseeable future. But if there ever was a need to spread love, then spreading love & happiness during another crypto winter is the right time.

On the other hand, losing valuable contributors who have been loyal for around 6 years, mostly unpaid, isn\u2019t great either. I\u2019ve been backchanneling to try and shape this a bit, but haven\u2019t crossed the schedules yet to assist where possible. I think FBL vote reasoning is still sound \u201cdon\u2019t vote on things where you know the team because, well, it\u2019s a conflict of interest.\u201d      Feedblack Loops LLC Delegate Platform (FBL)   Reasoning: Burban has personally given me gifts that make my family jealous. Supporting a budget with that much of a personal connection is not the best use of FBL\u2019s vote. While we endorse the humans behind this proposal, we worry about the expense cap here and hope that the team rises to occaison.    @aburban90 awhile back I expressed to you in DM\u2019s, the real value of swag was supercharging the shop and doing a rev share so you could justify whatever MKR budget felt right (alongside strategic patience vesting; yeah, let\u2019s call it that  : ) As of now, the concern is this budget is hard to justify and sets you up for significant struggles ( which no one wants). I dislike pointing these details out but it\u2019s the honest truth. Rising to the occasion looks like:  Clean reporting on expenses, regularly. Aiming to reduce costs where possible. Getting some version of \u201cself-serve\u201d swag going for the community. Flying around the world and delivering swag is awesome but it should be rare IMHO instead of the crux of the whole thing. Your time is valuable and it should command a premium. Would love to see IRL swag drops become something special. Should this pass, tackling concerns in this thread head on. I know you won\u2019t let this community down because you and @flipflopflapdelegate have basically matching MKR-trauma-bonded tattoos by this point.   A nonconventional option     aburban90:  definitely some overlap in what our CU\u2019s do.   Another wild idea should things become worse:  why not merge? Based on the pushback here and the consistent reporting gap it seems like a possible best win for the future is to merge your swag responsibilities with growth or events. This would allow for more flexibility on your end while tightening up the swag operations, reporting, and budgeting. ",

You can be all be sure I\u2019ll be throwing the most lavish $700k secret party for myself with the DAO\u2019s money!    More seriously, though, if it passes and I just find that I\u2019m in over my head\u2026 I\u2019ll return the unused funds. Maybe I\u2019ll join Growth\u2026 or Risk ( Looove risk ) If it doesn\u2019t pass\u2026  maybe I\u2019ll do another SR for a small nominal amount to hold me over while I revise or decide if there is another CU I should join\u2026 or\u2026 \u2026 another project entirely???  One last point\u2026 I heard murmurs (that I ofc disregard)\u2026 $500k may have been sensible\u2026 $700k is just too much!  If it passes, then\u2026 I\u2019ll hold a forum poll for whether or not $50k/Q should go towards buying MKR on the market and looking at them in the voting contract. ",
