As a Uniswap holder I feel less incentivized to keep my UNI or purchase more knowing that people will be receiving UNI at the prices we\u2019ve helped maintain and will most likely plummet the price. I\u2019m not really supportive of anymore Airdrops at all. People will keep coming up saying that for some reason it\u2019s not fair they didn\u2019t get free tokens. It will be very hard to keep everyone happy. If you want to get UNI, you would need to support the ecosystem in some way, like buying and holding your tokens, participating in governance and LP. I feel that would be the most fair approach. NO MORE AIRDROPS ",
