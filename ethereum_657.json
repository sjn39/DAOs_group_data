You don\u2019t have to accept the Constantinople fork for example, but rejecting it involves proposing an alternate fork to at least delay the difficulty block. There\u2019s a lot of momentum behind \u201cdo nothing\u201d which makes it very difficult to continue to improve and evolve unless there\u2019s some balancing function and the difficulty bomb is that forcing function. We may however want to be more generous in how long we extend it as part of each hard fork so the time pressure is reduced. ",

                    "content": "To all the people who are saying that the difficulty bomb makes sure miners have incentive to upgrade their node. If you think about this one for a bit more, you might conclude that the reason miners do upgrade their code ahead of the release is not to avoid the bomb (which might only start having effect in a few weeks), but to avoid mining the fork that has no value (which will start hitting the bottom line the moment miner wants to sell some mined ETH). I said it before and I will say again - miners will not \u201crebel\u201d against developers unless there is someone funding alternative group of developers who will continue maintaining their fork. And if there is an alternative group of developers, they will love to defuse the bomb as the first \u201cjob\u201d. The fact that the upgraded side of the fork has a backing of entities like EF and ConsenSys gives that side more value than the non-upgraded one, because these entities can help fund maintenance and further development of the protocol for the years to come. The utility of the bomb in forcing the miners to upgrade is IMO a big red herring. Now to another proposition - that the bomb forces developers to do something. This is closer to the truth. Although, it would say, when it comes to protocol development, many times it is better to do nothing that to do \u201csomething\u201d. It might sound harsh, but many changes made in the protocol over the last two years are non-essential and low impact. Some more difficult but higher impact changes (like account abstraction) were dropped from the release plan because there would not be enough time to get them ready before the bomb. So it is not so very black and white to me that the bomb is still useful, but I am happy for it to stay if others feel really strongly about it and it makes them more comfortable  ",

Allegorically speaking, Two men are in a dry desert. One has access to a well, the other doesn\u2019t. The men with the well helps the other man in by giving small amounts of water. Well gradually he want to move on and stop having him so dependent on him. So first he\u2019ll give him less and less water till One day he decides he no longer want to help the man. But rather than no longer giving him sips of water he decides to splash the water in his face. Well if he does this enough that the man then leaves in search of water, or better yet a nicer person. The problem comes down to time-line. I would vote for a slow-gradual increase in difficulty over the course of 2 years or the time-line for PoS. That\u2019s currently up in the air, as far as I know, so there should not be a built in time until the Eth Dev\u2019s agree to a strict time-frame release for PoS. ",

Whether that\u2019s a forcing function on the miners or the developers or some combination of both or neither doesn\u2019t really matter. It keeps the code moving forward. My concern is that diffusing the bomb has been conflated with lowering the block reward. Think about it. For the Byzantium fork, people used the fact that the increased difficulty (which effectively lowered the block reward over a given time frame) necessitated lowering the per-block reward from five to three. The same argument was made for Constantinople to lower the reward from three to two. Unless they\u2019re arguing that the difficulty bomb was part of the original monetary policy, this makes no sense (particularly because the actual hard fork date is totally at the whim of the core devs). The bomb is great because it forces forward movement. It\u2019s bad when people use it to justify completely arbitrary decisions to lower the block reward. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I actually support the lowering of the reward, just not when it\u2019s justified arbitrarily by the difficulty bomb. I don\u2019t think the bomb was ever intended to be part of the monetary policy of the chain. But, let\u2019s don\u2019t start a whole conversation about that. bomb good \u2013 using it to justify arbitrary monetary policy bad. ",
