What are the main legal risks when it comes to Dai stable coin? And how many currencies are there that users can use as collateral? Any guidance would be helpful. ",

The main one for Dai holders would be that one of the blacklistable collaterals is frozen, leaving Dai holdeds unable to withdraw it.
