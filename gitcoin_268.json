Login with Gitcoin Passport \u00b7 Issue #759 \u00b7 gitcoinco/passport \u00b7 GitHub   Hey, thanks for the suggestion! Right now we\u2019re going full speed ahead on the optimization of Passport itself and the launch of our Grants protocol. There are many experiments on the way to implement Passport but the execution on this lies with the developers of the various projects. This forum runs on Discourse, so for now we are limited to what is possible with Discourse. Hopefully in the future they\u2019ll add Passport as an option, we\u2019d like this very much of course  Note, if you want to push projects to integrate with passport, all info can the SDK can be found here ",

For the Passport part, I don\u2019t immediately see the \u201cLogin with Gitcoin Passport\u201d scenario in the SDK, so I suppose it yet had to be written, but the part about reading identity looks like something that might work Integrating Passport in your DApp - Gitcoin Passport I am pretty much interested in pushing the project of integrating Gitcoin Password with in this board sustainable way. Might even say that sustainable way is my primary motivation for pushing it. So figuring out what the budget is, how to allocate it, how to spend, how valuable is this feature for the DAO and if the budget matches the value - I am interested to know how these things are done.
