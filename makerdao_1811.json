                    "content": " Q3 2022 MKR Decentralization, Delegation, and Distribution Update Commentary on data as of September 30, 2022 (embedded views will auto refresh with updated data). All views exclude Maker-owned addresses that hold MKR. Addresses known to be owned by a single entity are lumped together. Following is a high level summary of selected MKR governance and decentralization metrics:  1792\u00d7490 134 KB  Charts through time of each of these metrics are explored throughout this post. . With the exception of the metrics around number of holders, most of these metrics decreased QoQ. One of the themes here is that, for the first time, delegate contracts have expired and some MKR is still left in them, as shown here:  This can be seen as a measure of how much delegated MKR represents delegators that are too passive in their governance participation to notice that they should re-delegate. A second theme, as shown in the following views, is that there seems to be a long term trend of direct participation shifting to participation via delegation, whether the top MKR holder is included or not:   . The count of total governance participants of at least 1 MKR has been steadily increasing, but trended slightly downward QoQ. The same trend can be observed in count of delegators of at least 1 MKR, and this staving off is likely due to some delegators falling off of this list due to expired contracts. Meanwhile, the count of direct governance participants (as defined by addresses who sent at least 1 MKR directly to the governance contract) has been steadily declining as participation biases toward delegation:  While validated delegate count (delegates with more than one delegator) has been fairly flat lately, total delegate count has continued to increase:  . The number of MKR holders with at least 1 token has been increasing since May 2022:  The amount of top wallets/entities it would take to comprise 50% of available MKR holdings has continued its steady uptrend, representing increased MKR token decentralization:  A measure of inequality of a distribution, typically used in income distributions, is the Gini Coefficient. Complete inequality is represented as a score of 100, whereas complete equality is represented as a score of 0. The current gini coefficient is 96.68, which represents a high level of inequality. This figure was 96.74 at the time of the last check-in on July 14th, so by this measure, decentralization has slightly improved.  . Conclusion  There is a long term governance trend of direct participation shifting to participation via delegation For the first time ever, there is a fair amount of MKR in expired delegated contracts The number of participants of 1MKR+ represented in governance contract has been steadily increasing but trended slightly downward QoQ We have seen slight increases in MKR decentralization since last quarter  These metrics can be found in this dashboard, which has been updated to include delegation views, or in this post. .
