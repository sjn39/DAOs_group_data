Regardless of what the responses are there will be some ares weaker than others and we don\u2019t have a CU that\u2019s really well suited for addressing the problems. GovAlpha fits to some extent, but our job as a neutral party also means we\u2019re upholding proposals (like offboardings and budget cuts) that go against the CUs.

They care about (1) because of liability and (2) because they just want to know whether they are going to have to replace someone.   As a freelance consultant no-one cared at all about how I felt working for them because I could be replaced at the drop of a hat if I complained.   I guess at $200+/hr no-one wants to hear your whining, just go find another client/job. If anyone is going to do a survey make sure to ask some basic status questions.  How old are you? (age bracket answers) Are you M/F or other? Do you have higher education degrees? a) How many? b) Highest level. How long have you worked for the DAO? Are you an employee or consultant? How did you find out about MakerDAO?  Then a few survey questions that come to mind which could give some indications about how a person feels about their job.  Is your compensation, below market, at market, or above market in your opinion? If you were laid off tomorrow do you feel you could find another job with comparable compensation and benefits Is it harder or easier working for MakerDAO than your past employment Is your supervisor a person or the DAO?

Does your job require you to have formal hours? If there was one single thing MakerDAO could do to help you better succeed both at performing your job and being productive at your job what would that be? Rank how much MakerDAO governance affects you in your job (0 - not at all, 5 - completely dependent on governance actions for good or bad) List specific workplace issues you would like to see addressed.
