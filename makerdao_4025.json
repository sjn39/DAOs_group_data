I wonder why it takes so long for devs to finalize how other currencies will work and to release a roadmap for that. ",

This is a super post and it would need to be set as a priority task i also think . Keep in mind that, expanding is demanding in term or effort, communication, relation with partner\u2019s, time-demanding and most of them monetary issue.We also need to consider right now is the holiday\u2019s period, but still a good timing because most of the people have festive mind right now and are off-work. But doing a world expansion is something that is taking time but will happen of course. This need to be seriously revised and taking care off but with the good person that are already working on the project. ",

                    "content": "@balupton Yes, this is great i think. While DAI is and will always be equivalent to the US dollars , is it good news for many people and they will always say in their mind that they have no loss value if they don\u2019t spend now or later. There is a part where we don\u2019t really have power to push things up but it\u2019s getting there. More BTC Atm and more and more business or restaurants and stores have a BTC machine where you can do easy transaction. Good for trader\u2019s also i think you can play from different point of view and not risking your money with stablecoin if aware of a incoming downvalue and good for Mister and Miss who can use them on a daily routine.
