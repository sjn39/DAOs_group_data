                    "content": "The first Vault Compensation Plan failed to pass by a vote of 25k against to 17k in favor. This revised compensation plan incorporates feedback received in the forums since the first vote, and seeks to make the process simpler while avoiding impacting DAI liquidity. A google docs version of the revised plan v2 is available here. I and the rest of the working group would greatly appreciate any feedback!  Compensation Plan v2 Pursuant to the on-chain \u201cVault Compensation poll\u201d 62k yes to 33k no that passed 4/6/2020, we hereby submit a compensation plan for approval by MKR holders. MKR Holder Declaration This compensation plan constitutes a proposal for a compromise and settlement of claims from vault owners in respect of the circumstances underlying the vault compensation poll referenced above. No action taken by the persons drafting or implementing this compensation plan, either previously or in connection with this compensation plan shall be deemed or construed to be: (a) an admission of the truth or falsity of any claims heretofore made or (b) an acknowledgment or admission by any such persons of any fault or liability whatsoever to vault owners or to any third party. The present loss compensation plan is without prejudice to any rights or interests of the individuals drafting or executing this compensation plan and any position that any such person may take in legal or administrative proceedings and addresses certain specific circumstances where MKR holders may volunteer to provide certain compensation to vault holders. The persons drafting or implementing this compensation plan maintain that MKR holders have no obligation to issue any compensation for losses, and volunteer to implement this plan solely at their discretion. Goals and principles  Completeness - Ideally this process should address all outstanding claims for compensation. Fairness - Similarly situated users should receive similar levels of compensation. Consensus - Giving MKR voters the ability to choose key parameters will help ensure that the final executive vote has the support necessary to pass. Simplicity - Minimizing the governance overhead and time involved in agreeing on and executing the plan. Economic Soundness - Using MKR for compensation reduces pressure on DAI liquidity and the peg, while potentially minimizing impact of collateral price movements for vaults receiving compensation  Overview of compensation process Vaults that were liquidated at auction or self-liquidated their positions between 3/12/2020 12:00 UTC and 3/13/2020 13:40 UTC will be considered for compensation; liquidations falling outside of this time period do not qualify. Compensation amounts for ETH vaults that were liquidated at auction shall be determined based upon the \u201ctab change in relation to collateral change\u201d calculation method, and the compensation percentage chosen by MKR governance. Compensation will be distributed in the form of newly minted MKR, with the DAI to MKR conversion ratio fixed to the volume weighted average price of the FLOP auctions that took place in March. Once the compensation amount is determined, a smart contract will be created to administer the funds transfers. Vault owners not included in the initial compensation class (BAT vaults liquidated at auction and ETH or BAT vaults that self-liquidated) will have the opportunity to provide documentation to substantiate their claim, and receive compensation at the rate determined by governance. Vault holders shall be required to issue a transaction to withdraw compensation to their account, and compensation will only be made available to the address associated with the vault. Changes from Previous Plan Proposal The initial Vault Compensation Plan Approval Poll failed by a vote of 25k to 17k. Some of the feedback received in the forums following the vote suggested that the amount of governance overhead and number of votes involved may have been a negative for some voters. This revised plan document seeks to slip down the governance voting process in the hopes that this may gain more support. Additionally, there is concern that auctioning MKR to get the necessary DAI for compensation would have negative macroeconomic consequences. This revised plan proposes to compensate vaults in MKR. Vault owners can then hold the MKR or swap to their preferred asset without impacting DAI liquidity. The specific changes:  Eliminating poll to confirm compensation method / reference price  Moving forward with the \u201cTab change in relation to collateral change\u201d method simplifies the governance selection process   Combining the initial plan approval poll with the compensation percentage poll as a ranked choice vote  The poll structure should make it easier to differentiate between MKR voters who oppose a particular compensation plan and others who oppose any vault compensation Poll also gives approval to include funding request in a subsequent executive vote Scheduled for 1-2 week voting period instead of 3 days to allow greater turnout   Run funding for both operating expenses and compensation payments through a single executive vote  Drawback - some operating expenses (e.g. contract development) would need to be paid in arrears   Compensation will be distributed to vaults in MKR instead of DAI  The compensation amount will be the DAI value determined by the \u201ctab change in relation to collateral change\u201d compensation method, with the DAI to MKR exchange rate fixed as the volume weighted average price of the March FLOP auctions Payment for project work will be issued in DAI from system surplus    Proposed Stages Phase 0: Deliverables:  Plan document posted to forum for discussion and presented on governance call Need exact verbiage of on chain poll Obtain quotes for work necessary for compensation disbursement:  Smart contract development and audit Vault compensation analysis audit Payment for working group time up to this point Estimated cost for vault claims review and future working group time   Need total cost in MKR for each percentage option in poll (1), including ETH vault compensation, 50% extra for manual vault claims, and operating costs (in DAI)  Phase 1: Governance poll: (1) Vault Compensation Poll (ranked choice IRV voting)* ++Edit: Please refer to this post for an update to the compensation amounts listed below.  24.67% (theoretical maximum auction yield) 2880324DAI 11522MKR 21% 2402973DAI 9612MKR 18% 2023954DAI 8096MKR 15% 1652134DAI 6609MKR 12% 1298983DAI 5196MKR 9% 621152DAI 2485MKR 6% 305187DAI 1221MKR 3% 101715DAI 407MKR 0% (Reject Vault Compensation) Reject Plan (Support Vault Compensation)   DAI/MKR estimates above assume 66% participation and a conversion rate of 250DAI/MKR\u2026 Actual compensation may be .5 to 1.5x the above current numbers (when one includes BAT vaults and self liquidators and an unknown participation rate) but should not be outside of these limits unless participation is unusually high or low and the numbers of vaults seeking to be included is significantly higher than expected. The probability the actual amount or compensation needed is outside of these estimates is estimated to be less than 1%.  Poll 1 selects the compensation percentage to be applied to vaults. For options (a) through (h), the poll vote also approves including a request for MKR funding into a subsequent executive vote to cover compensation amounts as well as DAI disbursement to pay for predefined operational expenses. Those who support vault compensation in principle but object to the specifics of the plan can vote for \u201cReject Plan\u201d. Those who oppose compensation entirely can vote for \u201c0% (Reject Vault Compensation)\u201d. The poll will be a ranked choice vote Deliverables:  Work on compensation contract development Finalize manual claims processing procedure Set up multisig to control contract admin functions Audit contracts and compensation data Prepare executive vote  Phase 2 Executive vote: (2) Approve MKR funding for compensation claims and predefined DAI operating expenses Deliverables:  Ensure broad communication of compensation package and claims procedures to affected vaults and wider Maker community, including any terms of accepting offer, deadlines, or other restrictions  Create and distribute a press release explaining the claims process for vault owners: vaults with collateral available to claim in Oasis, Black Thursday ETH auctions, Black Thursday BAT auctions and self-liquidated vaults Coordinate comms with Maker community messaging team Work with Maker UI providers to communicate claims process (Oasis, DefiSaver, etc)   Disburse payment for outstanding development and working group expenses Receive manual claims for 30 days, and review within 60 days of receipt  Target for all claims to be completed within 90 days Governance can retrieve unclaimed funds from contract after this period has elapsed    Manual compensation: Claimants outside the initial compensation class can submit data to FORUM THREAD to substantiate their claim. For example, these claimants include  Vaults that self-liquidated BAT vaults  The compensation review team (i.e., Maker_man, felix, jpritikin, monetsupply, befitsandpiper, and any additional members) will review these data. If the claim checks out then the compensation team will add the claimant to the compensation smart contract to permit funds disbursement. The compensation team reserves the right to unilaterally decide whether a claim is valid or invalid. Claims posted more than 30 days from the beginning of the compensation period will not be considered. No appeals shall be entertained. All decisions are final and at the discretion of the compensation team. Phase 3: Executive vote: (3) Self-destruct the compensation contract and burn remaining unclaimed MKR Compensation should be claimed within approximately 90 days. Once this period has elapsed, Maker governance is free to remove any unclaimed MKR from circulation. END.

Appendix: Icebox Potential options for Maker governance not included in proposed governance plan. In the event that the initial MKR poll to approve the compensation plan is rejected, the Maker community can signal which parts of the plan were contentious and potentially revisit some of the questions below.  Poll to confirm payment of compensation in MKR instead of DAI or ETH/BAT   A poll was developed to decide this question. However, during the drafting of this poll, it became clear that it is much simpler to compensate in DAI. Proposing to move forward with compensation in MKR because Maker does not currently have the ability to acquire collateral assets. Maker voters can instead use the tab compensation calculation method, and a DAI/MKR price based on the average FLOP auction clearing price from March 2020 Deciding to compensate with ETH/BAT will likely add substantial delays to the compensation process Compensating in DAI may negatively impact DAI liquidity and the peg   Poll to confirm compensation method and reference price  In the interest of simplicity, eliminating this poll and choosing to move forward with \u201ctab change in relation to collateral change method\u201d and conversion to MKR   Poll to determine/confirm the time bounds (start and end time) for vault auctions or self liquidations that will be covered by compensation plan  Proposing to move forward with vault inclusion criteria and start/end times from original Liquidation Report as discussed in the forums Based on initial analysis, it looks like the Black Thursday period (3/12/2020 12:00 to 3/13/2020 13:40, ETH auctions 763-4324) covers the vast majority of users who lost funds, and covers substantially all of the zero bid auctions as well as the worst of the Black Thursday price falls and gas spikes Possible counterargument: first and last 0% collateral return auctions near Black Thursday occurred at 3/12/20 8:00 UTC and 3/14/20 0:00 UTC, and last 0% collateral return auctions before auction freeze module and USDC were added occured by 3/16/20 13:00 UTC  Alternative time bounds would require additional analytical work, delaying issuance of compensation Additional auction selection criterion:  < N% tab recovered, Auction fetched < % some market price (only have OSM, uniswap markets, anything else need data which will delay compensation) Collateral returned was < some chosen nominal %     Some process to select or approve the compensation review team  To speed up the process, we propose that the team will be formed by the same people who drafted the plan. Some process can be added to the plan if the community feels like this is needed.   Appeal process for compensation review team decisions  To keep things simple, compensation review decisions shall be final and non-negotiable. If the community feels like there is need for an appeal process, this can be added but will increase complexity, time, and cost required to administer the plan.   Poll to approve compensating vaults that self-liquidated  Proposing to move forward with \u201cyes\u201d, based on principles of fairness and completeness above Users who took action to avoid liquidation likely saved MKR holders from additional bad debt, so it would seem unfair if these users ended up worse of than similar vault owners who allowed their positions to be liquidated   Poll to confirm using the same time bounds, reference price parameters, and compensation framework for self-liquidating vaults as for vaults that were liquidated by the system  Proposing to move forward with \u201cyes\u201d based on principle of equality If poll resolves to \u201cno\u201d, follow up work/polling may be required to set reference price and time bounds for these vaults or identify alternative compensation heuristics   Poll to confirm mechanics of compensation for vaults that were liquidated at auction  Option 1: Uniform minimum collateral return percentage for vaults within time bounds (1) - topping up any vaults that received less than agreed standard (current compensation analysis covers this) Option 2: Uniform premium/discount percentage versus VWAP of ETH/DAI or BAT/DAI  Need to determine the time used for valuing vault collateral (auctions don\u2019t settle instantly) Need to perform additional vault compensation analysis to determine overall and vault-by-vault compensation levels If we do any compensation that has a time element to determine some value then someone will need to choose what this means for compensation. Example liquidations happen in phases (tend, dent, deal) and these phases usually happen in different blocks. Someone will have to define what time we use to define a market price for this case so a time based value choice can be applied to existing data.   Option 3: Tab based compensation. Apply the nominal collateral return to determine a collateral return deficit to multiply the tab in DAI to determine DAI compensation. This option is by far easiest to calculate over all possible claimants but it fails to compensate directly for collateral value (option 1) Options 1 and 3 from this section have been incorporated into poll (2) to determine compensation method and price   Whether to suck the maximum possible compensation in a single executive or to spread it out over multiple executives  Spreading out the fund raising over multiple executives puts less pressure on the price of MKR from FLOP auctions. However, this approach has the danger that later tranches of funding may not be approved. Compensation funds could be exhausted and some otherwise eligible vault owners might not be compensated. Therefore, we will suck enough DAI in a single executive to pay all potential claims. Surplus DAI will be returned to the protocol after a suitable waiting period.   Whether to wait until the surplus account can fully fund this compensation plan to avoid FLOP auctions.  Appendix: Smart Contract Specification See https://github.com/jpritikin/BlackThurs Appendix: Q&A Q: Can we determine the asset reference price/compensation method and the auction refund percentage simultaneously? A: This would be unwise. These polls are mutually dependent. Intermediate vote results on one poll would change the probabilities on the other poll. Q: Could the compensation amount polls be run in the opposite order? A: Yes, but the proposed order seems easier for MKR holders to decide. It may be hard to decide the auction refund percentage without knowing the reference price. Q: Why wasn\u2019t the asset reference price poll initiated on May 11? A: Rich pointed out that signaling guidelines were not followed. Rich requested that more attention be put toward building consensus. For example, we should map out a complete plan before we run more polls. Q: Why do we need a smart contract to convey compensation? A: How else can it be done? Compensation will involve 100s of token transfers. It is not possible to batch all of these transfers into a single executive spell. A natural person could be nominated to issue the transactions, but what assurance do we have that the tokens will be transferred correctly? The total amount could be large. Who do we trust to handle that kind of cash? Q: Is requiring users accept a release to claim compensation useful or legally valid? A: We will draft the language as if it has legal force, but whether or not it has legal force is not important. The agreement is important because it educates that vault holders can either claim compensation or join as plaintiff in a legal action, but not both. Q: Will vault holders be able to interact directly with the smart contract as well or will interactions need to take place through the GUI? A: It is always possible to interact directly with a smart contract, but we will encourage invoking claim() from our static webpage that informs the claimant that claiming compensation causes them to waive the right to sue. Q: What benefits do we obtain from using a smart contract and asking vault holders to claim compensation? A: By requiring the vault holder to claim compensation, we ensure that they currently have an active wallet (that is, private key is not lost). In addition, we can stipulate that the act of claiming compensation waives the possibility of future litigation. Q: How do we handle the final executive vote to fund compensation contract if MKR voters decide to use a reference price based on when the compensation is issued? Depending on how long vote takes to pass, there is the potential for the market price drifting away from the intended reference price. A: The last opportunity to set the reference price is when the contract is created and address recorded for approval in the executive spell. That\u2019s why particular language is used in the reference price poll. Q: Where will the GUI to claim compensation be hosted? A: On github as a static web page. If we can get a domainname like march13claim.makerdao.com to point to our static web page, that will be great, but it\u2019s not required. Q: What is the Tab compensation plan (option 2d)? A: While going through claimants both within the BT plan proper and those who might be outside of the plan (self liquidators like vault 2288) we found that for most cases looking at the collateral change vs. the borrowed debt (TAB) change that it was easiest to value the damage in terms of the debt change as the Liquidation Ratio set by the borrower effectively determined the collateral value. In the loosest sense it makes more sense to value the compensation based on the amount borrowed since liquidation would occur based on the changing value of the collateral. The only change here is that we use the collateral return deficit to multiply the TAB change to determine compensation in DAI. Q: Define the collateral return deficit? A: If governance decides that compensation should be determined based on how much collateral was returned then one can uniformly apply this \u2018nominal collateral return\u2019 to the \u2018actual collateral returned\u2019 to create: Collateral return deficit = nominal collateral return (chosen by governance) - collateral returned Typically we look at this as a percentage because the theoretical return percentage is defined by the LR for the collateral type. Q: Can you give examples of application of compensation calculation method A: Using a nominal collateral return of 18% as a working example and value for poll option 2a at 100DAI/ETH, 2b at 240DAI/ETH, 2c = 170DAI/ETH Example 1: Self liquidator Example 2: 0-bid liquidated Vault 2288 3834 Before 5005ETH 100.1 After 585.18ETH 0 Collret 11.69% 0% Tab 423835.88 9049.466 Colldef 18-11.69%=6.31% 18% (.18-.1169)5005=315.8155ETH .18100.1=18.018ETH (DAI) (.18-1169)423835.88DAI=26744.04DAI .189049.466DAI=1628.90DAI Conversion to MKR at volume weighted average FLOP auction price from March (using ~250 DAI per MKR as a placeholder value for this example) Example 1 continued: Example 2 continued: 26744.04 / 250 = 106.976 MKR 1628.90 / 250 = 6.516 MKR Appendix: Working Group Payment Working Group rate of pay: 50 DAI per hour Hours worked to date:  Joshua Pritikin \u2013 40 Monet Supply \u2013 40 Maker Man \u2013 30 Felix \u2013 4 Befitsandpiper \u2013  Total outstanding working group time as of 6/15/2020: 114 hours Total outstanding working group payment as of 6/15/2020: 5700 DAI Future tasks requiring compensation:  Additional writing, analysis, and project management (working group)  Cost estimate: 3000 DAI   Create compensation smart contract (outside developer)  Cost estimate: 5000 DAI   Audit compensation smart contract (outside auditor)  Cost estimate: 5000 DAI   Review and process claims from BAT auctions and self-liquidated vaults (working group)  Cost estimate: 5000 DAI    Estimated total operating expenses: 23700 DAI ",

I for one voted \u201cyes\u201d for Comp. Plan v1\u2013which was against my better judgement. For one, as a non-believer of frivolous lawsuits, I am against the litigation brought against the Maker Foundation. This could have been settled IMO, within the community/ecosystem. Yet, I voted to give the CDP/Vault owners the benefit of the doubt, even tho in my heart I was against it. Another thing\u2013do we really believe the Whales/VC\u2019s are going to want to put their name behind any of these Compensation Plans? As an American\u2013I would not. IMO\u2013the American based Whales/VC\u2019s etc\u2013will not get involved. But I could be wrong\u2026 but if I\u2019m not\u2013how do you rally enough Executive Votes to get it approved? ",

Seems like the most fair way to do it. I\u2019d like to share some thoughts from a keeper\u2019s perspective so we can better arrive at compensation price that is fair for both MKR holders and btfo moonbois. I\u2019m going to start from the top number, and work downwards.   24.67% rarely happens. The exception being self liquidation or low number of auctions for keepers to compete. Black Thursday had a huge number of auctions, so that puts a higher premium on being a keeper. In single collateral DAI this premium was fixed at 3%. Usually, 3% was enough to clear the auctions quickly, but in times of extreme volatility (such as the USDT scare in early fall of 2018) there is historical precedent of 3% being an insufficient incentive to clear the liquidations. Even if we had hundreds of keepers, I would argue that the normal 3% incentive would have been pushed to something like 5-6% do to the insane volume of liquidations to process. So our bid is already down to 5-6% below spot.   There was a supply glut of DAI at the time. As a keeper, I need to be able to instantly arbitrage my profits to get the DAI back. After all, ETH could go to 20. Unlike the moonbois, I realize that and must derisk to get back into DAI. DAI was trading at +1.07 when I needed it most, so after slippage this is more like 7-8% that the moonbois will be paying for. Add this to the \u201ckeeper incentive\u201d I described above, that brings us to 12-14% below spot.   ETH was dropping so fast. DAI was mooning harder than ever. As a keeper, I need to bid low in case ETH keeps tanking/DAI keeps mooning by the time I can recapitalize. This is the hardest account to factor in, as each keeper has their own risk tolerance when it comes to exposure on the ETH/DAI pairing. I personally put this at additional 4-9% \u201ckeeper ratio risk\u201d which brings us to 16-23% below spot.   I hope this makes sense. Even if we had a flawless auction system, the bids still would have come in 16-23% below spot price. As first choice, I will be voting for:     monet-supply:   6% 305187DAI    Second choice:     monet-supply:   3% 101715DAI    Third choice:     monet-supply:   9% 621152DAI    Anything higher than option 6 is completely unjustified.

                    "content": "    equivrel:  Why is using the average MKR price from the March price auctions appropriate for this compensation plan?   I didn\u2019t choose this price but if we want to debate this I am happy to step up here because while I didn\u2019t come up with it I agree with the choice. The simplest way I can put this is with an example. Lets use vault2288 Guy self liquidated 4419.82ETH saving the system from another 400K DAI of 0-bid losses if he let his vault liquidate that would have had to be made up by subsequent MKR auctions at 250DAI/MKR approximately which would have cost the protocol an additional 1600 MKR!! He recovered 11.69% collateral while also saving the system 1600MKR or 400K DAI of losses.   If governance chooses 3,6,9% this guy gets no compensation. In the compensation plan example we assumed governance chose 18% for illustration purposes and this would have given this vault holder 26744DAI compensation or if we look at this in ETH it would have been 315.8155ETH. That ETH today would be worth approximately 126,000 US or about 124K DAI Using the current model if we took 18% in his DAI tab and paid out in MKR at 250DAI/MKR we\u2019d have 26744/250=106.976MKR (as in the example).   Right now this would fetch about 160ETH or only about 1/2 of the ETH compensation to make 18%.   So basically this person (even at 18% selection) would get ETH value return of about 15% (or about 3.5% more than the 11.69% he already has) and this is ONLY if governance chooses 18%. IF we had done this at current MKR Market prices this compensation would have come out at 26744/580=46MKR approx 70ETH or a real collateral return of about 13.1%. a far cry from the 18% collateral return and significantly lower than the 15% using 250DAI/MKR So the reason why we would use the 250DAI/MKR price is two fold.   In the end when used against the compensation % being in the DAI tab vs. collateral we make up for:  not compensating  in collateral (collateral with a DAI price at the time of liquidation is a far cry from the total value these vaults believe they have lost which is a value perceived in collateral that has since liquidation appreciated at least 3-4 fold) but also added compensation for having to wait for all of this and believing they probably are going to get nothing while watching ETH price climb 4 fold.  The goal here is to at least try to fairly offer compensation based on the percieved value lost even if it is going to come up significantly short.  Meaning if governance were to decide that 9% or 12% collateral value should have been returned and uses the above method to make up the shortfall NO VAULT will get back to the 9 or 12% of their vault collateral and hence also will have lost out on the opportunity cost of that collateral value increasing. The simplest way to put an answer to your question is that even at 250DAI/MKR and current MKR/ETH ratio this model is not going to make up the whole collateral difference even if 24.67% is chosen simply because ETH price has moved up so much since this event and using market price of MKR in DAI pretty much makes compensation at the 24.67% level easily refusable by vault holders.  Even at 24.67% and a MKRDAI price of 580 (.2467-.1169)*423835.88 = 55014DAI approx 95MKR = 142 ETH = 14.5%-11.69%=2.8% collateral compensation vs. 580/250 = 2.32 or 2.8% * 2.32  approx 6.5% on top of his 11.69 to give about 18% collateral return vs. the 24.67% governance selected as a compensation choice. Lastly governance gets to choose the compensation % value and given that most people (lix is a good example below) are going to want to return 3-9% using even 250DAI/MKR means only 500-2000 MKR will be offered in TOTAL to all of these vault holders.   Better than nothing to be sure, but a literal drop in the bucket here both in terms of real MKR dilution (even relative to the what approx 15,000 MKR that was sold to raise the 5.3M DAI at the time) and the real value of the ETH these vaults lost based on current ETH USD prices. One fact I want to point out.   It was the self liquidators that basically saved the system from significant additional MKR losses.   Guys like vault2288 should be getting a bonus compensation based on how much DAI losses they saved the system to reward people who were in great haste and with strong emotion were clearing their collateral to pay down debt during distressed markets and high gas prices, to try not just to save something for themselves, but also to save the system from literally giving away their collateral and eating greater losses.  They should not be getting punished because they salvaged collateral only to find because they didn\u2019t lose that much they get less compensation in a compensation plan than someone who did nothing.    Vault2288 I consider a Maker BT hero because of this.    He alone saved Maker in total as much MKR as will be offered to ALL vaults at the 6% level by self liquidating and almost 10% of the amount if 24.67% were offered. ",

Well everything is up for discussion and debate.  I totally encourage any and all feed back. You are completely correct in that any polls regarding pricing of collateral to determine compensation was left off the plate for the sake of trying to simplify this massively into a single poll and to provide a more realistic alternative to compensate in something governance can obtain (MKR) vs. DAI (which would be terrible to markets trying to raise DAI by selling MKR) or ETH (worse selling MKR for DAI then buying ETH).  The idea of compensating in MKR was brought up by vault owners and honestly makes much more sense generally than taking MKR and converting it into DAI or collateral. The hardest part of working on this plan is that while we have some amount of input regarding the plan from forum people like yourself.   Given the lack of participation in the last poll I really don\u2019t think the compensation group has any real guidance on how to proceed to lay this to rest one way or the other.   We literally are making our best guess on what forum commentary we did get. Honestly depending on what the next poll brings (if we get a lack luster no again here) I will probably have run out of options and personally will find it much easier after all of the work we have done to leave this issue as dead via lack of governance participation. IF there is one thing I want to see from this vote it is participation. I\u2019d like to think I am speaking for the entire compensation group here but am speaking for myself.  In this current poll I want to see a definitive YES or NO with an executive level of MKR participating in this decision one way or another.   No matter how the vote turns I\u2019d love to actually see MORE MKR participatig in this one decision than in any other executive ever to lay this to rest, or to move it forward.   This isn\u2019t about whether Maker compensates vault owners.  This is about whether Maker holders feel settling this issue one way or another IS IMPORTANT not just to them but also to vault holders and the entire ecosystem once and for all. ",

You have to sell your solution to the MKR holders/voters. Do not forget, that this will be also in the news. And you do not want to embarrass the Maker protocol and community. So it needs to be understandable from the first look. As a first one - The DAI value does not matter. We users/bulls do not understand DAI/USD value. We understand ETH value. We know how many ETH we had and we do want to know how many ETH will be compensated. Here is an easy to understand example: The Poll should have 6 options: 1) Full compensation in MKR with a fixed exchange rate (statistical average since march 12 2020 up to the executive vote) for ETH and BAT. (Collateral in BAT or ETH) times (24.67%) minus (stability fee); 2) 80% compensation of 1); 3) 70% compensation of 1); 4) 60% compensation of 1); 5) 50% compensation of 1); 6) do not compensate with MKR (other solution needed). The math for maximum compensation might be boggy (i do not know - Working group numbers are different), but that is easily to fix. The fixed exchange rate of MKR to ETH and BAT can be defined as the statistical average from march 12 up to the executive vote. Ad up all average prices from every day since march 12 and divide by the total number of days.     monet-supply:   9% 621152DAI 2485MKR 6% 305187DAI 1221MKR 3% 101715DAI 407MKR 0% (Reject Vault Compensation)    These numbers should not be there. The 0% vote amounts to public sabotage. The go ahead for compensation was already decided.  https://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4 Going back on MKR voter word is very, very, very bad publicity. The least compensation should be 50/50. A fair split of the damages between users and MKR holders. MakerDAO has to be accountable for the technical risks. The users have to bare the market risks. 0 bid was technical. The market was also in a big dip.     MakerMan:  Lets use vault2288   Is this your vault? To be clear! There are no heroes.

From my liquidation report: Collateral Return Percent = (LR \u2013 (1+LF))/LR \u2022 LR = Liquidation Ratio = 150% = 1.5 \u2022 LF = Liquidation Fee = 13% = .13 \u2022 Collateral Return Percent for above =(1.5-(1+.13))/1.5 = 24.67% You then kind of \u2018go off\u2019 with the following statements:     Kukkio:  The DAI value does not matter .   and then propose your own version.     Kukkio:  The Poll should have 6 options:   This is the place to discuss suggestions you do not define your terms.     Kukkio:  statistical average since march 12 2020 up to the executive vote   stastical average of what exchange value?    average based on what criterion of what dataset of market prices?   The compensation group decided that it was easier and in fact gave similar results in terms of compensation with the simpler \u2018DAI tab change vs. vault collateral change\u2019 method as the primary formula that could be universally applied to all vaults along with the compensation percentage as a simple easy to measure and implement method of compensation. If you are going to come up with a different method that requires data that we don\u2019t have on hand at the moment, will you also provide this data and come up with real estimates of compensation based on the model you chose?  (i.e. produce an alternate plan to consider?) I am pretty much going to stop there except to add a pretty basic comment regarding the agressive approach in your replies here.   I can be pretty strong at times so I tend to be more forgiving of people who have strong emotions about what they are writing or speaking about.  Being passionate about things is ok.   So I simply make the observation and follow up with a suggestion.  tone down the \u2018bold\u2019 and try to avoid \u2018should not\u2019 and replace with \u2018might be better if\u2019, \u201cI suggest the following:\u201d or some variation of a reply that is suggestive of positive changes to the plan (or even an alternate plan) that seem less confrontational and more helpful. Just a suggestion. I am all for someone, anyone proposing another version of a compensation plan.  Define your terms, provide some data and another poll that has some MKR numbers.  You say 25.42% - stability fee.   Actually there is a Liquidation fee of 13% or are you really talking about the SF at the time?   You also say:     Kukkio:  The math for maximum compensation might be boggy   and     Kukkio:  Here is an easy to understand example:   Which I think based on the above previous comment means by your own admission your plan is a bit boggy mathwise. The devil is always in the details which our plan happens to provide (I/we did our best to provide).  If you don\u2019t like us listing the DAI estimate we used to calculate the Maker estimate - ignore it and focus on the MKR estimate. As to the 0% vote being     Kukkio:  public sabotage   Given we have two conflicting polls on whether to compensate that occured over 3 months. I think having a valid Reject option in the current plan, as well as one that says \u2018I want some other plan\u2019 is important especially given the conflicting results in the two polls we have run so far.  I think the compensation group also doesn\u2019t want to limit what governance can say here.   I would like to hear from others before making my own decision on whether to alter to poll or plan based on discussion here. This is why we present these things - to get public comment.  So thank you for your comments! ",

                    "content": "lix my friend.   Thank you for chiming in with an elaborate explanation of your reasoning.  I think a lot of people who would be yes to this are coming up in the 6-12% range for the same reasons. My only point and pitch here is remember we are taking the difference in collateral between before and after whatever happened to a vault against the voting % compensation choice and applying this to the DAI tab change at the time.   Choosing 6% as you have above will not make 0-bid vaults that got no collateral back whole to 6% of their collateral (ETH say) mostly because of 4x in ETH value over their DAI tab change.   In the end even after the conversion from DAI to MKR @ 250DAI/MKR we come up short on the 6% returned collateral (i.e. if the vault owner took the MKR and traded for collateral/ETH). The point with the method and these numbers was to find a consistent between all vaults \u2018fair\u2019 way of distributing however much MKR is associated with these voting choices between the vaults that is easily \u2018calculable\u2019 with on-chain data.    It was not to actually bring these vaults up to the chosen collateral return % being chosen because literally this is now much more expensive with ETH at 400USD vs. the auction at the time 100-150USD.   But using MKR valued at 250 vs current 560-580 does seem to help bring this closer than using any other metric (which will be significantly more complicated to calculate and require more polls) to some reasonably fair value that then is pretty well bracketed by the estimates given. I will have to look back at this but I think I have 130K ETH liquidated for all these vaults during BT (not including the self liquidators, and BAT group).  So if we think we would give back 6% ETH on that 130K liquidated we\u2019d end up at 7800 ETH and with MKR/ETH trading at 1.5 here this would mean 5200 MKR.   The 6% above will return about 1221 MKR or only 1/4 of the 6% of all ETH liquidated (so about 1.5% of the USD ETH value via MKR). If one really wanted to give back something like that 6% but spread it over vaults you would pick the 12% option as this would pay back 5196MKR spread over all vaults that got 12% or less of their collateral. Realize I am not trying to make you choose 12% I am just trying to explain the reality if you do choose 6% in terms of how much ETH a person would be getting back via the amount of MKR being distributed (1221 MKR or only about 1.5% give or take of their collateral auctioned depending on if they received any collateral back between the 0 and 6% range). Even at the theoretical maximum 24.67% at 11522MKR or 17283ETH (1.5 ratio chosen) this 130K ETH would only be getting back 13.2% collateral value as MKR at current collateral valuations using the model we have chosen.

The idea of compensating with MKR directly I think is more appealing because dilution is only going to be small (approx 1% up or down 1%).    We totally skip minting MKR - and selling it for DAI when the DAI price is high dropping the MKR/DAI price.   Seems better to just compensate with MKR and let everyone decide when and what to exchange for.   Who knows some may just keep the MKR and use it in governance. If the compensation is insanely low I doubt many vault holders will take it.   But as a compensation plan group member our job is simply to analyze the problem and present options to governance to choose to handle it and let governance decide. My vote for all it is worth. is probably going to go to around the 12% mark because the auctions when they came back up averaged about 12% collateral return and I know the model is going to come out low even if I select that so my bias will be probably 12, 15, 18 with probably a 9 as my last choice.  I may broad spectrum this from 6-21 depending on number of choices.   When I look at the numbers in the 12% range I think offering up 5000-6000 MKR (or .5-.6% dilution) worth 1.3-1.7M DAI to even close 1/2 of these vaults with respect to Black Thursday is worth it just to be done with everything.  1000-2000 (or .3-.6M DAI worth) just seems too low to me. Would I take 100-300DAI if I had lost like 20-50ETH.   Probably barely worth the effort to make the claim and wouldn\u2019t feel really great about it all.   But this is my own opinion and I thank you for sharing yours lix.   I hope even if others don\u2019t feel confident about sharing any of their view will come out and vote on the next poll.    We really need MKR governance to speak with a clear voice here.    Whether the compensation chosen is all over the map but still a YES, vs. a clear nothing and NO.   Either way I really want to see a decisive level of turn out as I consider laying this to rest one way or another really important for the protocol.   We need to get this off our governance plates so we can focus exclusively on improving the system so less liquidations happen or they happen more efficiently, as well as deal with longer term growth, PEG, collateral onboarding, creating payment mechanics for decentralized workers etc. I think it will be really cool and an important step if we can onboard some Real World Assets that could grow the system dramatically in reasonably secure risk controlled ways.   We definitely need to hit 1B DAI sooner than later, but we also need to consider adding at least a minimum stability fee so the protocol makes some DAI on the outstanding\u2026 ",

Compensating in mkr makes a lot of sense to me, and I\u2019m actually kind of surprised it was not brought up until fairly recently. It avoids auctions, it gives vault owners who feel they have been hurt by the protocol a say via in governance. It also doesn\u2019t necessarily drop the price of mkr because holders get to decide what they want to do with the tokens, and if they want to hold or sell. It\u2019s not a perfect stand in for eth, but the process for the protocol purchasing eth seems very inefficient. I get that mkr holders want to compensate in dai based on prices at liquidation. But I do feel this is probably inappropriate compensation. If compensation is to be done at all, imo it should be done in the asset that is most like ether. I think mkr is this most sensible asset to choose for this role. disclaimer: I am not an mkr holder, I was not liquidated during black Thursday, and I do not run keepers ",

This gave trust to the maker protocol. Several months later\u2026 most people forgot about the 0 bid problem and maker holders are happy to see that many new CDP\u2019s have helped to increase the outstanding DAI. So, I see some maker holders will vote for a 0% compensation, because they just want to forget about the zero bid problem and hope it will not get too much media attention. It just gives me a really ackward feeling and I would loose all trust in the way maker holders deal with their users. My other concern is about the compensation percentage. As discussed before, due to technical reasons, direct compensation in ETH is very difficult, but I don;t see why the max compensation is now limited to about 50% ?

Liquidated vaults that paid back debt or deposited additional collateral are also eligible. The estimate shall include sufficient documentation to facilitate replication.\u201d Eligible for consideration - that is fine, but it is not good to put everyone in one basket. \u201cConsideration\u201d does not mean that the compensation is decided. It would be awesome for the public image of MAKER, if the 0-bid victims (not the self liquidated) would be compensated extraordinary. Because that is comparably easy to do. The 0-bid cases are actually also the only ones the media cares about. The self liquidators are just those, who sold at the bottom - that is normal market dynamics. Actually i would say, that causality between damage and the technical problems of the MAKER protocol are obvious ONLY with the 0-bid victims. As long as the protocol did work fine -  there is no causality whatsoever. If the self liquidators - some call them as heroes and feel like paying them a bonus - feel misinformed by the user interface of the application they use to access the MAKER protocol, then they can put their claims to the provider of that user interface.

One idea to note from someone who has followed this process and those involved in it. I hope that as part of granting any compensation, the DAO will bind recipients to a public statement that they will not participate in the ongoing class action or some individual litigation and that they will not attempt to double-dip in recovery against the Foundation. I\u2019ve seen multiple handles here trying to drive claimants to the class action attorney and others who have made threatening (and I\u2019d say hyperbolic and ill-informed ) statements. Regardless, these people should understand that attempting to double recover will be a challenging (if not morally and ethically conflicted and potentially embarrassing) road to travel and if they take money from us, the DAO, then they are barred from going hat in hand to the Foundation.

                    "content": "I also wanted to give an update on progress and further details about the compensation calculations. We are planning on the poll going live this coming Monday September 7, and running for 2 weeks until September 21. The compensation calculations work as follows: MKR compensation amount = (collateral deficit percent * collateral value in DAI) / 250 collateral deficit percent = compensation percentage (determined by this poll) - percent of vault collateral already received from liquidation collateral value in DAI = debt tab at time of liquidation * liquidation ratio Integrating all 3 formulas: MKR compensation amount = [ (compensation percentage - percent of vault collateral already received from liquidation) * (debt tab at time of liquidation * liquidation ratio) ] / 250 Important note: In my initial post in this thread, I had made an oversight when calculating the maximum MKR amounts that would be required for each compensation percentage option. I had been multiplying the collateral deficit percent by the debt tab at time of liquidation, while I should have multiplied collateral deficit percent by collateral value in DAI. This means that the numbers posted in my initial post must be multiplied by the 150% liquidation ratio to correct this error. Given recent increase in demand for auditors and developers, the total operating expenses requested for handling compensation will be set to 50,000 DAI. Any unused funds will be returned to the Maker surplus after the compensation process has finished. Please refer to the revised numbers below, which show the maximum amount of MKR and DAI that will be authorized for each compensation percentage option presented in the forthcoming poll:  24.67% (theoretical maximum auction yield) - up to 25,925 MKR and 50,000 DAI 21% - up to 21,627 MKR and 50,000 DAI 18% - up to 18,216 MKR and 50,000 DAI 15% - up to 14,871 MKR and 50,000 DAI 12% - up to 11,691 MKR and 50,000 DAI 9% - up to 5,592 MKR and 50,000 DAI 6% - up to 2,748 MKR and 50,000 DAI 3% - up to 917 MKR and 50,000 DAI 0% (oppose vault compensation) - 0 MKR and 0 DAI Oppose current compensation plan (support vault compensation) 0 MKR and 0 DAI  As per the original post, it is considered highly unlikely that 100% of eligible vaults will claim compensation, so the final cost to Maker for any given poll option will likely be lower than the amounts shown. One more thing to note: if the poll resolves with a majority of votes in favor of \u201cOppose current compensation plan (support vault compensation)\u201d, or if this poll resolves with no option receiving at least 50% support, this will be considered a vote of no confidence in the current vault compensation working group. While working group members including myself will remain available for consultation, other members of the community will be empowered to take leadership over the vault compensation process. ",

                    "content": "Welcome to decentralization folks. No ONE single player has authority to act.   While one could say the Foundation could have. Quite honestly they couldn\u2019t.   So we are left with the DAO and people basically working for free who for the most part don\u2019t have a vested stake (vault2288 is the only one in the compensation group who has a vested interest I know of and he has been more than patient) trying to push this rock up a really high hill. I DO not see anyone stepping forward with a second plan or to even try to do anything except get people to sign on to a lawsuit which will probably take a number of years if not a decade to settle. A few of you have stepped up offering to help (thank you) and while I know we will need some help IF governance decides to move forward we will need more help.  The problem is the last poll was turned down by governance on a really thin vote as well as margin hence this has set this process back. Could this have been done faster?   A rhetorical question given the complexity and contentiousness within the community itself about even offering ANY form of compensation. Honestly I begin to think that at every on-ramp to crypto with money a big blazing warning needs to be posted and signed off on. Warning - you can lose all of your money - enter at your own risk - and by signing off you sign indicating your understanding that no-one owes you anything if you lose all of your money in the crypto box.   I had that warning given to me repeatedly.  It is so true my wife considers all of our crypto assets as ZERO until they buy something for us. So I am with @LongForWisdom here my empathy is dimishing for people who either can\u2019t or won\u2019t take responsibility for their own actions.   Plain and simple here is if you don\u2019t understand the risks and can\u2019t afford to lose the money trying to find out - don\u2019t play the game.   This space still is wild west days.  While centralized organizations are always going to do better then decentralized ones in some ways we all have to weigh the pros and cons of where we are putting our funds.  In the end we have to put our big boy pants to take on the responsibilities for our actions and enjoy our own profits as well swallow the losses like grown adults. A general rule about playing in high risk spaces, spread risk - far and wide.  Don\u2019t put all your eggs into any single basket for this one and many other reasons. Put as simply as possible Maker doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything no matter what happens.  Given what could happen no one should expect that if MKR price goes to 0 that anyone will be made whole.  DAI holders, vault holders, etc.  It is a real risk.  Is it probable - I think not.   But it is possible. Yes.  The FACT that Maker is still here after BT is a testiment to ability of the DAO and protocol to survive some difficult times, and that it will again.   But this idea that somehow someone was wronged here. I can\u2019t wait to see this Maker court case resolve actually one way or another just to see what the judges think when presented with both sides of the facts and weigh it against law. I have to say I don\u2019t see Maker as a crypto scam and that if you can\u2019t read a smart contract it is not the fault of anyone else except you the user.   I want one person to tell me they felt they reviewed fully the smart contracts on Maker, Compound. Yearn, Uniswap, before they used the things.   I haven\u2019t - have you?  So lets try to be honest not just with ourselves but each other here about the reality of where we are at.   This space is still experimental, still the wild west and yes indeedy you can still lose it all.  I think it will take at least 10-20 years before this space matures in a way to be able to service mom and pop joe-six pack in a way that most people are used to.   Which will mean the same stuff we deal with at banks (KYC/AML everywhere, limits and constraints as well as locks on capital based on certain constraints being exceeded. or other issues, etc.)  Everyone that wants frictionless money and premissionless access also will have to deal with \u2018uncompensated losses\u2019 and \u2018unexpected events that cause losses\u2019.   imo there is no real inbetween, but I am sure if there is some 3rd or 4th party will fill the gap somehow.   crypto losss insurance anyone? My apologies if the above seems crass but I am rapidly approaching my own personal fill of people who feel entitled because they lost something and won\u2019t take their own personal responsibility for their actions leading to that and find a way to move forward.   I have friends who to this day still wallow in how they were screwed by something, and how this hurt them that can\u2019t forgive the situation, pull up their pants shake it off and move forward in life positively.   Some of the worst shit that happened to me later I looked back on as the ONLY and best lessons that allowed me to grow and move forward. So I am sorry if what I write upsets you or gets under your gander but if you haven\u2019t learned the above lesson the sooner you do the better of you will be (imo).   Look around in this world and you quickly realize no-one owes you anything and to give some real heart felt thanks to anyone who cares about you enough to help you or to be your friend.  Hug your mom and tell her you love her, your dad, your friends, everyone because honestly it is really easy to end up alone, miserable, with no-one caring about you.   It is even harder in these times to maintain relationships. ",

This is your percent of vault collateral already received from liquidation as shown in the forumula above. (This number may be 0%) E.g. if a vault initially had 100 ETH before liquidation, and only received 5 ETH after liquidation, this number would be 5%. (2) Subtract the percent of vault collateral already received from liquidation from the compensation percentage, which will be determined by the upcoming governance vote. This is your collateral deficit percent. E.g. If governance votes for 15% compensation percentage, the same example vault from above would have a 10% collateral deficit percent (15% - 5%). (3) Multiply the total DAI debt owed by your vault (the debt tab at time of liquidation) by the minimum liquidation ratio for your vault type. This resulting value is your vault\u2019s collateral value in DAI. Note that for both BAT and ETH vaults, the liquidation ratio is 150%, so the collateral value in DAI = debt tab at time of liquidation * 1.5 for all vaults. E.g. If the example vault above had owed 10,000 DAI debt at the time of liquidation, their collateral value in DAI would be 15,000 DAI. (4) To calculate the hypothetical MKR compensation amount, multiply the collateral value in DAI by your vault\u2019s collateral deficit percent, and then divide by 250 DAI/MKR. E.g. the example vault above had a 10% collateral deficit percent and a 15,000 DAI collateral value, resulting in hypothetical compensation of 6 MKR. Bear in mind that the compensation amounts received will depend on the compensation percentage selected by governance in the upcoming poll, and any poll result will need to be passed in a subsequent MKR executive vote before compensation will be formally approved and become available for disbursement.

Vault Compensation Plan v3 Governance   poll   It is my hope to work up a final statement on the closure of this issue myself, but I believe it is in the interests of the compensation group to come up with a final statement on this issue. I will say that I am thankful governance spoke up with some participation and made the vote decisive.  I am personally sorry to all of you affected vault holders I personally was not able to speed up this process or sell the plan.  A pretty significant amount of my own life energy and time was put into this and my goal was simply to present a plan that would allow governance to speak clearly to the issue. I will be happy to consult and support any v3 initiative by others but will no longer act in any significant capacity on this issue as a front person trying to put anything together or sell it to anyone.  I won\u2019t be hurt if I am not consulted on v3. I want to thank everyone in the BT Compensation group ( @LongForWisdom, @monet-supply @jpritikin and @Vault2288 felix, as well as others who worked behind the scenes to support us ) for their hard long work,  a cooperative spirit, a hope that we could accomplish something positive for the entire community.  I believe we have succeeded in my primary goal.   Present the issue, and allow governance to speak.  My job was not to be vested in this passing, or failing, but only to provide the framework for governance to decide.

                    "content": "Hi All, Thanks very much for everyone\u2019s patience while we worked on getting this plan together. I have copied the plan document below and attached a google doc version. @MakerMan and I will be presenting on next week\u2019s Governance and Risk meeting to go over it, and I\u2019ll try to answer any questions people have in this post as well. For status updates, refer to this thread. Any vault specific info can be posted here. Without further ado: Compensation Plan Pursuant to the on-chain \u201cVault Compensation poll\u201d 62k yes to 33k no that passed 4/6/2020, we hereby submit a compensation plan for approval by MKR holders. MKR Holder Declaration This compensation plan constitutes a proposal for a compromise and settlement of claims from vault owners in respect of the circumstances underlying the vault compensation poll referenced above. No action taken by the persons drafting or implementing this compensation plan, either previously or in connection with this compensation plan shall be deemed or construed to be: (a) an admission of the truth or falsity of any claims heretofore made or (b) an acknowledgment or admission by any such persons of any fault or liability whatsoever to vault owners or to any third party. The present loss compensation plan is without prejudice to any rights or interests of the individuals drafting or executing this compensation plan and any position that any such person may take in legal or administrative proceedings and addresses certain specific circumstances where MKR holders may volunteer to provide certain compensation to vault holders. The persons drafting or implementing this compensation plan maintain that MKR holders have no obligation to issue any compensation for losses, and volunteer to implement this plan solely at their discretion. Goals and principles  Completeness - Ideally this process should address all outstanding claims for compensation. Fairness - Similarly situated users should receive similar levels of compensation. Consensus - Giving MKR voters the ability to choose key parameters will help ensure that the final executive vote has the support necessary to pass.  Overview of compensation process Vaults that were liquidated at auction or self-liquidated their positions between 3/12/2020 12:00 UTC and 3/13/2020 13:40 UTC will be considered for compensation; liquidations falling outside of this time period do not qualify. Compensation amounts for ETH vaults that were liquidated at auction shall be determined based upon the compensation method and price selected by governance in poll (2). Once the compensation amount is determined, a smart contract will be created to administer the funds transfers. Vault owners not included in the initial compensation class (BAT vaults liquidated at auction and ETH or BAT vaults that self-liquidated) will have the opportunity to provide documentation to substantiate their claim, and receive compensation at the rate from governance poll (2). Vault holders shall be required to issue a transaction to withdraw compensation to their account, and compensation will only be made available to the address associated with the vault. Proposed Stages Each period lists deliverables (what needs to happen before moving to the next step), polling or voting cadence, and reasoning for why these steps are necessary or why this proposed order may work well. Phase 0: Governance poll:  Approval for vault compensation plan a. Approve b. Decline  Reasoning: Poll (1) ensures that there is general alignment behind the proposed plan of action before beginning further MKR polling. If MKR holders vote to decline the initial plan, additional feedback can be gathered to determine what parts of the plan are controversial and then create an alternate plan that addresses these issues. This will likely require MKR polls for some of the items/questions listed in the Icebox section below, and may require additional vault analysis depending on outcomes. Deliverables:  Working group agrees on plan document Plan document posted to forum for discussion and presented on governance call Need to confirm exact verbiage for on chain poll (1) and for the following week\u2019s poll (2) Gain MKR governance approval for plan via governance poll (1)  Phase 1: Governance poll:  What compensation method and price should we choose for paying claims? (forum thread) (github pull request) a. Collateral using nominal collateral return percentage and price on 3/13 b. Collateral using nominal collateral return percentage and price on day before compensation is awarded (approximating paying claims in ETH/BAT) c. Collateral using nominal collateral return percentage and average price of a+b d. Tab change in relation to collateral change (using same collateral return percentage and collateral deficit percentage but applied to the DAI TAB.)  Reasoning: Compensation is a necessary prerequisite to determining the total DAI values for compensation tiers, so determining this at the beginning should help enable comprehension of future polls. Deliverables:  Obtain MKR vote for (2) Obtain quotes for work necessary for compensation disbursement:  Smart contract development and audit Vault compensation analysis audit Payment for working group time up to this point Estimated cost for vault claims review and future working group time   Need exact verbiage of on chain polls for week 2 (3, 4, and 5) as well as executive vote  Calculate ETH-A liquidation compensation amounts, as well as total claim contract funding amount (150% of ETH-A liquidations) for each percentage option in poll (3) to ensure voter comprehension    Phase 2 Governance polls: (3) Vault compensation percentage poll (4) Poll for including a funding request for building and auditing smart contract and payment for working group expenses into next executive (forum thread) (github repository) Executive vote: (5) Approve funding for smart contract work, audits for compensation contract, plan writing, project management, any other work involved in setting up claim Reasoning: Poll (3) allows MKR holders to decide what they view as a fair level of compensation. The polls for reference price/compensation method will already have been completed, so this should allow MKR holders to have a close estimate of the final DAI amount to be repaid for each percentage option. Poll (4) and the executive vote are necessary for the protocol to fund development and auditing work to put the approved compensation plan into action. Deliverables:  Obtain poll results for (3) and (4) as well as executive vote (5) for funding Confirm verbiage for final governance poll and executive vote Ensure that the compensation contract and audits are on track Manage invoicing and payment of devs/auditors Develop procedure for reviewing claims from BAT and self-liquidated vaults  Phase 3: Governance poll: (6) Poll to include funding the compensation contract into next executive (Yes/No) Executive vote: (7) Approve funding compensation contract (similar to the Protocol DAI Transfer but without the frozen period) Reasoning: The governance poll (6) and executive vote are necessary to gain final approval from MKR holders for the compensation package specified in polls (1) through (3). The poll provides an opportunity for MKR holders to formally decide whether the compensation contract is ready to deploy. To provide compensation to vaults outside of the initial compensation class, 150% of the decided DAI amount will be allocated with the extra amount set aside for claimants that step forward and provide adequate documentation. Deliverables:  Gain approval for governance poll (6) and final executive vote (7) Ensure broad communication of compensation package and claims procedures to affected vaults and wider Maker community, including any terms of accepting offer, deadlines, or other restrictions  Create and distribute a press release explaining the claims process for vault owners: vaults with collateral available to claim in Oasis, Black Thursday ETH auctions, Black Thursday BAT auctions and self-liquidated vaults Coordinate comms with Maker community messaging team Work with Maker UI providers to communicate claims process (Oasis, DefiSaver, etc)    During the compensation period: Claimants outside the initial compensation class can submit data to FORUM THREAD to substantiate their claim. For example, these claimants include  Vaults that self-liquidated BAT vaults  The compensation review team (i.e., Maker_man, felix, jpritikin, monetsupply, befitsandpiper, and any additional members) will review these data. If the claim checks out then the compensation team will add the claimant to the compensation smart contract to permit funds disbursement. The compensation team reserves the right to unilaterally decide whether a claim is valid or invalid. Claims posted more than 30 days from the beginning of the compensation period will not be considered. No appeals shall be entertained. All decisions are final and at the discretion of the compensation team. Phase 4: Executive vote: (8) Return unclaimed funds from the compensation contract back to the surplus account. Reasoning: Compensation should be claimed within approximately 90 days. We cannot extend the time window indefinitely because lawsuits may be in the works and vault holders need to decide promptly whether they will receive compensation and waive the right to sue, or join a suit.

Appendix: Icebox Potential options for Maker governance not included in proposed governance plan. In the event that the initial MKR poll to approve the compensation plan is rejected, the Maker community can signal which parts of the plan were contentious and potentially revisit some of the questions below.  Poll to confirm payment of compensation in DAI or ETH/BAT   A poll was developed to decide this question. However, during the drafting of this poll, it became clear that it is much simpler to compensate in DAI. Proposing to move forward with compensation in DAI because Maker does not currently have the ability to acquire collateral assets. Maker voters can instead use a different reference price for ETH/DAI and BAT/DAI to approximate compensation with ETH or BAT Deciding to compensate with ETH/BAT will likely add substantial delays to the compensation process.   Poll to determine/confirm the time bounds (start and end time) for vault auctions or self liquidations that will be covered by compensation plan  Proposing to move forward with vault inclusion criteria and start/end times from original Liquidation Report as discussed in the forums Based on initial analysis, it looks like the Black Thursday period (3/12/2020 12:00 to 3/13/2020 13:40, ETH auctions 763-4324) covers the vast majority of users who lost funds, and covers substantially all of the zero bid auctions as well as the worst of the Black Thursday price falls and gas spikes Possible counterargument: first and last 0% collateral return auctions near Black Thursday occurred at 3/12/20 8:00 UTC and 3/14/20 0:00 UTC, and last 0% collateral return auctions before auction freeze module and USDC were added occured by 3/16/20 13:00 UTC  Alternative time bounds would require additional analytical work, delaying issuance of compensation Additional auction selection criterion:  < N% tab recovered, Auction fetched < % some market price (only have OSM, uniswap markets, anything else need data which will delay compensation) Collateral returned was < some chosen nominal %     Some process to select or approve the compensation review team  To speed up the process, we propose that the team will be formed by the same people who drafted the plan. Some process can be added to the plan if the community feels like this is needed.   Appeal process for compensation review team decisions  To keep things simple, compensation review decisions shall be final and non-negotiable. If the community feels like there is need for an appeal process, this can be added but will increase complexity, time, and cost required to administer the plan.   Poll to approve compensating vaults that self-liquidated  Proposing to move forward with \u201cyes\u201d, based on principles of fairness and completeness above Users who took action to avoid liquidation likely saved MKR holders from additional bad debt, so it would seem unfair if these users ended up worse of than similar vault owners who allowed their positions to be liquidated   Poll to confirm using the same time bounds, reference price parameters, and compensation framework for self-liquidating vaults as for vaults that were liquidated by the system  Proposing to move forward with \u201cyes\u201d based on principle of equality If poll resolves to \u201cno\u201d, follow up work/polling may be required to set reference price and time bounds for these vaults or identify alternative compensation heuristics   Poll to confirm mechanics of compensation for vaults that were liquidated at auction  Option 1: Uniform minimum collateral return percentage for vaults within time bounds (1) - topping up any vaults that received less than agreed standard (current compensation analysis covers this) Option 2: Uniform premium/discount percentage versus VWAP of ETH/DAI or BAT/DAI  Need to determine the time used for valuing vault collateral (auctions don\u2019t settle instantly) Need to perform additional vault compensation analysis to determine overall and vault-by-vault compensation levels If we do any compensation that has a time element to determine some value then someone will need to choose what this means for compensation. Example liquidations happen in phases (tend, dent, deal) and these phases usually happen in different blocks. Someone will have to define what time we use to define a market price for this case so a time based value choice can be applied to existing data.   Option 3: Tab based compensation. Apply the nominal collateral return to determine a collateral return deficit to multiply the tab in DAI to determine DAI compensation. This option is by far easiest to calculate over all possible claimants but it fails to compensate directly for collateral value (option 1) Options 1 and 3 from this section have been incorporated into poll (2) to determine compensation method and price   Whether to suck the maximum possible compensation in a single executive or to spread it out over multiple executives  Spreading out the fund raising over multiple executives puts less pressure on the price of MKR from FLOP auctions. However, this approach has the danger that later tranches of funding may not be approved. Compensation funds could be exhausted and some otherwise eligible vault owners might not be compensated. Therefore, we will suck enough DAI in a single executive to pay all potential claims. Surplus DAI will be returned to the protocol after a suitable waiting period.   Whether to wait until the surplus account can fully fund this compensation plan to avoid FLOP auctions.

A: This would be unwise. These polls are mutually dependent. Intermediate vote results on one poll would change the probabilities on the other poll. Q: Could the compensation amount polls be run in the opposite order? A: Yes, but the proposed order seems easier for MKR holders to decide. It may be hard to decide the auction refund percentage without knowing the reference price. Q: Why wasn\u2019t the asset reference price poll initiated on May 11? A: Rich pointed out that signaling guidelines were not followed. Rich requested that more attention be put toward building consensus. For example, we should map out a complete plan before we run more polls. Q: Why do we need a smart contract to convey compensation? A: How else can it be done? Compensation will involve 100s of token transfers. It is not possible to batch all of these transfers into a single executive spell. A natural person could be nominated to issue the transactions, but what assurance do we have that the tokens will be transferred correctly? The total amount could be large. Who do we trust to handle that kind of cash? Q: Is requiring users accept a release to claim compensation useful or legally valid? A: We will draft the language as if it has legal force, but whether or not it has legal force is not important. The agreement is important because it educates that vault holders can either claim compensation or join as plaintiff in a legal action, but not both. Q: Will vault holders be able to interact directly with the smart contract as well or will interactions need to take place through the GUI? A: It is always possible to interact directly with a smart contract, but we will encourage invoking claim() from our static webpage that informs the claimant that claiming compensation causes them to waive the right to sue. Q: What benefits do we obtain from using a smart contract and asking vault holders to claim compensation? A: By requiring the vault holder to claim compensation, we ensure that they currently have an active wallet (that is, private key is not lost). In addition, we can stipulate that the act of claiming compensation waives the possibility of future litigation. Q: How do we handle the final executive vote to fund compensation contract if MKR voters decide to use a reference price based on when the compensation is issued? Depending on how long vote takes to pass, there is the potential for the market price drifting away from the intended reference price. A: The last opportunity to set the reference price is when the contract is created and address recorded for approval in the executive spell. That\u2019s why particular language is used in the reference price poll. Q: Where will the GUI to claim compensation be hosted? A: On github as a static web page. If we can get a domainname like march13claim.makerdao.com to point to our static web page, that will be great, but it\u2019s not required. Q: What is the Tab compensation plan (option 2d)? A: While going through claimants both within the BT plan proper and those who might be outside of the plan (self liquidators like vault 2288) we found that for most cases looking at the collateral change vs. the borrowed debt (TAB) change that it was easiest to value the damage in terms of the debt change as the Liquidation Ratio set by the borrower effectively determined the collateral value. In the loosest sense it makes more sense to value the compensation based on the amount borrowed since liquidation would occur based on the changing value of the collateral. The only change here is that we use the collateral return deficit to multiply the TAB change to determine compensation in DAI. Q: Define the collateral return deficit? A: If governance decides that compensation should be determined based on how much collateral was returned then one can uniformly apply this \u2018nominal collateral return\u2019 to the \u2018actual collateral returned\u2019 to create: Collateral return deficit = nominal collateral return (chosen by governance) - collateral returned Typically we look at this as a percentage because the theoretical return percentage is defined by the LR for the collateral type. Q: Can you give examples of application of options in poll #2 (a-d) to some vaults. A: Yes. Using a nominal collateral return of 18% as a working example and value for poll option 2a at 100DAI/ETH, 2b at 240DAI/ETH, 2c = 170DAI/ETH Example 1: Self liquidator Vault 2288 Before 5005ETH After 585.18ETH Collret 11.69% Tab 423835.88 Colldef 18 - 11.69% = 6.31% (.18 - .1169) * 5005 = 315.8155 ETH 2a(DAI) 315.8155 * 100 DAI / ETH = 31581.55DAI 2b(DAI) 315.8155 * 240 DAI / ETH = 75795.72DAI 2c(DAI) 315.8155 * 170 DAI / ETH = 53688.64DAI 2d(DAI) (.18 - 1169) * 423835.88 DAI = 26744.04DAI Example 2:   0-bid liquidated Vault 3834 Before 100.1 ETH After    0 ETH\t\t\t\t Collret 0% Tab\t9049.466 Colldef\t18% .18 * 100.1 = 18.018 ETH 2a(DAI) 18.018 * 100 DAI / ETH = 1801.8DAI 2b(DAI) 18.018 * 240 DAI / ETH = 4324.32DAI 2c(DAI) 18.018 * 170 DAI / ETH = 3063.06DAI 2d(DAI) .18 * 9049.466 DAI = 1628.90DAI Appendix: Working Group Payment Rate of pay: TBD, possibly 50 DAI per hour Hours worked as of 6/15/2020:  Joshua Pritikin \u2013 40 Monet Supply \u2013 24 Maker Man \u2013 30 Felix \u2013 4 Befitsandpiper \u2013  Total outstanding working group time as of 6/15/2020: 98 hours Total outstanding working group payment as of 6/15/2020: 4900 DAI Future tasks requiring compensation:  Additional writing, analysis, and project management (working group)  Cost estimate: TBD   Create compensation smart contract (outside developer)  Cost estimate: TBD   Audit compensation smart contract (outside auditor)  Cost estimate: TBD   Review and process claims from BAT auctions and self-liquidated vaults (working group)  Cost estimate: TBD    ",

Good morning everyone. The above is pretty much the summary statement regarding moving forward. MKR holders have no obligation to issue any compensation to any one for any thing. Everyone knows I tend to look at the bigger picture here.   This Compensaion Plan(CP) above is pretty much the best measure of how to move forward on the subject from my perspective in the compensation group as well as the data guy atm.  See Phases 0, 1, 2. From a Maker and a Vault Holder perspective it is a take it or leave it proposal.   Governance could balk on the above CP and simply say no leave it to courts whatever.  If governance says yes to the CP they are also saying they \u2018still\u2019 are not obligated to actually \u2018do\u2019 anything, The same is true from vault holder perspective: IF governance DOES anything, they still gets to say yes, or no, to whatever offer governance lays on the table for each of them here by simply not acting, they opt out. We did the best job and presented two different methods in Phase 2 to spead compensation across a class of vaults to catch the most affected based on a number of governance controlled criterion.  We chose to pick up any straggling vaults making claims as we go along in this process as governance progresses and discussion and polling ensues in Phase 3. The details ultimately - to be discussed/polled on Phases 0-4. One thing I want people to pay attention to.   We don\u2019t expect the vault class to 100% accept this deal. We want  it to be clear by being forced to \u2018opt in\u2019, not doing anything means opting out!   While I would hope a deal would be accepted 100%. I personally don\u2019t expect this.   If even 50% of the class to opt in I think the CP would be a success to some extent. Hence whatever pricetag is placed on this CP by governance realize perhaps > 50% of it won\u2019t be claimed. Beyond this there is some challenge to hammer out the details.  Particularly when we come to poll 2 - compensation method but once we hurdle that the rest should be pretty easy. I want vault holders to know that anyone that falls outside of the class proper however this is decided you guys aren\u2019t forgotten.  It is a general hope (see icebox) that governance takes into account how to settle up any secondary claims via discussion but imho think the group doen\u2019t feel like we can unilaterally address this, governance has to speak to certain issues, and we as the group then are guided by governance.   Our job is to frame this so the community and governance can speak. Our group goal as the CP creator was simply to try to put some kind of plan together that can be acted on by governance however we may personally side here. The CP is our best shot where MKR holders can realistically offer a good gesture hand to vault holders who feel like they got hammered on BT to settle the issue and move forward. Honestly if someone, any one has a better idea or a great reason to stop this feel free to speak up because so far a lot of work has been put into this, it is time to $DAI or get off the pot.  The CP above as presented is our best shot here. As always submitted for public comment and debate. ",

This wasn\u2019t intended to be a dig against vault holders, or to prejudice the governance process towards providing less compensation. The main purpose of stating this is to try to avoid legal problems with the current situation and set expectations that compensation will not be provided for any events that might occur in the future. Vault owners have rights and responsibilities which are written into Maker\u2019s source code and described in the docs (e.g. vault owners can withdraw collateral over their required liquidation ratio at any time, but they are also responsible for maintaining sufficient collateral). However, if vaults are liquidated, there is no guarantee made of receiving any collateral back as this depends on the auction price. The liquidation process may not have been understood by some users, but MakerDAO and MKR holders only control the core protocol and not any user interfaces. Without control, they can\u2019t take on responsibility for disclosures on websites that offer vault creation. ",

What there is for sure is a commitment as the on-chain \u201cVault Compensation poll\u201d 62k yes to 33k no that passed 4/6/2020 clearly states. (that such a governance mandate is an obbligation or not, is something that would\u2019t worth to tackle IMHO) BTW, I understand the reasoning of the following:     monet-supply:  Phase 0: Governance poll:  Approval for vault compensation plan a. Approve b. Decline    my understanding is that the outcome wouldn\u2019t be binding at all (as per the just mentioned governance mandate), I see this as a way to signal intentions/perception from MKR holders about their sympathy with the proposal and find things to be improved. correct?

The second Phase 0: Poll #1 is basically to determine if governance is ok with the plan as it stands or not. I am hoping we have a forum poll but I am going to leave that up to governance facilitators to decide.   I think everyone is just waiting for some discussion phase.    Everyone has an opinion regarding whether there is an obligation for compensation.   Even vault 2288 who is on the team pretty much agreed there was no obligation but we all on the team felt since governance signalled the intention to compensate we should be clear about what this process means.   Our concern is that we start this, everyone thinks they will get something and then it fails or gets stuck for some reason and governance simply refuses to go further (i.e. funding compensation for example). I think part of the plan was coming together on a general statement regarding the issue and then simply put together the pieces of a plan governance will have to approve/execute in steps so there is a start to end process and reasonably well defined governance and other steps to execute the plan.   Governance in the end gets to choose the qualification criterion, compensation method, then the amount.  Then vault holders elidgible get to make their choice whether to reject or accept the offer.

This passed with a 9.54% participation rate (95,924.47 MKR total votes) and 76 unique voters.   After that poll, individuals on this forum decided that a more formalized compensation plan was necessary and set about creating one.   After much hard work and several months later, another poll was executed this week asking MKR token holders if we want to go ahead with the detailed plan (which specified further polls). This failed with a 4.35% participation rate (43,700.92 MKR total votes) and 33 unique voters.   Assuming at least a certain overlap of voters from the two polls, we need to know what the community wants. Otherwise, we\u2019re back where we started 3 months ago. But I want to point out very clearly that, as things stand now, there is still more evidence of support for compensating rather than not compensating. However, for some reason, we haven\u2019t been able to pass a poll to determine how this should actually go down. I am also sympathetic to @Spidomo\u2019s suggestion of a \u201cone and done\u201d poll, but this might end up rubbing people the wrong way\u2026 even more so than they already are now. ",

I guess we are here now  where it\u2019s valid to assume MKR governance still have the intention to compensate vault losses but doesn\u2019t accept the plan presented so far. Therefore, we just need to improve this, but I wondered how can we gather feedback from the \u201cNO\u201d voters. I know by experience the cognitive cost implicit in voting, and I just can imagine the main reason people voted \u201cno\u201d is because the plan is actually very complex to understand. It took me a while to understand it, because I have special interest as a Black Friday Victim, I can only guess that people with nothing to lose would tend to vote \u201cno\u201d (or not voting) if they have to dedicate some effort to understand the plan. ATM, I have more questions than answers (as I guess most of the people here):  Why do we simplify the plan\u2019s communication so we minimize cognitive cost to MKR voters? How do we gather valuable feedback about why people voted no? What are we missing here? Do we have in mind ant improvements/suggestions to make that would empathize with MKR \u201cno\u201d voters that might encourage them to vote \u201cYES\u201d in a follow up poll? Would it be worth to create more awareness outside Maker community before next voting will happen looking forward to increase MKR voting participation while making also some social pressure around the topic?  I can only agree with this      Spidomo:  Maybe Maker Token Holders would be more receptive to a compensation plan which specifies exactly which vaults get compensation, and exactly how much.
