(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): Problem: A number of DAOs have started utilizing delegation to improve governance and solve the problem of voter apathy. There are a number of teams including us at Karma who have built interfaces to make it easy for token holders to find a suitable delegate based on various criteria and delegate their tokens. However, after working on this for over a year, we have seen a number of challenges with how the delegation systems work today.1. When a delegate wants to move on, there is no way for them to withdraw their nomination. None of the contracts support withdrawal functionality.2. There is no good place to look up a delegate\u2019s interests and skills, it\u2019s either non-existent or locked in centralized databases.3. Today, delegates post their commitment message on the forum and everyone has to scrape that info and display it in their systems. There is no global shared place where this data is stored.4. Delegates can receive attestations from other delegates and DAO core teams but these are not stored in a centralized place for all the UIs to interpret and display.5. There is no way for delegates to broadcast a message and for all the frontend interfaces to listen to their message.Solution:We would like to build a DAO delegate registry on Optimism network to store the followingabout each Delegate mapped to the DAO they belong to1. Delegate address2. Delegate interests3. Delegate statement (not on IPFS but store the entire blob of text on-chain possibly)4. Delegate status (active, withdrawn, recognized etc.)All of this information would be written to the chain by delegates themselves. We are exploring two ways to accomplish this.Gasless execution: The user simply signs a message and we store it on-chain on behalf of them. This will be low friction and the user doesn\u2019t need to have OP tokens to interact.Standard execution: This user has to execute transactions themselves and will need OP tokens.By building a global registry, various teams in the ecosystem can utilize this data on a decentralized store and display it in their interfaces. By putting the registry on blockchain, it will always be accessible, will become a single source of truth, make delegations efficient and will open up more innovation. The registry can be used for discovering delegates, integrate with different types of on-chain voting systems and so on.

Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): We have around 100,000 governance participants in our dashboard spanning 55 DAOs. It\u2019s all sitting in our database. One of the goals of this project is starting moving all this data on to the Optimism network. Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://deepdao.io/, https://boardroom.io/, Nouns Agora Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 3/15/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: DAO delegate information is spread across different centralized databases and there is no global, decentralized registry everyone can rely on. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: By building a global registry, various teams in the ecosystem can utilize this data on a decentralized store and display it in their interfaces. By putting the registry on blockchain, it will always be accessible, will become a single source of truth, make delegations efficient and will open up more innovation. The registry can be used for discovering delegates, integrate with different types of on-chain voting systems and so on. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: DAOs who opt-in to this solution will have all their delegates interacting with the Optimism network to register and manage their information. As we onboard more DAOs, the number of delegates interacting with the Optimism network grows. We have plans to extend this functionality to many more usecases and this will result in sustained growth of the Optimism network. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: Yes, here is the link to the proposal [READY][GF: Phase 1 Proposal] Karma discourse forum plugin. We successfully built the dashboard and have been maintaining it and have even added additional features to the dashboard. We even started an accountability thread on the forum here Karma - Grantee accountability+feedback thread to hold ourselves accountable. Number of OP tokens requested: 50,000 Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): OP tokens will primarily be used for 2 purposes1. Cover the gas cost - 50% of tokens will be used for gasless execution (if we do decide on gasless route) or compensate delegates for executing transactions.2. Team - 50% of the tokens will be used to compensate our team. We will not sell the tokens for a year per the agreement.We have already listed all the benefits of having a global shared registry. The biggest friction is in getting users to acquire tokens and use it for transactions. Rewarding users with OP tokens for using the system is not scalable and is short term and unsustainable solution. Instead, we will strive to have gasless execution or retroactively compensate for the transactions the delegates perform on-chain.This is a major undertaking and we would like the remaining 50% of the tokens to be used to compensate our team. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: We plan to use the tokens over a period of 2 months which will give us enough time to determine how the initiative is working. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: Milestone 1: 2 months to build and launch the product Milestone 2: 2 months of running the registry and getting delegates to sign up. We will continue to enhance the product over this 2 months based on our learnings. Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?: We don\u2019t plan to incentivize users directly. Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability (smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.): Organization wallet address: 0x627f84bb4bBA3333f253F09fe22A445F195bCF34 Confirm you have read and agree to the Eligibility Restrictions (here): I have read the Eligibility Restrictions and agree to abide by their conditions ",

Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 2 months from the date of approval (Tentative May 1st, 2023) Milestone 1: Finalize requirements gathering and technical solution Week 1 - We have already done a lot of research and are gathering requirements by talking to DAOs and delegates. We aim to finalize the requirements soon. Week 2 - Work has begun on the technical architecture. We want to fully architect the solution and get advice from other smart contract engineers and also the OP team to make sure the design is sound. The eventual product goal is to expand beyond what we have in the proposal and we want to make sure we build it right. Milestone 2: Smart contract implementation (Benchmark Milestone) Week 3 & 4 - We will start the implementation of smart contracts. It will be an iterative process and the goal is to have the MVP of the contract to be able to store basic delegate information, their statement, interests and ability for delegates to claim their profile and update their info. Milestone 3: Design and implement frontend (Critical Milestone) Week 4, 5 & 6 - Create high fidelity mockups of the design, get feedback from end users. Implement the MVP frontend based on the designs to interact with the contracts. Integrate all the components to make sure the entire application works end to end. Milestone 4: Deploy and test (Critical Milestone) Week 6 & 7 - Deploy MVP to the network, test and gather feedback and add more missing features. Index data by building subgraphs utilizing the Graph Protocol for anyone to easily query on-chain data. Milestone 5: Launch to one DAO (Critical Milestone) Week 8 & 9 - Launch publicly to one DAO and let delegates claim their profiles. Fix bugs and add any features required to onboard delegates. Milestone 6: Rollout to more DAOs (Benchmark Milestone) Week 10 - 12 - Start rolling out to more DAOs and delegates. By now, we would have gathered more feedback and we can start whitelisting more DAOs and delegates. We will continue to iterate and add more features and get more adoption. We will also add developer docs for other interested parties to start integrating with the registry. The goal is to get at least 10 delegates/week to claim their profile and update their information from here on. We will continue to iterate, build and improve the product. Below are some tentative milestones and features we plan to build over the next weeks. Milestone 7: Bring Voting reason to chain (Benchmark Milestone) Week 13 - 16 - Every delegate posts their voting reason on forum, twitter and other channels regularly. Since the goal of our product is to build a registry with all the information on-chain, it makes logical sense to provide an interface for delegates to write the voting reason to chain and have it accessible to anyone. Milestone 8: Peer to peer endorsement (Benchmark Milestone) Week 17 - 22 - Token holders have a hard time picking a delegate to assign their voting power to. Having delegates with high voting power endorse other upcoming delegates will help spread the voting power, give more opportunity to new delegates and decentralize the DAO further. Milestone 9: Registration fee Week 23 - 26 - If a DAO wants to introduce a registration fee for officially registering as a delegate, we would like to implement that feature to enable this. This feature could also help prevent non serious candidates from enrolling as a delegate. Milestone 10: Write delegate\u2019s aggregated stats to chain Week 27 - 30 - Karma aggregates\u2019s delegate\u2019s voting and other stats to help the community understand delegate activity. If this is valuable to other platforms, we can write this data to the registry as well. ",
