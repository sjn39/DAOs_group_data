                    "content": "Project Name: BarnBridge Author Name: Tyler Ward Number of OP tokens requested: 600,000 $OP Timeline for distribution: 8 months L2 Recipient Address: Relevant Usage Metrics: (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc.)  ~10k BOND holders 1,000 DAO members $15M in TVL across the BarnBridge protocol  Optimism alignment (up to 200 word explanation):  BarnBridge is moving its DAO to Optimism & will deploy its new Smart Yield v2 product on both Optimism & Ethereum mainnet. We\u2019re also planning to migrate our BOND token to Optimism. We believe Optimism will drastically reduce friction associated with using Smart Yield v2 & enable a far wider range of our users to participate in governance (i.e., vote on proposals at far cheaper gas prices). Further, we\u2019ve had our Smart Alpha product deployed on Optimism since Oct 202. Smart Alpha has had about $30m in exit transactions across all networks & Optimism was among the first L2 networks we launched it on. Finally, we maintain a close relationship with the Synthetix ecosystem & have had early discussions around closer collaboration and opportunities for integrations on Optimism.  Proposal for token distribution (under 1000 words):  We hope to leverage an allocation from the $OP Governance Fund to 1) incentivize Smart Yield v2 users, 2) bring sustainable liquidity to our platform on Optimism, 3) reward dedicated builders working to enhance the Barnbridge platform & 4) incentivize BOND holders to vote to migrate our DAO & governance fully to Optimism.  How will the OP tokens be distributed? Total Ask: 600,000 OP Tokens SMART Yield Users: 33.33% Optimism LP: 25% Builders: 25% Move BOND\u2019s governance: 16.67% How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Even before the collapse of Luna we have spent almost 7 months completely rebuilding how fixed income and incentives for fixed income work in crypto. It was obvious that just printing more tokens for higher APYs/APRs was not going to end well so we wanted to reassess. This is also why our TVL dropped from its height of $600m to $16m (currently). We wanted to rebuild the entire system without focusing on ponzinomics.  1600\u00d7451 366 KB  It\u2019s obvious when we decided to pivot and focus on a new rewards mechanism that was more long term focused. However, utilizing tokens (or let\u2019s call this unsustainable reward mechanisms) to attract original entrants is an age-old use case in both finance and the broader markets. So we still will be utilizing token rewards in our system, they will just result in more market driven fixed income rates. It would be amazing if we could use the OP token as well to jumpstart liquidity to a place where we won\u2019t need ongoing liquidity longer term (which is the hope of variable income protocols and capital markets like AAVE and Compound). Upon launch, we believe BarnBridge on Optimism will be the MOST sustainable and MOST long term focused fixed income mechanism. This should make sense given that we were the first mainstream or major launch of fixed income in defi and we have been extremely focused on that vertical since launching SMART Alpha on Optimism last September. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up?  Incentivizing more capital allows the pool to earn more yield which gets distributed in the next epoch, therefore increasing demand for that epoch. This creates a positive liquidity loop where more capital = more earnings = more capital = \u2026  Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed?  We would look to incentivize our pools for 6 months with the OP tokens allocations.  How much will your project match in co-incentives?  SMART Yield: This is difficult to estimate because we are bonding our token to liquidity providers on the LP positions of SMART Yield. In other words, our DAO will be accepting risk as the sole liquidity provider. Due to this, we will have a unique way of providing liquidity to this system. However, we expect our liquidity to far exceed the dollar value of this grant. LP (BOND/USDC [or LUSD]): We want the most liquid stablecoin on Optimism or WETH to pair with our longer term liquidity incentives. I think it\u2019s our responsibility, within reason, to match or exceed the incentives. However, we will begin porting liquidity to Optimism when our main net pool (that we cannot turn off) ends. At that time, we have no idea what the value of the token allocated for this will be and it could potentially exceed our treasury. For that reason I think we need to use discretion but recognize that we should not solely rely on Optimism tokens. So there are scenarios that our incentives will be higher and vice versa but I think the people reading this will be very happy if ours are less at that time due to a run up in the OP token price.  Edit: after reading this feedback we have changed the ask from 3m tokens to 600k tokens and changed the distribution to this: Total Ask: 600,000 OP Tokens SMART Yield Users: 33.33% Optimism LP: 25% Builders: 25% Move BOND\u2019s governance: 16.67% ",

Given the significant impact of moving the entire governance of Barnbridge to Optimism and cost to the retail user it would be both a sign of good will to support such an undertaking as well as giving support to  a project that has already invested in Optimism as an early adopter in the DeFi space. Barnbridge has been battle tested and continues to thrive during market headwinds and deserves the support of the Optimistic ecosystem. Thank you. ",

I\u2019m not sure how to use the quotes like you did so I\u2019ll go one by one.   We stopped all incentives for BarnBridge while we worked towards a more sustainable product. At our peak we actually had over $600m in TVL if that helps.   Wait, are you talking about posting the DAO on chain? It is all currently in audit.   No it is not live yet, it is in audit and will launch in the next 30 days.   Yes I think we would match a large portion in BOND though. We can put locks in place.   Our liquidity is currently on main net and is incentivized for a few more weeks, at which point we would want short term liquidity to move any liquidity over to Optimism from main net. Since it is shorter term, I am fine with this number being lower.   Expected date is early August (or earlier) depending on audits. We\u2019ve been building it for almost a year and its very very close.   Well, like I said earlier this is probably the most negotiable part of this proposal but we do need to move as much liquidity as possible to Optimism because that is where governance and our DAO will live.   I\u2019m a little lost here - a ball park figure for what? I don\u2019t want to sound flippant here\u2026 I\u2019m just a little lost on the quotes and which piece you are asking for harder figures on.   Right now, we do have our product on Optimism (our SMART Alpha product). The 3M can obviously be lowered but I do think it is better if we have some portion of tokens in order to ensure that the DAO is activated on Optimism in an environment where less people are paying attention to defi.

I don\u2019t think anybody expected what BarnBridge set out to do to be easy, but it is important for those who aren\u2019t familiar with BarnBridge to recognize the important contributions it has made in the past and what it can do for the Optimism ecosystem going forward.   BarnBridge committed to moving its governance to Optimism back when \u201cthere-is-no-token-there-never-will-be\u201d was a channel on the OP Discord so was not doing this to get a grant. This highlighted an import benefit in that Optimism was a way for decentralized projects to make it economically viable for all governance holders to participate despite the value of their position.   BarnBridge takes a long-term perspective and is here to stay because it is committed to building something sustainable and would not waiver from that position even when TVL was leaving the system because market driven rates weren\u2019t good enough. At one point in time BarnBridge had over $600M in TVL which I think is realistic again because the protocol is well positioned for serious investors who want yield that they can count on without taking outsized risks.   I am familiar with the new governance framework and am confident that it will attract really smart people to focus on BarnBridge and Optimism. Also, I fully expect this DAO tooling to be something that others in the ecosystem borrow for their own protocols.   Because of the above I believe BarnBridge is deserving of a large allocation of OP tokens. We need to use these grants to incentivize protocols who have made important contributions and to get them to continue doing so on Optimism. I think this proposal does a nice job of incentivizing TVL, BOND liquidity on OP, the move of an entire DAO to Optimism, and builders. If I had to make one change, I would probably take 250k OP from the LP incentivization and give it to builders so both incentives are 750k. I also see valid points that can be made to extend time period for the Smart Yield allocation to be spread over 6 months instead of 3, but I think aggressively incentivizing liquidity early on will be the most effective way to increase and retain OP TVL.

I do want to say that I think everyone should know we will be happy to get whatever we can from the Optimism community we hope to be long term supporters of. We started building on Optimism and have vocalized our plans to move to Optimism for most of 2022 and this token allocation is really icing on the cake to something we wanted to do anyway. We had no idea there was ever even going to be a token involved.  I also am not a seed round investor in Optimism and my interest in BarnBridge moving to Optimism is specifically because of the caliber in community there. When we saw other amazing projects like Synthetix, AAVE, Uniswap, and all of the projects within the Synthetix ecosystem moving to Optimism\u2026 we knew that was a place real builders were moving. I also think BarnBridge taking a strong focus on being a long term sustainable source of fixed yield on Optimism will position both us, and Optimism for increased usage.  I think with what you saw from Luna/Terra\u2026 there is an absolute fit for fixed yield in crypto\u2026 however, the sustainability of that offering was always the question.  While we can\u2019t offer those types of rates sustainably\u2026 I think it still showed the product market fit for fixed income on L2s/side chains (i.e. not ETH main net). ",

OPUser:  Hey @lordtylerward , thank you for the update. Few comments my side to understand this proposal better.     lordtylerward:  bring sustainable liquidity to our platform on Optimism   how do you define this ? and how are you planning to do this ? **This is basically our side of this bargain and what Optimism is ultimately giving incentive for us to do. The entire mechanism of our new product intends to do this. ** I.e. the entire BarnBridge V2 does this. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been building the past 10 months.  Optimism LP: 25%  any specific pair ? Would you consider adding a OP token pair ? I thought about doing OP but it\u2019s kindof reflexive if we are giving OP as a token reward and then the pool is OP because it requires you to sell OP to buy BOND to increase your holding in the pool.  Builders: 25%  who will decide this part of distribution ? We should put a council in place on the BarnBridge side with active community members. If OP wants people on it we are fine with that.  Move BOND\u2019s governance: 16.67%  Please also explain, why do you need fund to move your DAO to OP chain ? Because of incentives. If it is half moved it creates a scenario where the funds could get locked on one chain or the other by not being able to meet quorum. So we are using incentives to prevent this. I also think people who actually vote on chain on Optimism will want a say in governing where BarnBridge\u2019s governance lives.  SMART Yield Users: 33.33%  what would a user need to do be part of this ? To deposit into our SMART Yield protocol.  e to this, we will have a unique way of providing liquidity to this system.  Could you share this \u201cunique\u201d way as this will give value to your proposal. So the DAO provides liquidity to the LP side (originally our Junior side is what we called it).  It pushes forward earned yield from the past month to be bid on in the upcoming month so you can ultimately take any type of variable annuity and change it into a fixed income stream. You could also, instead of depositing to AAVE, deposit into Curve or even Velodrome AMMs of stablecoin pairs to lock in a fixed rate from those variable annuities. This is what \u201cusing smart yield\u201d would mean in this context.  However, we expect our liquidity to far exceed the dollar value of this grant.  How ? do you have a plan or its just an intuition ? **I think if you look at our original TVL, the reason it dropped was turning off incentives. I don\u2019t see with adding back incentives in a more sustainable structure that the TVL would not increase. ** So yes it is an intiution but there is at least some basis rationally for the intuition where it isn\u2019t just hopes and dreams.  LP (BOND/USDC [or LUSD]): We want[\u2026]  This complete statement is not clear or uncertain.   Yeah I\u2019m not sure what I was saying here either. Right now we are leaning towards and ETH/BOND pool on Velodrome. ",

I\u2019m ultimately fine putting this into the next Phase of rewards if that is what people are looking for.  I think it is clear that there are a lot of people AGAINST this and i think it is because of the edits. At this point, I think we have made all of the final edits so the Snapshot reflects the settled changes. By the next rewards cycle we will already be on Optimism with all of the changes made it will just make it more difficult on our end to move to Optimism due to the delay. But ultimately, I understand that and am still committed to moving to Optimism as we were one of the first protocols that originally started putting our products on Optimism over a year ago. ",

It took longer than we expected to rebuild the protocol but at this point, with us moving things over, we have encouraged people not to make long duration deposits (year long locks) before we release SYV2. I think both the reward reduction and active advice not to deposit long lock periods\u2026 it would be like if Curve turned off rewards and actively encouraged people not to deposit. So our plan would be to start rewards back now that we have a sustainable mechanism. This grew our TVL to $600m in the past. ",

                    "content": "I answered the 16% in another answer. We are ultimately moving our entire DAO to Optimism that has $30m of assets in it (with a lot being front weighted to our own token but still, millions of dollars in non-BOND delineated assets. In my opinion, this component is the largest reason I\u2019m concerned with moving our DAO to Optimism because you create an issue where we may not have a quorum worthy amount to bring those users onto Optimism. We won\u2019t be the first DAO to want to move to a Layer 2\u2026 and this is going to be the largest barrier to moving over is the incentive to do so vs. just staying put and incurring gas fees (especially for smaller BOND deposits who it can end up costing as much as their entire bag to move over). I think this should exist as a case study in how we actually are getting people to move over in the first place. It will become a much larger problem as gas fees increase for projects if L2s want to alleviate barriers in moving over.  I think gas fees on main net will eventually get to $5k/transaction (not just myself\u2026 but people like Kain and Stani say the same thing). It\u2019s not an issue right now, because I\u2019m being proactive in moving to Optimism for this reason but the L2s helping projects with this large migration so DAOs don\u2019t get gridlocked or exist in two separate places is going to be something that we aren\u2019t the first ones to deal with. Since there isn\u2019t a framework for it and we are one of the first protocols to launch a DAO on Ethereum and migrate it to an L2\u2026 I\u2019m not sure I have a bulletproof answer on why 16% vs. wanting to ensure we had enough. At this point, if we get gridlocked we\u2019ll have to double our own incentives and cost so the intention here is we thought Optimism might want to support us in this migration. While it\u2019s off the docket for this phase and our DAO will already be moved over by the next phase\u2026 I can help with ensuring BarnBridge acts as a use case for this going forward.  I actually think this is the most important part of this proposal & we\u2019re too far down the rabbit hole of moving to Optimism that we\u2019ll do it with or without incentives. LP We are in active talks with the Velodrome team. We have main net LP incentives running for another 8 weeks so this is something we are in active communication about (which LP exactly).  We also need to vote on this on our end but the proposal should be ready this week or the week after. Someone asked if we would pair OP to make a BOND/OP pool.  The reason I\u2019m hesitant to do this is it will cause sell pressure on the OP price if rewards are getting dropped in OP (people receive and pair it back down). For us to pair it with BOND so incentives are in OP and BOND, that alleviates that issue but I don\u2019t think we will have Optimism rewards by the time we migrate so I think we chose the most liquid pair and go with what our governance and community asks for the initial pair to be. Council We haven\u2019t voted to put a council in place.  With voter apathy and the cost to vote on main net we are bundling a lot of this up into 1 or 2 large votes before voter costs are cheaper. So as we gear up for the launch of BarnBridge v2\u2026 most of this stuff will be put in place. We\u2019ve had conversations in the community and generally know the answers to all these questions but we need to do our large vote before these #s are hard numbers because ultimately I\u2019m not the CEO of BarnBridge so I can just signal what the expectation is but I can\u2019t promise exactly who will be on the council.  I think across the board this should explain why some of this feels disorganized vs. we can only be so organized with hard expectations until around 3 weeks from now. Final thoughts Some of the outcome of this proposal were what would solidify answers in our community proposals so part of why we were waiting was to get clarity on what we were distributing as a # of OP and then building it into our proposals to move. We ultimately have more to lose here than Optimism by moving our entire DAO over and risking the gridlock that would be pretty existentially bad for our project which is why we wanted to know the # on the OP end before we solidified those #s on our end. I think some of the original asks were that the amount was too high and we amended it down but not as many people came back and talked about it after seeing the higher # OP ask, unfortunately. So I wasn\u2019t sure what the main hangups were.  Hopefully this provides clarity. ",

Re Proposal: The updated 600K is still a high ask for the size of the project but more reasonable. Seeing the product and DAO on Optimism is nice and some incentives for users to move over make sense too. We still see a large focus on short-term incentives and at the same time we don\u2019t believe fixed income will be a huge growth driver in the next year(s) - hence, we welcome more building initiatives. We agree that LPing for Bond-USDC/ETH makes more sense than coupling Bond with OP as it\u2019s most important to make your token accessible through the Optimism network. General note: Lots of proposals try to move TVL to Optimism which does not equate to growth of the Op ecosystem and economy. Liquidity is definitely one of the keys to jumpstart and run ecosystems but we hope to see differentiated proposals that outline positive effects on Optimism growth. ",
