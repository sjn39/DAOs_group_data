                    "content": "Participating in Token House governance will require a serious time commitment. For this reason, we will strongly encourage people claiming OP in Airdrop #1 (and future Airdrops) to delegate the voting power of their tokens to a community member who has explicitly volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance. These volunteers are called delegates. If you\u2019d like to show up as a delegate on our voting portal, please head to our voting portal and connect your wallet to complete your profile according to the below template.  Understanding the Optimistic Vision and Collective Constitution Delegation is a commitment to the Optimism Collective. If you haven\u2019t done so already, you should read and understand the Optimistic Vision and Collective Constitution documents. The Optimistic Vision paints a picture for what the Optimism Collective is attempting to do in the long-term. The Collective Constitution explains how, practically, we aim to bring this vision to life. Familiarizing yourself with these documents is crucial to being an effective delegate.  What it means to be a delegate Delegates are a critical part of the Optimism Collective governance model. Without delegates we cannot effectively translate individual needs and wants into Collective action. Becoming a delegate is a commitment to engage actively in the governance of the Optimism Collective for the benefit of the Collective\u2019s citizenry. Although the exact roles and asks of a delegate will likely change over time, delegates are expected to shoulder the following key responsibilities:  Read, understand, and provide any necessary feedback on governance forum posts. Think critically and give input on governance experiments that will define the future of the Collective. Explore new ways to improve the Optimism Collective as a whole, whether by technical improvements, governance changes, or any other means. Understand Optimism network parameters and how these parameters can be tuned to ensure that the core Optimism network functions optimally for all network participants. Actively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when helpful. Promote the Collective\u2019s cultural values by setting a positive example for the general public.   Compensation for delegates Acting as a delegate is expected to be a significant amount of effort and should be treated as a serious commitment. Just as the Optimism Collective aims to fairly and adequately reward the creation of public goods, the Collective will aim to fairly and adequately reward its delegates. Delegates will eventually receive compensation for this significant time commitment once the role has stabilized.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes I understand. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: I want to help. I have seen too many public goods fall or end up hostage to their providers and compromise. We are in a critical state of our society where the vision needs to be shifted, valuable things and money are not the same and this rule should be applied when considering public goods. I want to help identify and promote these value creators so they can positively impact our future and profit from it. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I believe this is the first step to abandoning the old nation-state system for a more global, inclusive, and sophisticated society. The Optimism Collective will seed new education systems. Open, disinterested, and nonpolitical associated media that will inform curated facts and not only manipulated opinions. New digital ways to rapidly identify problems and the most impactful solutions and more! I always felt my optimism squeezed by corporations without personal profit. This vision is a paradigm shift and we will see more and more talent attracted to it, we all want to do good and live from it. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: My opinion is we won\u2019t see a permanent bedrock constitution in 4 years. We will see an adaptive, flowing, and always changing code, guarded by a new collective. We live in constant change, the constitution needs to be born, live, die, and decompose to nurture the next constitution. In 4 years a new constitution will be set for the next 4 years and so on. When society makes 2 steps ahead usually also tends to consolidate power, which leads to stagnation and crisis. In a futile attempt to maintain the consolidated power usually those in power take society 1 step backward. If we want to always move forward, power consolidation must always be avoided. My Web3 interests: DAOs, Economics, Gaming, Governance, Social impact Languages I speak and write: Spanish (native), English My skills and areas of expertise: I did a career in game design and later architecture. I understand the surface of coding, graphic design, storytelling like hero\u2019s journey, gaming loop, etc. Working as an architect I lead teams of up to 200 people in building residential towers. This combo drove me into EthernautDAO where I act as DAO PM keeping everything functioning and pushing the project forward while maintaining full openness to new ideas and learning from others. I consider myself always at an unknowledgeable level and this keeps me humble and open to new ideas and opinions. I avoid confrontation 100% of the time.

We\u2019re Penn Blockchain (@PennBlockchain on twitter), a leading, completely student run blockchain organization from The University of Pennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools. The club currently has over 50 members and we\u2019re expecting many more in the semesters to come! Penn Blockchain has committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Business Development, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team has different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we have delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, IndexCoop, Maker, etc. Each week, governance leads will share updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about what to do before voting with our wallet. We\u2019d love to be your $OP delegate as many of us have been closely following Optimism for a while now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of expertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to leave their impact and names in Web3. My view on the Optimistic Vision: \u201cTogether, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.\u201d We couldn\u2019t have put it better ourselves. The ushering in of a new digital democratic governance used to drive rapid and sustained growth is one that resonates well with us, and something we entirely support! My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   This is a working constitution: We like the introductory period before the constitution becomes the Bedrock Constitution. As with most novel things, we will have to change and amend multiple things; this allows us to do just that.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective: We are in support of the bicameral governance system. As stated, short-term incentives and long term visions must be aligned.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model: We understand that the Optimism Foundation will at times have to step in. We expect, as well as are confident, that the Optimism Foundation will act in the best interest of the ecosystem.  My Web3 interests: Defi, DAOs, Gaming, NFT, Governance (and so much more, name one thing and we\u2019re confident multiple people in our club will share that similar interest) Languages I speak and write: The member spearheading the Optimism governance initiative (@juanbugeth on twitter) is fluent in English and Chinese. However, our club members\u2019 come from some of the most diverse countries in the world. Pretty much all of these languages are accounted for. My favorite Web3 projects: We currently help with governance for Maker, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, Aave, IndexCoop, etc.  ",

Wish I could offer you some grand statement, but it\u2019s just curiosity at this point. My view on the Optimistic Vision: Well, it\u2019s curiosity and also a novel vision. I despise the entirely plutocratic systems that pervade the crypto space (a large reason why I\u2019m a crypto-skeptic), and any attempt at breaking beyond it is worth contributing to. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   This is pretty obvious - you wouldn\u2019t have governance if the constitution wasn\u2019t a work-in-progress.   Finding a balance will be challenging, I believe more specific goals and targets need to be fleshed out by citizens and holders and embedded into the constitution.

I have worked significantly with Fuel Labs, contributed to the native bridges of both Optimism and Arbitrum, and have been working with Lito Coen and the L222 team to bring liquidity mining incentives to Ethereum rollups. I\u2019m very interested in further contributing to the L2 ecosystem by helping guide Optimism\u2019s governance moving forward. Furthermore, I am a founder of CryptoStats, a public-goods project that will be deploying on Optimism within the coming weeks, and I believe the interests of CryptoStats and Optimism are heavily alligned. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I was inspired by last week\u2019s Bankless episode, outlining the Optimism Collective and the path forward for this project. Specifically, I believe project that are mission driven (such as Optimism with their mission to fund public goods) will allow for growth that extends beyond pre-existing use-cases. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution  Strongly agree. Decentralized governance still has a long way to go to becoming mature, and there is a need to be open to changing and experimenting Agreed, very excited to see this experiment in expanding governance beyond the plutocracy of coin-voting, while still maintining a fungable token Agreed, the foundation model has worked well for other web3 projects  My Web3 interests: Choose \u2264 five from the following set.

It has been a delight watching the community form and the network grow across every metric. As a delegate, I promise to represent fellow Optimism builders, users, and believers in Ethereum. I tell pretty much whoever will listen that rollups are broadband for blockchains and that they will change the world. As a delegate, I can help make this a reality and play a small role in scaling Ethereum to the masses. My view on the Optimistic Vision: The most important line in the vision is, \u201cThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable .\u201d Hindsight is 20/20, and for the first time, we can use it to our advantage to allocate capital (and potentially other resources) to public goods! When I first learned about public goods theory in an Economics class, the professor spoke of their unprofitably and underfunded nature as a given. I want the Collective to prove them wrong! I think RPGF presents a new paradigm for human coordination. Today it directs funding to web3 devs who built useful tools, but tomorrow it can and will do so much more. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  The transitory nature is good. In four years we will have a MUCH better idea of what effective governance looks like for crypto networks. I have always encouraged L2s to experiment (previously in development but now in governance) and am happy there is a commitment to it. This is ambitious but I have nothing but praise. I am genuinely excited for the first Holder vs. Citizen conflict and think the Collective will come out of it stronger. In my view this early level of control is necessary. I only ask that the Foundation maintain a rigorous internal process for treasury allocation and publish some sort of regular transparency report. I do not think the Foundation should ever be arbitrarily forced to dissolve. It should remain a steward and driving force for ecosystem growth and will naturally be made redundant by other actors.

Not everyone needs to work on a VC-funded for-profit soul-crashing startup that gives nothing back to the world. My view on the Optimistic Vision: In short I dig it. The main thing that pushed me to get actively involved in Gitcoin DAO was the goal of funding public goods. Only for my specific case public goods is the much more specific and hard case of opensource software. The idea of finding ways to make opensource software sustainable by providing incentives to those who build them is something that excites me and fills me with purpose. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I find them logical. (1) Makes sense. Things will evolve. (2) Intrigued to see how the bicameral governance of checks and balances will end up working out.

I organized a Scaling Now conference and interview series in 2018 and worked with Hermez (Now Polygon Hermez a public goods focused rollup) on and off over the years. I would like to get deeper into the scaling community! Optimism is very aligned with my values of solving Public Goods funding issues with novel economic driven win-win systems. I would like to help in any way that I can, and given that I am a Delegate for ENS and Gitcoin this seems to be the most obvious way to help. Also, I LOVE experimental governance systems and as a delegate I will get to be on the forefront of how we tune parameters as a community, and I love that stuff!  My view on the Optimistic Vision : \u201cPositive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.\u201d This is exactly what I spend every waking hour working towards. \u201cWe imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world.\u201d I work towards this future everyday with Giveth, bridging web3 incentive models to meatspace is the dream and we are doing it! Giveth is going straight into the physical world, but Commons Stack (as well as Gitcoin) is also taking the pragmatic approach and starting with areas that are relevant to our work (Token Engineering) and building solutions for that. I agree with starting with Public Goods in the Optimism and Ethereum space and then venturing out as we grow. I have never been as aligned with a vision of a crypto project that wasn\u2019t one I helped to found.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Love the humble Experimental approach, 4 years is definitely enough time to come to a steady state solution. I like the citizen approach, I couldn\u2019t find the on-boarding or off-boarding info for Citizens, but that will be an interesting experiment, that OP has already prototyped in their first Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round. As far as the Cayman Islands thing, that\u2019s cool. Thats similar to the set up of ENS, but at the same time, I\u2019m a little sad to see it cause I remember when OP launched, it was a B-corp and honestly I was really hoping they found a repeatable way for a B-corp to tokenize with delegated governance! Expectations are the root of all disappointment. I haven\u2019t read the charter for the foundation (couldn\u2019t find it), but hopefully its board is beholden to the decision of the governance system, otherwise the governance will be a farce, and the board are a shadow third check not stated in the design (just being real here). Really excited to have methods to tune parameters as a delegate, I hope we have some cool dashboards to play with and take some lessons learned from other projects that do similar like mstable, TEC, 1inch, etc.  My Web3 interests: DAOs, Economics, Governance, Identity, Social impact  Languages I speak and write:  English and a little Spanish  My skills and areas of expertise:  I\u2019ve been a contributing member of the Ethereum community since 2015 & received a masters degree in Digital Currency in 2016 (first degree of any kind ever given in digital currencies). As community manager for Slock.it and TheDAO, I helped form the community around TheDAO and led every angle of the crisis response effort following TheDAO Hack. I co-founded the White Hat Group, which secured the at-risk funds (10% of the total supply of ETH) during TheDAO hack and one year later rescued $210 million dollars worth of crypto assets following the Parity Multisig Hack. I also audited Aragon and MakerDAO systems with the WHG. In 2016, I co-founded Giveth, a donation platform similar to Gitcoin, we have the best donation platform in the world giveth.io  where 100% of the donations go to the project and we have the web3 version of a tax-deduction where our token $GIV is given to the donors, it is a web3 public goods lego that i hope optimism can use for their own public goods funding approach (free tokens on top of your donation, why not?) I co-founded DAppNode in early 2018 to ensure the p2p world has true hardware decentralization. I co-founded the Commons Stack in 2019. The Commons Stack is the natural progression of Giveth\u2019s efforts to build the future of giving from a Token Engineering perspective with a goal of creating Public Good focused economies. Our first Commons, the Token Engineering Commons, launched earlier this year and we did a lot of interesting community parameterization. I also co-founded a project still in stealth mode called General Magic which is a sort of a Service DAO like Raid Guild but focused on supporting Impact DAOs. I have contributed to dozens of other projects as well, most notably, iden3, Hermez, and brightID and continue to support all 3 in an advisory capacity. Hermez (now Polygon Hermez) is especially relevant as it is also a public goods focused rollup. I also lead 2 crypto focused burning man camps, Decentral and Blockhaus  Look me up if you want to burn with THE crypto camp on playa.

We\u2019ve worked with projects like Compound, dYdX, and Uniswap on several high-impact initiatives (e.g., DeFi Education Fund, running an auction process to hire an auditor for Compound, and the dYdX Grants Program. As part of our work, Reverie is an active voter in the governance processes of projects we\u2019re involved with. We believe great projects need great governance. Our motivation to be a delegate is simple: we care about governance, are excited about Optimism, and as a result, want to be involved in the governance process! My view on the Optimistic Vision 11: For better or worse, the easiest way to get great people to do great things in a capitalist system is to pay them. As a general matter, we\u2019re very aligned with the idea that (i) money is a thing that can be used to get great people to do great stuff, (ii) the more money (profits) you have, the more great people you can get and the more great stuff you can do, and (iii) public goods can generate a profit, and that profit can be re-invested into more public goods (read: great people). It won\u2019t all be rosy (there are plenty of private, rent-seeking actors masquerading as public goods entities), but with the right people sitting at the \u201cprofit allocation table,\u201d we believe the goal is an achievable one. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: We think it\u2019s fair to say we don\u2019t know exactly what Optimism will look like in three to five years. As a result, we don\u2019t think it makes sense to have rigid rules around governance \u2014 a rigid constitution around a fluid and emergent technology/community would significantly slow the growth of the ecosystem. To that end, we really like the idea of fluid governance. My Web3 interests: Governance, DeFi, Economics, and DAOs.

Our view on the Optimistic Vision: Blockchain at Berkeley, as a non-profit, student organization focused on onboarding individuals into the crypto space through a technical-first value driven approach, supports the Optimistic Vision. We see the failure of our market to reward individuals based on collective impact, which we want to steer the Web3 community away from. Furthermore, we see the need for the Web3 space to scale in terms of values. The crypto space emerged due to philosophical ideals of anonymity and decentralization, and has grown to value composability, forming communities, and defining ownership.

We are committed to pushing the boundaries and being experimental with OP governance for the goal of developing a well informed permanent constitution when the collective is mature. We see the need for a more rigid structure overtime - but hope to contribute greatly to the collective\u2019s experimental years of self-determination. We believe OP\u2019s bi-cameral system will be the force that ensures positive impact is profitable. Simple fungible token governance can create unhealthy dynamics - decisions made based on token price, consolidation of voting power, buying votes for selfish reasons, etc. Onboarding citizens who care about the success of the protocol - and not attaching a price tag to their vote - will help defend against these trends we have seen play out in other protocols. The dynamic between $OP holders and OP Citizens will create a system of checks and balances that we believe will be equilibrium of digital governance. We view progressive decentralization as a necessity in our space - and we are grateful the Optimism Foundation will oversee stewardship of the Collective in its youth. We trust as the Collective matures and decentralizes its voting power, control over Optimism will be handed over. We hope to help aid in maturing governance.

We\u2019re Blockchain@Hopkins (@blockchain_jhu on Twitter), the student blockchain club at Johns Hopkins University for all of our schools (undergraduate, graduate, business, even medical!). We\u2019re currently a group of over 100 members, with a core unit focused exclusively on contributing to protocols in the form of governance, development, and white-hat. As a student-run club, we take decentralized governance very seriously and think of ways to be a crypto-native as possible. Via our governance team, we\u2019re piloting an internal governance token, built on Polygon, which is an attempt to provide our club members and university students globally with a chance to learn, and contribute to our own club and manage our treasury and consequently fund public goods that contribute to the club such as educational courses, events, hackathons, outside development, white-hat, etc. By actively contributing to the club mission, members earn the erc-20 governance token, which gives club members voting authority on the treasury allocation and more. One of our main focus areas (both in research teams and in practice via our development team) has been projects such as Gitcoin. We are excited to further this interest by contributing to the OP Ecosystem both from a policy perspective and a technical one. Our (planned) Optimism governance committee is composed of 2 Cryptography PhD Students (focused on rollup technologies), The 3 other students major in Computer Science, Economics, Sociology and International Relations. The governance committee works very closely with the research team to analyze emerging trends in DAOs and tokenomics. We are also advised by Prof. Matthew Green, Ph.D. (part of the founding team of Zcash) and Prof. Jim Liew (Prof of Finance and Cryptocurrencies) It is imperative that in order for the Collective to be equitable and democratic, it needs to be inhabited by people from a diverse background that possess general proficiency about the strengths and limitations of web3 technologies and have the passion and drive to actually participate in the governance process. We believe that \u2013 for reasons we already elucidated \u2013 our student body is fit to advance the Collective to that direction. My view on the [Optimistic Vision] First and foremost, we love OP\u2019s idea of retroactive incentives. While retroactive incentives with clear and definite deployment are rare in a worldly context, in the context of the information age, we agree that retroactive incentives can be implemented fairly, using blockchain and other web3 technologies. We also believe that the Collective is well-equipped to accomplish this task of deploying capital for public goods, in an ideal democracy. That\u2019s why a lot of us got into blockchains \u2013 To participate in a more perfect meritocracy with impact aligned profit. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: We are encouraged by the nature of the Constitution being elastic. As we were piloting our token, one of the most important things we had to do is iteratively work on not only the guiding principles but also the tokenomics and implementation of agreed-upon proposals. As OP\u2019s collectively growing, we think it\u2019s important to be flexible. The bicameral structure of OP\u2019s governance is one of the most interesting experiments in the blockchain governance space to date. Assuming that there is a proper accountability practice in place, adding an additional \u2018house\u2019 that isn\u2019t bound by the market condition of the governance token is surely going to align with the longer term goal of the Collective. We are excited and optimistic (heh) to see it come to fruition. We love that the eventual goal for the foundation is to be decentralized. We believe that while it might be easier to strategically start with a more centralized model (as we initially started), we are true believers that at scale, decentralization is fundamental.

We believe that Optimism represents an important public good within the Ethereum ecosystem and as such, must be governed in a careful and considered manner. Wildfire and _\u200b:fire: have made thoughtful and effective contributions to many governance systems including ENS and Gitcoin. We are excited to bring this context and experience to OP governance.  My view on the Optimistic Vision: Wholeheartedly agree. The OP vision is the vision of Ethereum; fostering a layer two ecosystem which is value-aligned with Ethereum and the ethos of public goods is of utmost importance. Wildfire believes that Optimism is the L2 which has both the technical and directional capacity to provide the much needed scalability to the Web3 community.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1. \"This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution\" Wildfire believes that taking the first step of governance by establishing a working constitution is not just prudent, but necessary. Good governance requires flexibility and forethought, especially when it comes to a nascent space such as ours. A commitment to experimentation also means a commitment to improvement, and we at Wildfire agree wholeheartedly with this approach. Finally, the four-year limit on the working constitution also demonstrates a thoughtful beginning for the Collective,  by enabling a regular review of decision-making power and how it flows in the Optimism Collective. Wildfire fully concurs. 2. \"OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.\" If Optimism Collective wants to accomplish the task of retroactively funding public goods and driving sustainable growth in the decentralized ecosystem, it is critical that its government does not become a tokenized plutocracy. We strongly support the fact that Optimism has proposed a governance model that aims for equality and for putting checks and balances in place for the different bodies involved in decision making. _\u200b:fire: and Wildfire are excited to play a roll in both sides of the Optimism Collective. 3. \"The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.\" At Wildfire, we are confident that the Optimism Foundation will protect the interests of the ecosystem when it has to be involved in decision making.

I really appreciate how Optimism is using technology for positive social impact, putting purpose and not just profit front and center and fostering public goods development for the long term benefit of everyone. This is refreshing and equally reassuring at this point in the crypto adoption cycle. I\u2019ve contributed to MakerDAO\u2019s mission since 2018, being part of the Foundation team and now (after being part of the Foundations dissolution) a contributor to the DAO on the Maker Growth Core Unit. I believe it\u2019s incredibly important that everyone has the optionality into DeFi. Affordable and secure transactions are key to bring decentralized services to people everywhere.This is why I want to participate in Optimism. My view on the Optimistic Vision 9: Building public goods funding and creation into the mechanism design of Optimism and by default Ethereum, gives us the best chance to create a system that inherently gives back to its users in a net positive way. Intentionality creates positive momentum and incentives help keep that momentum. I\u2019m all for reshaping behavior in this area! My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  This is an honest and realistic design approach. New models need time to be tested and emerge from theory to practice. It\u2019s not easy stuff. Having two key focus areas to orient action and decision making seems like a logical way to avoid distractions and minimize inefficiencies. Like anything in its infancy, having guidance from a Foundation and dedicated \u201ccaretakers\u201d is crucial to create the right frameworks for the Collective to operate in and eventually become self-sustaining (\u201cfly from the\u2019'nest\u201d)  My Web3 interests: DAOs, DeFi, Identity, Infrastructure, Social Impact, NFTs, Privacy Languages I speak and write: English My skills and areas of expertise: Business Development, Decentralized Governance, Strategy My favorite Web3 projects: Maker (current contributor :), Maple Finance, Async Art ",

By retroactively rewarding those who create public goods, we make the \u201cgood\u201d decision the rational one. This is an amazing concept, and The Optimism Collective combined with RPGF is the best chance humanity has had so far to make it work. Let\u2019s summon that phoenix.   My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1: This is such a novel coordination experiment, that I don\u2019t think there is any other way than to have a \u201cworking\u201d constitution. I\u2019m looking forward to the experimentation of The Optimism Collective. 2: I also believe that both are necessary, but I think there are other ways to describe this than just \u201cshort term incentives vs long term vision\u201d. The Token House is the home of economic incentives and The Citizen\u2019s House is the home of community incentives (positive externalities). 3: I accept the necessity of this article, and I am confident in the current members of the Optimism Foundation based on their record.

In the long run, the societal impact of primarily profit-seeking platforms has been largely negative. In the face of all this, Ethereum has been an incredible demonstration of the premise that Impact = Profit. While it was not clear initially that ETH would accrue value, by attracting millions of developers and users who built open-sourced applications and tools considered public goods, the holders of ETH greatly benefited from a community formed around shared beliefs. The Optimism ecosystem is in a particularly challenging position, where given the EVM-equivalence, most public goods built for/on Ethereum can benefit Optimism and vice-versa. As a scaling solution to Ethereum, it is important to balance value accrual towards OP and ETH so that the ecosystems are symbiotic in the long run. \u201cThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable\u201d.

Optimism has the opportunity to carefully craft incentive structures around distributing OP and rewarding public goods given a large percentage of these incentives across User Airdrops, RetroPGF and Ecosystem Fund have not been distributed yet. My view on the first three articles of the [Working Constitution]:  Working constitution:   A commitment to experimentation - Creativity and experimentation seem to have stalled a bit in the space, especially in regard to economic incentives for contributors.

Then in quick succession (not sure which was first) I read a Bankless article on Moloch (and then the Slate Star Codex article that it references) and the book Ministry for The Future, in which one of the key components in saving the biosphere from global warming is a complete overhaul of the financial world through a crypto currency called Carbon Coin. Great book, go read it. From that point on this idea that Ethereum was just an interesting tech project to learn about or a valuable investment seemed almost quaint. I\u2019ve been enthralled by projects like Gitcoin, Klima, and now Optimism. The concept of Ethereum\u2019s Phoenix, using the incentive structures of retroactive public goods funding to encourage behaviours with positive externalities seems completely revolutionary, it might well be what we need to overcome the Great Filter of climate change that we are barreling towards, and even if it\u2019s not then it will almost certainly be the Schelling point around which the people who do develop even better mechanisms converge. I want to be as involved as I can. My view on the Optimistic Vision : We have seen in the legacy world that relying on charity and altruism is not sufficient to tackle the biggest problems we face as a species. By flipping the incentives to reward actions that contribute to public goods the Optimistic Vision changes the game from one where freeloading and exploiting the commons benefits the individual more than the shared community cost effects them, to a system where finding the ways to produce the most positive effect with your capital will end up being the most financially rewarding choice. Starting with public goods in Optimism and the broader Ethereum ecosystem is like ensuring your own oxygen mask and your family\u2019s are fitted first when an aircraft cabin loses pressure. In the long run though, my optimistic view is that we get to the cabin and take over from the unconscious pilot in time to avoid crashing to a fiery doom. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Articles 1 and 3 seem almost obvious at this stage of the collective. The first for exactly the reasons described in the constitution document itself and the third as a necessity for any governance organization in it\u2019s infancy. It is entirely understandable that the roles taken on by the Foundation are not feasible to be managed by the Token and Citizen houses initially. It seems unlikely that the undefined \u2018Take other actions that are conducive to its stewardship role\u2019 will be exploited to, for example, buy Ben Jones a yacht\u2026! Article 2 is or course the most exciting part of the Optimism Collective\u2019s Working Constitution. I am extremely interested to see how the creation of Citizens will take place and how Sybil resistance will be maintained, however the idea of having part of the governance control based on permanent members with long term incentives, rather than having all the power effectively purchasable through token trading is very appealing. I think that it is becoming increasingly well recognized that airdropped token governance is inadequate on it\u2019s own. It is good to reward active participants in a project, but when many (most) airdrops get sold and governance power is then available to whoever can pay for it it is inevitable that we will recreate the plutocracy of the legacy world. By balancing this with OP citizens, issued with a single soulbound voting token the possibility for long term decision making seems much improved.

While the specifics of planetary atmospheres and deceleration of spacecraft isn\u2019t directly useful to crypto governance, the general skills of objective analysis and investigating problems that are beyond the current frontier of human knowledge seems to have a lot of crossover with what we\u2019re building and discovering in this new field of coordination structures. As a secondary interest I have worked on projects trying to understand and improve community resistance to manipulation in Web 2, assisting investigative journalists analysing Russian influence campaigns, constructing the \u2018Web of Lies\u2019 map of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s spin-offs, funders, clients etc and building the Trollfare wiki of research on disinformation. If you check my Twitter you will see almost nothing crypto related \u2013 for that my social media of choice is Reddit, usually trying to answer questions and correct misunderstandings in r/ethereum and learning from the wise minds in r/ethfinance. My favorite Web3 projects: [optional] List \u2264 3 projects Curve (for the 90\u2019s style UI), Sign In With Ethereum (can\u2019t wait for it to be the norm online), and GreenPill (what do you mean a podcast and a Telegram group isn\u2019t Web 3\u2026).

The idea of The Optimistic Vision and bicameral governance system changed my opinion on how I used to look at a project. This is what was missing from the web3 space, an idea of giving power to the users, not just the token holder but everyone. You can be a builder, contributor, community member and working toward building a better digital and web3 space. An idea to make public good profitable with retroactive incentives. This digital space is moving quite fast, from Vitalik\u2019s whitepaper in 2013 to roll-ups and zkp in just 8 year, we have come a long way, from Bitcoin P2P idea to smart contract to metaverse to digital identity but we don\u2019t see any impact of this movement in physical world. With public good, we can change this. With my application to be a part of delegate community, I want to part of this movement, work together, provide feedback, seek guidance and the same time guiding and offering help. This is movement where a project can be more than just a token and I want to make it happen. Sure, we might fall at first, but iteratively, we learn, and we will succeed. If I have to say this in one line, I would like quote Vitalik\u2019s opinion on this Governance model as I totally agree with him \u201cPossibly the biggest attempt at non-token-holder-centric DAO governance so far. Excited to see where this goes.\u201d My view on the Optimistic Vision: This is one of its of its kind approach to incentive users on the basis of fairness ratio, where public good leading to incentives which in turn going to impact whole web3 space. There was a need to bridge the gap between crypto and physical world, and I believe \u201cOptimistic Vision\u201d can be that bridge. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   This is a working constitution : \u201cA commitment to experimentation\u201d, this is what really motivates me, and I agree with this. Grow and evolve by doing experiment, iteratively.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : This is yet to be seen, sounds good on paper but implementation can be challenging. Finding the balance between short-term incentives with its long-term vision would be a difficult task but again this a governance model of its kind, we need to see if we can do this with OP holder and OP Citizens. Four year is a long time in digital fast-moving space, and I am OPtimistic about it.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model : Yes, I agree with this, at this early stage some steering is necessary. Although, in long I would like to see a self-governing decentralized OP Foundation.

My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: I\u2019ve been part of the DeFi LATAM (a top latin-american-focused community) since a year ago and we\u2019re truly interested in the future of Ethereum and Web3. In many contexts, Latam has been behind the scenes (a vibrant adoption) but our participation as a regional community in formal instances has not been enough until now. At Latam we want to change that and insert in the best possible way all the talent that the users of our +20 Latam countries have. Said this, as a delegate, we want to work with our communities to coordinate a credible representation of all those truly interested in the future of Web3 and Optimism from the perspective of our region, DeFi LATAM and other communities. Scaling Ethereum is the most important topic to global adoption, and we are willing to collaborate so that there are no barriers in this part of the world and raise our voice. My view on the Optimistic Vision: the internet has connected all the people in the world, and now we must do the same in the Internet of value. On the other hand, systematically we have seen the problem of public goods at the government level; but, under initiatives like this, things can definitely be different and we will be there to bring our vision. I personally expect to see criticism and contributions to the optimistic view based on our experience on this side of the world. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:    We believe that governance will mature over time while meeting its objectives. From our perspective, we consider 4 years is a good goal to start, but would not be enough in case new technologies arrive that change the paradigms and points of view, we need to be prepared for any scenario but always pursue a consolidation at 4 years.     We have seen how the classic governance model is not sustainable over the time or makes it vulnerable in certain circumstances. This is critical when governance applies not only over a protocol but all a scaling solution and its protocols inside. A bicameral governance system is a first good step but we are looking to research on improving this aspect.     By now this is a mandatory step but we are looking to expand and open the different roles as soon as feasible and then have diversity in the vision of the future of the protocol.    My Web3 interests: DeFi, Governance, Identity, Social Impact. Languages I speak and write: Spanish (as native), English (improving over the time).

But, like so many others, I felt frustrated by the slow adoption of these projects. In being a delegate I see another hands-on opportunity to grow the success of the ecosystem\u2014in this case by helping guide Optimism protocol decisions. As the founder and owner of several technology businesses I understand the importance of having a strong advisory board, which I would consider myself part of for Optimism. One of my businesses is also a PoS validator operator, so I am already familiar with the responsibility of being delegated tokens and voting responsibly on behalf of my delegators. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I believe the invention of blockchain technology and web3 will be one of the most important milestones in human technological progress. But only if the citizens of our young and fragile community can steer the technology into the right direction and keep it ahead of profit-driven corporations and bad actors. The Optimistic Vision lays out one such approach, and I would be honored to help guide the Optimism community into the right direction. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: As someone already working to transform a relatively new DAO with 5,000 members into a truly decentralized organization, I am well aware of the need to iterate collective governance. It takes a steady hand at the steering wheel until the organization has learned to steer itself, and the Optimism Foundation\u2019s role and leadership is critical until true decentralization is reached.

I am excited about implementing a sybil resistant system in which we create a Citizen\u2019s House that consist from actually caring participants & cannot be manipulated the same way the coin voting is being manipulated today. I agree and hope that Optimism Foundation will be the entity that doesn\u2019t let us diverge from the mission.

But really, I\u2019ve spent the last 5 years putting my heart and soul into funding public goods as a co-founder of Gitcoin. Over that time, we\u2019ve seen projects like Dune Analytics, Ethers.js, Snapshot, Uniswap, WalletConnect, Yearn, and of course Plasma Group (now Optimism) reach sustainability in a variety of ways that are only possible thanks to Ethereum. While I\u2019m proud of the impact we\u2019ve been able to have, I believe that to scale our work further it is crucial that we do more to dispel the myth that public goods aren\u2019t profitable. Having connected with @optimistprime and others on the Optimism team so much over the years, and worked closely with them via Gitcoin, I\u2019m confident that they will be able to help achieve this goal, both thanks to the sheer talent on their team and their broader values alignment. My view on the Optimistic Vision: Public goods are often discussed as goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. I submit that a better framing might be to consider public goods as goods that create positive externalities. In that framing, we can find plenty of examples of projects in Ethereum, including many DAOs, that are critical for the long term sustainability of web3. These projects should be financially rewarded such that they can not only survive, but thrive, and we now have new coordination and incentive mechanisms to ensure that happens in a way that benefits all market participants. In short, I believe in the optimistic vision for the same reason I believe in playing positive-sum games. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1. \"This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution\" Good governance means working flexibly and adjusting direction not only based on the will of the community but based on learnings that naturally happen as a DAO scales. Huge fan of this approach and especially a fan of the four year limit. Consensus > immutability. 2. \"OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.\" Love the idea of checks and balances across different decision-making bodies, and strongly agree with Vitalik here. Although DAO governance is a powerful tool, we need to be careful, just in other democratic systems, to avoid implicit or explicit plutocracy. 3. \"The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.\" I strongly agree with the idea of progressive decentralization and believe it\u2019s only natural for Optimism to focus in on the foundation to start and slowly expand its values and goals out to the community. A DAO without direction cannot achieve its goals, and there needs to be a core group that sets the initial conditions for future direction / growth.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: We look forward to leveraging our learnings from other protocols and the deep relationships our team has fostered across DeFi, TradFi, governments, and academics. GFX has a record of rolling up our sleeves and getting work done. The GFX team has authored half of all successful proposals on Uniswap (including the first cross-chain governance proposal), listed multiple assets and developed the price oracle on Compound, and led efforts at MakerDAO to interface with regulators, lawmakers, and outside researchers. We actively work to find mutual benefits for protocols we cover to collaborate \u2013 such as the soon-to-be deployed DAI Direct Deposit Module for MakerDAO to plug directly into Compound. Delegation to GFX Labs is a delegation to a governance team that is one of the most experienced in DeFi, able to facilitate partnerships, and with a track record of consistent engagement and delivery of results. GFX Labs isn\u2019t a fund. We don\u2019t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi. Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance. We promise to be active participants. We\u2019ll explain not only when we agree, but most importantly, when we disagree. As first-hand participants in governance, we know how frustrating it is to work on a proposal, receive limited comments, only to have the proposal shot down at launch. Our door will always be open to those who share the passion for DeFi that we have. My view on the Optimistic Vision: GFX has a passion for building and optimizing protocols and the Web3 ecosystem generally. Our past record shows a commitment to the same ideals expressed in the Optimistic Vision \u2013 collaboration, coordination, and democratization of everything Web3. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article 1: Experimentation is appropriate, but past experience at major protocols suggests experimentation should be done with specific goals in mind. An ability to experiment early on is worthwhile, but needs to be tempered with an ability to commit once a winning formula has been found. Article 2: A bicameral structure should in theory provide a more robust set of checks and balances, but only to the extent that OP Holder and OP Citizens are representative of differing constituencies. Shaping the criteria for the latter will be very important to get correct. Article 3: The Foundation-that-decentralizes-over-time model worked quite well for governing the Maker protocol. It will be important to have robust governance processes developed prior to the end of that journey, however, to insure institutional knowledge is retained and best practices continue after full decentralization.

I truly have a deep love for Ethereum and its values and would like to make a contribution in helping build a Collective Optimism. It\u2019s fantastic to even have this opportunity to participate in such an amazing adventure.  My view on the Optimistic Vision: With this new governance structure, it will be interesting to witness how the retroactive funding for public goods allows Optimism to grow and in turn how it can empower Ethereum to flourish. Being able to experiment gives Optimism more freedom and a better chance in getting a DDP (Digital Democratic Governance) to work\u2026properly!  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: The main takeaway would be that Optimism shares Ethereum core values and aims to achieve complete decentralization in the future. I am intrigued by the Working Constitution in this everchanging, face-paced, environment. I feel having the right principles and philosophy, will be key to the growth of Optimism and that is what I have experienced in the Optimism eco-system.

We have forty active members in our first semester on campus, and we\u2019re rapidly growing as this exciting space comes to the forefront of technology. We\u2019re interested in pursuing the vision that has been laid out by the Optimism Foundation, and followed by the Optimism community. We have both the technical and human capital necessary to contribute to the Optimistic future: our dedicated research team publishes articles on ambitious blockchain projects like Helium and Radix DLT, and we currently manage a governance delegation from a16z for dYdX. My view on the Optimistic Vision: We see public goods funding, and more generally the manifestation of selfish incentives through human-controlled power structures, as the root issues which cause many of the symptoms seen in modern society. Blockchains and similar decentralized technologies enable the redirection of human incentives in a way that no technology has enabled in the past. We must capture this opportunity to reinvent society for the better, and ensure that the technology does not fall into use for evil. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: The initial governance period will be highly dynamic. Progression towards a stable system is natural and necessary for long-term governance. We would like to see and/or contribute to a more fleshed-out definition of what \u201cbedrock\u201d constitution means, as we do not believe four years will be quite enough for a stable governance system to emerge. (This period covers only a single Bitcoin halving cycle: from a macro perspective, we cannot hope to capture all cyclical effects on society in just four years.) We believe in progressive decentralization as the path forward in web3. We are hopeful that blockchains and similar technologies will lead to a fairer and more equitable system for all, and we are eager to contribute our efforts to that future.

I have a good understanding of the Optimism network, and as a delegate I believe I can apply my knowledge to best represent the long term sustainability of the network and the safety of its users. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I\u2019m a strong proponent of retroactive public good funding. I participated in the first experiment as a badge-holder and engaged in conversations about taking it to the next level. I\u2019m thrilled to take part in the next steps. My long term vision goes beyond cyberspace. I see retroPGF as the perfect way to bring the power of the free market to make the world a better place. In particular I would like to experiment with retroPGF in the field of medical research, where the current incentive structure is broken and retroPGF could align it perfectly. If the Optimistic Vision proves successful, I hope we can replicate the model to kickstart similar ecosystems where they\u2019re needed the most. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution. - Definitely agree. Just seeing how much the ideas evolved in the past year, makes it obvious how much it still needs to evolve. I\u2019m thrilled to see what it\u2019ll look like in four years. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective. - I think this separation is a good start but I anticipate conflicts of interest that will require a more complex system. The bicameral system is a good way to start, but I expect it\u2019ll evolve into something we can\u2019t quite predict yet. The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.  - I understand why it\u2019s needed for pragmatic reasons, and the foundation model works well for other projects. I hope the foundation will maintain a high level of transparency and empower the bicameral governance system whenever possible.

I\u2019ve played a key role in shaping Balancer\u2019s governance process over the last two years and I hope to bring that expertise to the Optimism Collective. My view on the Optimistic Vision : I am a strong believer in the importance of funding public goods and was quite active contributing to Gitcoin back in 2020. The Optimistic Vision represents a massive step forward in Ethereum\u2019s commitment to public goods and I\u2019m very excited to see it come to life. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: It represents a refreshingly candid view on web3 governance - we don\u2019t expect to get it right from the beginning and instead begin the journey with an open mind, ready to experiment. Balancer has been through a few experiments of its own and even recently created their new Foundation in the Caymans so I will bring relevant and constructive insights as Optimism starts this journey towards a governance system that truly serves the interests of the Collective.

These are very attractive to me. The governance of many projects on the market at present is not interesting and there is no sense of participation in the knot, and only a small number of people are willing to participate in the governance. So there is a need for agents to emerge. Becoming an agent can deeply participate in the op ecology and can help the community more deeply.  **My view on the Optimistic Vision: ** Many of the so-called public chains in the market are centralized. They are not only decentralized, they also abandon the original value of Eth network. op sticks to its claim (not abandoning the value of Eth, decentralization). I agree with OP\u2019s proposition. op\u2019s governance is novel and future-proof. op introduces and concept of meta-universe governance, which will make community governance more interesting and give community members a sense of participation. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Agree with the first point. A governance model that can be used as an industry standard has not yet emerged. So we need a dynamic governance logic that can change with the tide. Strongly agree. OP Citizens and OP Holders are mutually constrained to make governance dynamic and balanced, and OP Citizens makes governance more interesting and participatory. strongly agree. The existence of Optimism Foundation is an important player in the beginning of OP governance and can make OP more compliant. As time goes by, the decentralized governance logic will become more mature, and the Optimism Foundation\u2019s authority will be decentralized at that time. That\u2019s great.

We want to play our part in helping rollups get adoption by continuing to educate users. In Optimism\u2019s governance we want to be the voice of end-users. My view on the Optimistic Vision: We are strong believers in the  Optimistic Vision. Too many open-source contributors are not getting meaningful compensation while short-term profit seekers in Web3 are getting rich. Optimism\u2019s vision of funding public goods seems like the best way to re-align incentives and makes for a future narrative filled with hope and positivity. Moreover, Cryptotesters guild is optimism-native with its membership NFT launching in 2 weeks on Optimism mainnet.

I am a technical person not afraid to dive deep into tech. Bringing transparency and ensuring well being of rollup users was always a top priority for me. I hope that by becoming a delegate I can help to steer the development of Optimism in the right direction and fulfill these goals. My view on the Optimistic Vision : Public Goods are essential for any thriving community (virtual or not). A systemic solution to the public goods funding problem will make Optimism the best rollup to use. The previous year, I had a pleasure to participate in the first Retroactive Public Goods Founding round done by Optimism. This gave me an opportunity to help many critical tools that lack any business model. I believe that baking public goods funding as a core principle of a rollup will be a game-changer for the quality of the whole ecosystem. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  As a MakerDAO governance participant I know firsthand that it\u2019s impossible to design a perfect system on the first try. We will have to experiment and iterate for years before we get the governance model right. Typical token governance with the airdrops model is broken (for everyone except yield farmers).

We fundamentally believe that blockchain technology will shape our future financial and governance structures, and as such it\u2019s crucial that those building these systems are representative of the global, diverse population which they intend to serve. As users (old and new) are priced out of Ethereum Layer 1, we urgently support Optimism\u2019s mission to scale Ethereum sustainably and are firm supporters in the creation of a virtuous cycle of public goods funding to benefit users both financially and through user experience of the cyberspace. We support the Collective\u2019s axiom of impact=profit and the principle that positive externalities should be rewarded with profit to the individual. We intent to use our delegation to ensure the individuals rewarded make up the global, diverse population that exists today and welcome them to the cyberspace through the work achieved by the Optimism Collective. We know, based on numerous studies, that diversity within organizations boosts innovation and acts as a driver for increased profitability.  So, by encouraging more diverse participation in Optimism by delegating to she256, Optimism is structurally cementing an environment ripe to produce more innovative products and superior financial returns. We believe we can be neutral governance participants who will represent the values and interests of our allies and underrepresented folks in crypto, as well as the Optimism Collective itself. By delegating to us, you\u2019ll be an ally to our cause. Thank you! My view on the Optimistic Vision: We support the Collective\u2019s axiom of impact=profit and the principle that positive externalities should be rewarded with profit to the individual. We want to align this to our vision by using our delegation to ensure the individuals rewarded make up the global, diverse population that exists today and welcome them to the cyberspace through the work achieved by the Optimism Collective. We support the funding of public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. Lack of public goods funding in the physical world often perpetuates inequalities, especially for underrepresented members of society. We align wholeheartedly with the statement that public goods can in fact be profitable, because democratizing access to resources has ripple effects in reducing inequality and as a result, generating profit. We aim to represent our communities of allies and underrepresented folks of crypto and believe we can assist the Collective in this goal. We would welcome the opportunity to contribute and play a directional role in building a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion which benefits all users of the ecosystem (both existing and potential) both financially and via user experience which aligns closely she256\u2019s core mission. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: As we fundamentally believe in blockchain technology shaping our future governance structures, we support the Working Constitution\u2019s commitment to experimentation and flexibility and would welcome the opportunity to play an active role in building the playbook for fair, democratic decentralized governance. Impossible to master on the first try, governance requires commitment to rapid experimentation / adaptation ensures a healthy system where incentives remain aligned. We support the Optimism\u2019s model to move away from simple token-based governance systems which tend towards consolidated power amongst the wealthy \u201cwhales\u201d of our ecosystem. This experiment to build a voting system representative of a large diverse community, regardless of token balance, aligns closely with she256\u2019s core mission. As the Optimism Collective continues to experiment with governance structures, we welcome the opportunity to help hold the Collective accountable in avoiding excessive consolidation of power and aligning incentives for all members of our society as this is a key component of our voting philosophy. We believe in progressive decentralization and welcome the Optimism Foundation as early leaders in the Optimism Collective\u2019s governance model. We request the transparency in actions and decision-making of the Foundation and look forward to the guidance and unique insight that the Foundation can provide. Zooming out, we believe the ability to clearly and concisely communicate information, as done in the Working Constitution itself, is a healthy indication of well-organized and sustainable governance.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Blockchain@Columbia is Columbia University\u2019s premier non-profit blockchain organization focusing on educating and empowering crypto builders, researchers, and creators. We launched the first student group DAO, Lion DAO, in 2021. Some DAO activities include a grants program which encourages Web-3 research. Our annual conference, Ledgerfest, focused on crypto and web3 founders from Arbitrum, Polygon, Cosmos, Drift, Audius, and more! We host weekly speakers like Aave\u2019s Founder Stani, Nansen\u2019s Founder Alex, Optimism\u2019s own Kelvin Fichter and we host weekly technical blockchain and development workshops. This spring we organized a 3-day hackathon, Lionhack for students and other builders in the space to help onboard more people to crypto and incubate new projects in the space. We are strong supporters of innovative Defi projects, and we are big believers in what the future of OP Governance and the Optimism collective might become. Given our experience in our own DAO\u2019s governance as well as in Uniswap, Compound, and dYdX, we believe that we are strongly equipped to act as a neutral and effective governance delegate for Optimistic Governance! My view on the Optimistic Vision: We all know that one of the founding principals of Web-3 is proof-of-work, and proving yourself through impact and results have been a core principal of crypto communities since Bitcoin\u2019s beginnings. But we believe the Optimistic collective is taking the proof of work idea to the next level with digital democratic governance. We believe in a world where incentives align and digital citizens can be rewarded contributing to the public good. We also believe in the continuous struggle toward self improvement, something the Optimism Collective has highlighted as a goal in its Vision. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   We believe in the search for continuous improvement. The optimistic collective and vision will evolve over time and the world will look different in four years.   We\u2019re excited about the experimentation between $OP governance and OP citizenship.   We believe fewer and fewer foundation intervention is better for the Optimism Collective in the long run.

For us, blockchain governance and DAOs are the perfect infrastructure for the diverse communities that will be formed this century. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to support that diversity. We\u2019ve added support for different voting systems (quadratic, weighted, ranked-choice,\u2026), strategies that allow DAOs to attribute voting power to NFTs, POAPs, ERC-1155, or any kind of tokens. A well-designed DAO thrives when its community thrives and vice-versa. We want to participate in this experiment and help design an infrastructure that rewards public goods because we know from first-hand experience how tough it is to build them. My view on the Optimistic Vision: We\u2019d like to discuss here three key ideas found in the interpretation section of the Working Constitution, as these guiding principles are key to the Optimistic Vision. First, we fully agree with the necessity of minimizing governance. I think a better framework to use here is to clearly define the tasks and decisions pertinent to each level of the Optimism governance structure. Avoiding governance fatigue means only bringing the most important decisions to the community. For this reason, we fully support the delegate system. Second, fixing the current plutocratic state of governance is trickier than it seems. There is a clear gap between the current dominant idea that token voting sucks and the reality of blockchain governance where an immense majority of projects still use token voting. Achieving a balance between financial stake and humanhood is a complex issue, but we strongly believe that the Optimism Collective has one of the best chances at solving this issue - which is why we\u2019re applying to be delegates. Finally, we strongly believe in the necessity of funding public goods. For the first year of its existence, Snapshot survived from donations - Gitcoin, and a few generous projects such as Balancer or Curve. If it wasn\u2019t for their generosity, Snapshot wouldn\u2019t exist today. During that time, most of the biggest web3 projects were already using it. We are 100% committed to helping new public good projects grow and serve the ecosystem, and we strongly believe we\u2019ll benefit significantly from that cultural shift. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Adding to what\u2019s written in the first article, it\u2019s necessary to innovate in terms of blockchain governance. The clock is ticking in terms of planet-wide coordination problems and the insights we can gain here have the power to change that. We have a moral duty to be pioneers of a system where looking out for one another is rewarded, and doesn\u2019t come at an economic cost. In the second article, I\u2019d like to add that conflict is the default state of any democracy. Conflict is good, it\u2019s a sign that dialog is possible and encouraged. It should be fostered, and key to the economic and ethical health of the governance structure. Finally, the third article is a necessary measure and we believe that, as the first article states, this is something we\u2019ll be able to discuss more in-depth once the Optimism Collective has found its footing and is ready to decentralize these responsibilities.

Alliance DAO is a community of builders that is focused on supporting Web3 founders individually and collectively succeed. Alliance believes that Optimism is building a foundation for Web3 projects that need the functionality of EVM without the gas intensity. Among many reasons for wanting to participate in Optimism\u2019s governance, three reasons motivate me to apply: (1) Optimism is building core infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem; (2) Optimism will be increasingly important for Alliance founders; and (3) Optimism will play an important role in helping DAOs govern increasingly large pools of capital. I believe that by directing capital to support public goods in the Optimism and Ethereum communities will generate significant value to these three causes. We believe Optimism will provide long-term value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism\u2019s focus on EVM equivalence and minimalism enable projects to access the core functions of Ethereum with high fidelity and low friction while reducing the gas intensity of operating directly on mainnet. The coming release of Bedrock represents the culmination of years of experience and trial-and-error that we believe will give developers even greater confidence to build on Optimism. Secure, battle-tested L2s are a gateway through which Web3 innovations will thrive. Optimism is a scaling solution for a number of projects that have graduated from our accelerator, including Synthetix and Perpetual Protocol. We believe Optimism will be an L2 of choice for many future cohort participants, given the demand for EVM equivalence and the ease of integration via Optimism. I aim to represent the views of our founders and cohort companies who have a vested interest in Optimism\u2019s reliability and improvement. I believe we are approaching a point where L2 solutions will be critical to DAO function, specifically. As we see more experimentation with governance, we need an EVM equivalent L2 that reduces the transaction cost of governance. Delegated hierarchies, subdaos, and pods present exciting opportunities to augment governance systems, but the pace and quality of experimentation will be suboptimal unless DAOs build governance on L2, thereby minimizing gas costs. Optimism is a prime candidate for enabling better governance for DAOs. By participating in the governance of the Optimism Collective, I aim to be a steward of the mission to direct funding to public goods that benefit builders in the Ethereum and Optimism communities in furtherance of the three purposes I listed. My view on the Optimistic Vision : We believe that incentives drive outcomes. Web3 projects have created more tangible incentives for actions and relationships that were previously difficult to quantify. Optimism\u2019s view that impact=profit is an extension of our view that well-engineered, traceable incentives create optimal value for collective activities. Ownership and rewards are the most reliable way to attract talented builders to address problems that affect the collective. While there are noble examples of altruists who create public goods, altruism is not reliably abundant, and it is most often an individual trait rather than a trait of teams. Web3 building requires focused teams, and ownership and rewards offer predictable incentives that can guide teams to increase the common good. Optimism\u2019s vision touches on a matter of necessity. Web3 needs communities that strive to create incentives to build public goods. There are many Web3 participants who seek to extract rents and game systems for profit to the detriment of the community. Optimism\u2019s vision is a rallying point for capable builders to push against short-termism, thereby ensuring that over the long run, value will compound for the entire community. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article 1: At Alliance, we emphasize that the greatest systems start simple. To create a rigid model of governance without the benefit of incremental feedback on specific governing rules is to govern in a vacuum. In my constant review of DAO governance systems, I see that the most successful communities adopt minimal procedural principles and adopt specific rules as specific needs arise. I often speak with Alliance cohort companies of the importance of experimentation in improving governance throughout Web3. The results of the experiments need to be intelligible in order to provide appropriate feedback. If the results of governance experiments are documented and made broadly available, the record of the experiments are, themselves, public goods. Optimism and other DAOs can study each others\u2019 governance trials to consider how prospective rules could affect their own communities. As we learn more about how rules function with specific communities, we need to permit those communities to adapt to their reality and adopt the rules that best suit them. For that reason, it is important that the Constitution is focused on flexibility. We should only adopt enough order to initiate a worthwhile experiment, while limiting the potential downsides of path dependence. By virtue of the commitment to experimentation, it follows that the Constitution should be transitory at inception. We may discover sound methods of governing that are unimaginable to us at the moment, which would make dogmatic reference to the original document unproductive. An example of governance innovations that had no application in the recent past is Optimism\u2019s adoption of soulbound tokens for the Citizens House. We may discover incredible utility from using soulbound tokens that, had a governing document conflicted with the adoption of those tokens, would have stunted the development of the governance system. The goal of creating a Bedrock Constitution is helpful: at some point governance history may require documentation of foundational rules. The Bedrock Constitution should incorporate the principle of flexibility and the capacity for amendment in order to sustain the spirit of innovation. Article 2 : Basic token-weighted governance has not proven to work for collectives. I have studied DAOs that are purportedly flat in structure and repeatedly these DAOs show gulf in participation between a small number of repeat-participants and the mass of inactive participants. Without balance of power, a few actors grab power, which alienates most would-be contributors. Optimism\u2019s bicameral structure is a compelling way to balance short term needs with long term, stable decision making. Variants of the bicameral model worked for Rome (Senate / Tribunes), Sparta (ephors / gerousia) and for many constitutional structures in modern government. It is too early to assess whether the specific reserved powers for the Citizens\u2019 House and Token House will provide sufficient controls. Experimentation will provide feedback that will help inform which powers should be reserved to which house. Article 3: I am very familiar with Cayman Foundation Companies, as I have researched the option for Alliance DAO and for other DAOs. I believe that structures like the Cayman Foundation, which permit significant flexibility in organizational design, are a stepping stone, but not an end state, in building successful DAOs. If the Optimism Foundation faithfully administers the vision of progressive decentralization, it will have fulfilled a critical function for the Optimism ecosystem. As drafted (presumably in the Memorandum of Association), the Board\u2019s powers present an additional dimension of separation of powers. The Foundation can have a stabilizing effect if the initial allocation of powers between the Citizens\u2019 House and Token House is not perfectly balanced. Over time, it should be made clear what powers the Citizens\u2019 House and Token House have relative to the Foundation and whether the Foundation will have the ultimate goal of sharing the power to amend the Constitution or ceding the power altogether.

I left the practice of law to become an investment banker, then an investor, on my way to becoming an entrepreneur. Through my path, I gained a wide variety of organizational experience. Now, I focus my time both on DAO design and helping Web3 founders think through complex issues in tackling their product roadmaps at Alliance. I speak to founders of DAOs, protocols, and Web3 tools on a daily basis about the problems they face and I act as a thought partner to work with them to find long term solutions. I have been an active participant in public policy and governance policy discussions. I testified to the Wyoming state legislature regarding amendments to their DAO LLC statute; I participate in DeFi Education Fund projects; I am part of the World Economic Forum DAO Working Group; and I participate regularly in conference panels on DAOs.

To realise the Optimistic Vision, there must be effective collaboration between OP governance and the projects that call Optimism home.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: The longer I spend in crypto, the more I realise it\u2019s all about coordination. The Optimistic Vision is a bold attempt to redefine the way we coordinate that leverages the innate strengths of the internet. One of the biggest advantages of internet software is that it can be freely replicated, making it a perfect public good. However, without a business model, we have been forced to undermine this strength with paywalls and a closed source mindset. If retroactive public goods funding is successful, free and open-source software will be able to take centre stage as we build the next generation of the internet. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  We\u2019ve embraced iterative governance at Lyra and are strong believers in it. The important thing is to codify how the governance process itself can change (i.e. meta-governance) early on so that changes can be transparent and democratic. It\u2019s imperative that we as a community move beyond coin voting, which suffers from being inherently plutocratic. I believe the Optimism Foundation is a necessary evil at this stage.

It seems obvious that (a) trustless computation and (b) a public, trustless, immutable database are revolutionary primitives that will unlock amazing things we haven\u2019t seen before. And yet, I\u2019m generally skeptical of most web3 so far, because the vast majority are self-referential; most excitement for crypto products is predicated on the appreciation of crypto itself, rather on something that people value independently from crypto. I\u2019ve been following this space for 8 years, and I\u2019ve yet to see an application that isn\u2019t deeply \u201cmeta\u201d. As cool as many of those are, what I really want to see is web3-style solutions tackling existing problems we have in the world. I think this is possible, but I just haven\u2019t seen much of it yet. So with all that, my interest in participating in Optimism is that I\u2019d like to do my part to shepherd the community towards more of those concrete applications that will change the way people live and relate to each other. I\u2019m optimistic we can make it happen.  My view on the Optimistic Vision: It\u2019s incredibly exciting to find a community that values public goods as much as I do, and understands that coordination problems are central to almost every major problem that humans have struggled most to solve. I\u2019m curious to see what concrete steps the Optimism community takes to actual solve these sorts of problems. It\u2019s easy to point out that coordination problems are the source of many of our troubles, and it\u2019s a different thing entirely to actually execute on novel solutions to solve those problems. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I\u2019m excited to be part of the evolution of this governance system, and that it\u2019s intentionally designed to be flexible, responsive, and iterative. In the same spirit, if I\u2019m elected as a delegate, I plan to start with a self-imposed term limit of 3 months. After that, I\u2019ll reflect on whether I feel like I\u2019m making a meaningful contribution to the ecosystem and decide whether I should continue being a delegate.

Additionally, I\u2019ve contributed to Public Goods personally with my time and talents at ETHGlobal, which was a fortunate recipient in Optimism\u2019s first retroactive grants round and have a first-hand understanding of operating a Public Good. I\u2019m thrilled to see that Optimism embraces both Ethereum and Public Goods with open arms and is building out its Optimistic vision around these topics. As both topics are the focus of my time and energy, I\u2019d be honoured to participate in this process as a delegate. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I love the axiom of impact=profit and have seen ETHGlobal grow from a small team running a couple of events to dozens of yearly events and a team of nearly 15. There\u2019s an incredible positive feedback cycle I\u2019ve observed between either side of the equality\u2014impact increases profit, and profit can be reinvested to produce additional impact. It\u2019s very easy to be (and remain) pessimistic about the future but optimism is the currency of progress. I believe the vision laid out by Optimism will play a part in creating a better future for humanity. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  In the USA over the last month or so, regardless of position on the issue, we\u2019ve seen the instability that can be caused by an immutable constitution. Web3 + Ethereum is still in its infancy and it seems only natural to me that we should adopt a commitment to flexibility and experimentation. I look forward to building a more long-term constitution from the learnings over a long period. I\u2019m excited to see how this model will play out and adapt over time. Checks and balances are fundamental to ensure a calibrated system. I think the Optimism Foundation should look to the Ethereum Foundation as an example of how to be a great steward like this. I believe it\u2019s necessary for any community to start with an initial strong vision and leadership, as the Collective will grow, naturally, leaders in specific topics of the ecosystem will emerge, leading to a more decentralized, constantly growing, Collective.

We\u2019re a decentralised derivates exchange and one of the leading protocols that currently operates on Optimism. We\u2019re a big believer in composability and have been actively bringing partner projects over to deploy on OP. Having committed to making OP our home, we\u2019d love to be an $OP delegate to help shape the future of Optimism. My view on the Optimistic Vision: Completely agree that we need to create a space that is owned by its citizens rather than a select few. The focus on composability excites us on the future of the space and it\u2019s something we can\u2019t wait to see play out My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   This is a working constitution : Agree. This is a very similar approach that we take at Perp as we believe in the need to continually learn and improve.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : Agree on this view. It\u2019s extremely important that we place emphasis on the balance - too often projects skew either side.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model : We understand that there needs to be some entity to start with to help facilitate governance and push things forward. Given there isn\u2019t a strong blueprint for the best way to decentralise (without trading off speed of execution) the plan to gradually decentralise makes the most sense  My Web3 interests : Defi, DAOs, Governance Languages I speak and write : I speak English however there are members of the team that speak Chinese as well My favorite Web3 projects : Big fan of Ribbon and Frax ",

StableNode also provides a full suite of services around governance with both implementation and active participation as a delegate. The Governance Lab of the StableNode team is on a mission to provide decentralized governance best practices to ecosystems. There is no one-size-fits-all solution but a framework of principles and tools that articulate alternative paths based on each ecosystem\u2019s maturity level. Our primary focus is working with the community to develop this framework and continue to facilitate innovation within this domain. Our view on the Optimistic Vision: At StableNode, we believe that public funding is essential to developing a non-financial-driven web3. We believe that the focus should be on encouraging developers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods where a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to the space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for developers. Initially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current financial and political standards that we have. The Optimistic vision details a necessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable and will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing the financial gain they would gain elsewhere. Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution.  Currently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing to see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation throughout the next few years. Decentralized governance is relatively a new field within Web3. It is an important topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems such as voting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy need to be tackled. We believe that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance methods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a protocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you so far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes experimentation.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.  This experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives through token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and allow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term improvement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive public funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner. Those individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this means reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house who have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward and see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.  We favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the framework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders and delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is most likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the structure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it would be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities to the DAO. Our Web3 interests: DAOs, Data and analytics, DeFi, Governance, Social impact As a team, we speak the following languages: en, ko, da, de, es, zh Our skills and areas of expertise: Governance and Growth We are currently delegates at Element Finance, InstadApp, MakerDAO, and others. What voters can expect from StableNode: We will use our expertise to import the most promising practices within governance to guide Optimism governance to a more sustainable approach. We want to help facilitate discussions where we can identify the best practices and recognize how to tackle core problems within governance such as plutocracy, voter apathy, and lack of experimentation. As delegates, we pursue:  Active participation in votes Transparency for each vote Open discussion and contribution to the DAO forum Contribute to the innovation and development of governance frameworks  Conflicts of Interest StableNode acts as delegates on other protocols. All of our governance participation is public. ",

If you want to have a non-default image, go update your ENS avatar. Instructions to do so are here.   We\u2019ve updated the list of \u201cinterests\u201d with a few new options due to popular demand. You are welcome to revisit the list and update the interests you included in your sign-up response!   This post marks the cutoff for delegate signups that will appear on the Optimism website when OP is available to claim. Delegate signups will always remain open, and tokenholders will be able to delegate or re-delegate their voting power to any valid address at any time. The signup process outlined on this thread is designed to make it easy for people claiming OP in Airdrop #1 to select a delegate who can represent their interests. Signups posted after this message will not be shown as part of the claim website, although they are still valid delegate signups. If you missed this cutoff, don\u2019t worry \u2014 this is only the first airdrop, and we expect delegation and Token House governance to go through many iterations.

The SNX Ambassadors play the role of governance participation on behalf of our community for many protocols and Optimism governance would be yet another key place for us to be active in. My view on the [Optimistic Vision ]:  The OP collective will be a new path for governance in Cyberspace, and the physical world. Ownership and rewards are the most reliable way to attract the best builders to address problems that affect the collective Web3 needs groups that want to create incentives to build public goods; OP vision is a rallying point for builders to push against short termism. This will ensure value will compound for the long run.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  This is a \u201cworking\u201d constitution:   We live in constant change, and this transitory document needs to reflect our human behavior/lifestyle to be fluid until we create our \u201cbedrock\u201d framework. Innovation is needed for blockchain governance   OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective:   Short-term incentives and long term visions must be aligned; we are excited about the experimentation between OP Governance and OP citizenship. Variants of the bicameral model worked for Sparta, and has alot of potential on what OP is proposing   The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model:   We believe in progressive decentralization and welcome the OP Foundation as early leaders in the OP Collectives governance model.  My Web3 interests: DAOs, Governance, Legal, Economics Languages I speak and write: English My skills and areas of expertise: The Synthetix Ambassador Council is comprised of three members who are signers on the snxambassador.eth multi-sig and we oversee governance for many ecosystem protocols. We are currently active Delegates for several DeFi projects and have experience in submitting and deploying governance proposals and staying up to date on broader governance matters. We also have access to resources with in the Synthetix DAO for purposes of protocol integrations. Our current signers, who\u2019s twitter handles can be found on @snxambassadors profile bio, are made up of a combination of SNX Core Contributors and long time active Community members who are well versed in the operation of Synthetix and other DeFi/NFT projects. We have a diverse set of skills that include Protocol/Governance analysis, user acquisition strategies, varying degrees of DeFi integrations, general marketing/communication skills and a wide range of other abilities in web3 and DeFi alike. My favorite Web3 projects: Ethereum, Optimism, Synthetix ",

In addition to building the marketplace, we spend lots of time building community and advising projects in the Optimism NFT space. NFTs have a small marketshare compared to defi, but a large mindshare. We believe NFTs will be crucial to defining the culture of Optimism and for any governance proposal someone should be asking: \u201chow does this affect NFTs and non-financial dapps?\u201d We plan to advocate for the interest of NFT projects and non-financial dapps during the governance process. My view on the Optimistic Vision: In the words of Vitalik, \u201ceven a billion dollars of capital cannot compete with a project having a soul.\u201d The Optimistic Vision is the soul of Optimism, which is to say it\u2019s the most important part of this project. If we succeed in moving the majority of layer 1 Ethereum activity to layer 2s like Optimism, the vision and values of the protocol will be enormously important. We\u2019re strongly committed to creating a world of regenerative finance, positive externalities, and shared abundance. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  We agree that taking an iterative approach is best and that there will be more rapid iteration at earlier stages than later stages. The token house makes a lot of sense. Questions remain around the Citizen\u2019s house: How is citizenship allocated? Can someone lose citizenship? What will incentivize citizens to actually participate in governance? We feel confident that the OF will govern with a steady hand and is committed to progressive decentralization.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes, that\u2019s why we founded a specialized company. We focus on governance, ecosystem building & tools around top Web 3 projects. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: We realized the same governance issues, tribalism, short-termism, replication of tech/mistakes, intransparency over and over since joining crypto. We started blockchain-comparison.com to spread quality information and onboard people to crypto. Now, we take this one step further with scaleweb3.com, defend the most value-aligned, value-adding, essential Web 3 building blocks and help them grow. Sidenote: Personally, I see Ethereum as the center and settlement layer of Web 3 and Optimism as a fundamental building block in our envisioned Web 3 stack. The Ethereum ecosystem has quality contributors, some positive-sum, value-aligned projects such as Uniswap and Gitcoin and I would love to become a governance steward that further supports the values with best interests of projects and token/stakeholders in mind. My view on the Optimistic Vision : I see many parallels to our own ambitions when we started blockchain-comparison.com in 2018. The mentioned comparison between blockchain ecosystems and new economies is somewhat flawed but we also think it\u2019s essential in Web 3 to find key stakeholders early-on which are able to unlock network effects, a sustainable growth of the ecosystem - based on real economic growth - with aligned values (!). Besides that, I was positively surprised to see \u201cimpact = profit\u201d as almost all social/public goods should at least be sustainable and I am all in into proving that public goods can capture margins and be positive sum for all value-adding OR benefitting, consuming stakeholders. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: The title is spot-on. You don\u2019t build a complex system from scratch, you rather go there iteratively. I believe in progressive decentralization, think it\u2019s absolutely fair for a core team to take the majority of key decisions early-on but I will definitely work towards a future with core protocols which are hardened, secure, trust-minimized, governance-minimized, yet community-owned.

Our reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Flipside\u2019s mission is to help blockchains succeed. We want to become Optimism delegates, because we believe Layer 2s, and specifically Optimism, are a core piece to scaling the new digital economy on top of Ethereum. Flipside Governance participates in more than a dozen protocols across Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Flow, and a number of Cosmos SDK chains. We work closely with Aave, SushiSwap, Marinade, and MakerDAO - and have on-chain proof of participation. We aim to bring our expertise and one of the few full-time Governance teams in the industry to help Optimism strengthen its governance and voting processes. As a delegate, Optimism gains full access to our time and resources, a team of 70+ with robust data science & infrastructure capabilities, and our community of 12,000+ data analysts. On top of that, we will contribute hands-on expertise in voting, writing, and passing proposals. We are active community members in protocols that we engage with - you can find us actively participating on governance forums, Discord, and Twitter. Our view on the Optimistic Vision 42: Through our analytical bounty and scavenger programs, Flipside Crypto embodies the axiom impact=profit. Flipside Community members take the time and initiative to build out dashboards and analytics, providing unique insights for a range of protocols & DAOs. Flipside believes that public goods inform and empower the average crypto user better than closed source alternatives. Optimism is pioneering this vision and advocating for profitability at the same time. We want to help Optimism follow through on its vision and improve Web3 accountability, one build at a time. Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article 1: Every DAO experiences different Growth trajectories. As partners of DAOs in different stages of maturity and TVL, we believe it is important to allow for flexibility while building with speed. Enough structure to support, as much freedom as possible, is our guiding principle. Article 2: While token holders are entitled to certain rights, they are not what makes up a DAO by themselves - Governance comes in many forms and is in need of innovation. Optimism must find a balance between value creation and encouraging participation among community members. We acknowledge multiple assets exist to make up a DAO and are excited by the experimental use of emerging new mechanisms, like \u201csoulbound\u201d NFTs. Article 3: As Compound has shown, and as we have seen in our work with MakerDAO, there is a way for organizations to become more decentralized over time. We believe that having the Optimism Foundation as a steward in the early stages of development is instrumental, as the Foundation can provide the insight and knowledge necessary for building a strong product that can then enable successful decentralization. Our Web3 interests: Data Analytics, Bounty & Grants Programs, Layer 1s & Layer 2s, Governance, and DAOs (see MetricsDAO) Languages we speak and write: Our core governance team is composed of members who are fluent in English, German, and Mandarin. Our skills and areas of expertise: Flipside is a Web3 company with experience in building tools, communities, and recently DAOs. We partner with major networks & protocols to drive data analytics and user acquisition. Flipside Governance, a department of Flipside Crypto, was established in September 2021, to directly support and contribute to DAO governance, and increase participation in our partner communities - thereby helping to improve the efficiency of this critical piece of protocol health. We are committed to using this team and experience to improve DAOs one proposal at a time. Flipside Governance is one of the few full-time governance teams in the industry. We have developed a deep understanding of the needs and of the flow of information in governance processes as well as key tooling necessary to be successful. Our members currently sit on a range of committees and boards: Review Committee at Aave Grants DAO, Transferability Committee at Paladin, and DeFi Committee at MonkeDAO. ",

Since then i have been fully employed and engaged in the space, this is my job. My view on the Optimistic Vision : Our foundation here at Optimism is strong and our vision strongly aligns with the major principals and beliefs that most Ethereum maximalists adhere to, I think optimisms culture is comparable to Gitcoin and in the end that will benefit the protocol. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution   Starting out governance is always a slow and painful process so i completely agree with the approach as naturally things start to smooth out with time. however i would like to see a way to amend such a Constitutional law if it is somehow detrimental to the protocol no matter the timeframe. keep in mind this would need to be extremely thought out.   Clearly checks and balances are needed, people voice also should always matter so a include all approach is great considering our users not only know what we need but also drive the ship, i strongly agree.   I trust the Optimism Foundation to nurture the protocol until it can care for itself, it would be foolish to say otherwise.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Llama builds economic infrastructure for DAOs. We have worked with some of the leading DAOs on on-chain governance and treasury allocations, including Aave, Uniswap, dYdX, Gitcoin, Radicle, PoolTogether, FWB, Harvest Finance, and Fei Protocol, among others. We would like to be a delegate for Optimism because we are excited about Optimism\u2019s potential to expand crypto to a wide range of builders and users. As one of the most active participants in protocol governance, we hope to bring a similar level of rigor and expertise to the Optimism ecosystem as we have with other protocols. My view on the Optimistic Vision 44: We think DAOs are a defining coordination mechanism and Optimism\u2019s focus on funding public goods is critical. Over time, governance will become increasingly important to ensure that the Optimism Collective can grow and sustain the network. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: The Optimism network and DAO is in too early of a stage to be rigid about specific rules. A spirit of experimentation encapsulated in the working constitution is important to ensure that the network evolves with the evolving demands of the crypto and broader internet ecosystem. The working constitution will not stay in effect for longer than four years. Progressive decentralization from the foundation to the community makes sense as long as the foundation is fairly transparent and responsive to the changing needs of the community.

Collaboration between top protocols (eg. Maker, Curve, Aave, Uniswap, etc) and the Optimism collective can help kickstart the liquidity necessary to support broad migration of activity from L1 to L2. I am a consistent voter within several projects and will be able to incorporate OP delegate responsibilities into my existing workflow. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I think the vision is very ambitious (difficult to achieve) but also exciting and optimistic. Achieving these goals will require strong cultural alignment, community building, and governance oversight. I think building up liquidity and app utility on Optimism is the most important short term objective to fulfill the Optimistic vision. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   Working constitution - I think it\u2019s good to acknowledge that more experience is needed before ossifying Optimism\u2019s governance framework. I particularly like the 4 year sunset clause, which should serve as a forcing function to adopt a long term constitution (similar to Ethereum\u2019s difficulty bombs)  OP citizens and OP holders are equal - I think the bicameral model (tokens + citizens) makes sense while Optimism is in early stages of development. But I think it will be very important to hold citizen governance to a high standard to avoid incentive misalignment (as the citizens have no direct cryptoeconomic stakes like OP holders). I\u2019m still on the fence if this sort of \u201csoulbound\u201d governance is feasible in the long run but look forward to gaining more empirical evidence through Optimism governance.  Optimism Foundation - As long as token holders have effective oversight/veto powers, off chain foundations can be a valuable asset for decentralized orgs. Over time I think the foundation should shift from a stewardship role to being a bridge between the collective and real world agreements/legal matters.

From complete beginners to Web3 natives, the most significant pain point that users bring up is the Ethereum gas fees. Instead of explaining why they should pick to pay more on Ethereum vs a less-secure alt L1 chain, rollups let us abstract away those conversations\u2014 giving users the best of both worlds without the jargon. Being one of the first movers in the Ethereum scaling space, I think Optimism, among others, has tremendous potential to serve the next cohort of Ethereum users. Public goods: I want to help the facilitation and growth of public goods, both within Ethereum and beyond. I am an active contributor to GitcoinDAO and would like to expand my public goods contributions to being more involved in the governance processes that prop them up. Disappointment: Sadly, the current token governance systems are somewhat broken. The same people become stewards in every hot DAO, often with good intentions but with poor results and outcomes. Mostly unaccountable to their delegates, some voting based on whims instead of research. Even worse, looking through the delegate commitments here, I see what I view as many half-baked or rushed answers. I don\u2019t expect or want to become a whale delegate (ideally, we shouldn\u2019t even have them)\u2014having a large pool of representatives with small delegations is healthier, will give better representation, and be more sustainable. So if you\u2019re reading this and thinking of becoming a delegate\u2014dao it ! My view on the Optimistic Vision The Optimistic Collective\u2019s North Star resonates with me strongly. Too many smart people are working on bullshit projects because building something impactful traditionally hasn\u2019t paid the bills. The Optimism Collective is positioned to shift this dynamic from within the Ethereum ecosystem and then beyond. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution 1) Well put. It\u2019s foolish to pretend we have everything figured out. Admitting that this will require iteration and experimentation is highly mature. 2) The current token governance structures are clearly failing (governance purely by popularity contest, consolidation of power to the new \u2018web3 elites\u2019, quorums being lowered due to waning interest). The governance experiments that The Optimism Collective will run really excite me. I hope we can discover better ways to govern decentralized collectives. 3) The initial involvement of The Optimism Foundation and having progressive decentralization as a mechanism to ensure the long-term success of The Optimism Collective seems pragmatic.

My view on the first three articles of the : I think the bicameral design is necessary for identity.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Absolutely\u2026 I am here to represent the creative souls in the space, visionary leaders! My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Besides our NFT project Ganland taking over the ranks on the Optimism Layer 2 Quixotic marketplace, I have been operating an artist owned business with my partner who is also an artist, and we help to raise money for other artists in the community who are teachers of traditional painting techniques. The artists we support in Peru are less fortunate and do not have immediate access to blockchain technology in the remote jungles. Our goal is to not only help cultivate a way for the artists to expose their art to the world, but also to break down the digital divide. We have built a foundation through our altruistic fair distribution royalties by manufacturing physical fine art prints for other artists. Fractal Visions is bridging the gap between the 2D & 3D NFT art world. Web 3 has led us to believe that we can help other artists by introducing them to the crypto space safely over time. Quality is what matters most and the message behind the mission you are set out to accomplish! We are pioneering our way into the future one creation at a time. My view on the Optimistic Vision: We are for the people !!! Our life consists of a very sacrificial process where helping others come first. There is a big shift happening in the world and as visionaries it is our duty to be present & active within the community. I have always been a big quadratic funding enthusiast and love blockchain technology for the good of humanity with public funding. Our business aligns with these same long term goals and dedication to build a better world. Together we can make a huge difference ! My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I think it\u2019s a very interesting structure for an ongoing governance deployment system to be released over the course of multiple years, and I believe this will be a prime example for other systems of real world governance to build on top of.

Additionally, I\u2019ve contributed to Public Goods personally with my time and talents at ETHGlobal, which was a fortunate recipient in Optimism\u2019s first retroactive grants round 1 and have a first-hand understanding of operating a Public Good. I\u2019m thrilled to see that Optimism embraces both Ethereum and Public Goods with open arms and is building out its Optimistic vision around these topics. As both topics are the focus of my time and energy, I\u2019d be honoured to participate in this process as a delegate. My view on the Optimistic Vision : We all know that one of the founding principals of Web-3 is proof-of-work, and proving yourself through impact and results have been a core principal of crypto communities since Bitcoin\u2019s beginnings. But we believe the Optimistic collective is taking the proof of work idea to the next level with digital democratic governance. We believe in a world where incentives align and digital citizens can be rewarded contributing to the public good. We also believe in the continuous struggle toward self improvement, something the Optimism Collective has highlighted as a goal in its Vision. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1- We believe in the search for continuous improvement. The optimistic collective and vision will evolve over time and the world will look different in four years. 2- We\u2019re excited about the experimentation between $OP governance and OP citizenship. 3- We believe fewer and fewer foundation intervention is better for the Optimism Collective in the long run.

Currently, an on-chain gaming builder DAO I organized is deploying our governance voting contract on OP, implementing an experiment where all contribution actions are quantified as voting weights. I would love to participate in the governance of the whole ecosystem at the same time to move forward together. My view on the Optimistic Vision 64: Although Web3 is more friendly to public goods, language barriers and some inherent biases have kept many non-native English-speaking public goods builders being ignored. I\u2019ve been working with my partners on this since 2018, writing many articles and making appeals on social media for people to pay more attention to Web3 open source developers in non-native English speaking regions, especially in countries where the laws are not Web3 friendly. Some Web3 contributors are considered as illegals in their home countries. Many of them have to leave their country and become digital nomads to continue their Web3 careers. I hope that Optimism can help. And this is why I come here. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1. This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution. As Mao Zedong said, the future is bright, the road is winding. If we agree that Web3 is a new revolution, we should be willing to experiment with it. 2. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective. I think the bicameral governance system will work, but the process will definitely not be smooth. People\u2019s contributions to a Web ecosystem are diverse, and we should respect this diversity and develop governance solutions that are consistent with it. I found that Velodrome Finance uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance: a ERC-20 unility token called $VELO and a ERC-721 governance token called $veVELO. But this is still too simple. As I see,  the non-transferable ERC1155 might be a better option, you can use this to quantify each kind of contribution and assign voting weights to it. At the same time, you can also airdrop the ERC-20 tokens that can be traded to its owner. For some non-permanent contribution behaviours, such as early transactions and transfers on the network, the contributions will not exist as ERC1155 and will simply be redeemed for ERC-20 tokens. This is the better option I can think of, and the governance experiment MarrowDAO is currently working on. 3. The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model. Agree. Premature decentralization means the decentralisation of responsibility, and in the early stages we need an organisation that upholds the spirit of decentralization to take responsibility and to better deal with the problems that come from reality.

I have explained in greater length in a blogpost On DAO governance the reasoning why I believe it is really important NOT to delegate to institutions and to have varied pool of delegates. I want to see this governance experiment flourish and avoid the future where we end up govern by few big crypto corporations, prevent the future of plutocracy and help establish healthy norms of decentralized governance. We have not seen many governance attacks on protocols but they are coming, since the incentives are there. My view on the Optimistic Vision: One of the main things I want to become a delegate is my alignment with this vision. I am in this space to help solving issues that are not being solved atm. To systematically solve global issues like climate change, ocean & air pollution needs better mechanism. The \u201cstart from oneself\u201d idea when dealing with these issues strikes me as ineffective and possibly harmful, by providing a false sense of good \u201cI am doing my part\u201d feeling that does not really contribute to solve any of the major issues the global community faces today. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:     A commitment to experimentation I like & agree with this part.  A transitory document If a new constitution is going to be adopted after 4 years, I see this as possibly problematic. I like the current leadership & vibe and think the constitution is mainly about values that we are trying to uphold. The leadership & governance in 4 years time is unknown, thus I would like to see permanent constitution adopted rather sooner than later.    OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective Really like this two house experiment, think that 1 token 1 vote is inherently problematic governance structure for many protocols OP included, really like to see innovation on this front!!  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model. This is preferred by me, as I believe that it is important who sets the tone + direction for the protocol. The team is well known and reputable, I am of the opinion that we need good leaders with accountability that can be replaced swiftly if need be and am against having no governance, or governance by \u201cthe community\u201d especially since we are at the beginning and there is not much community to talk of yet.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: I believe that the vision is the right way to go, as it would ensure that funding will end up where it should be, ie. strengthening the greater, public good. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I agree with articles 1 and 3 - in a sense, they seem pretty obvious (decentralized governance and the foundation approach), but I guess it is necessary to spell it out to make sure we are all on the same page. Regarding article 2, I find this the most interesting at this stage. The creation of Citizens is a novel approach, but I hope it will counter the usual dumping of tokens that are only in for a quick profit. I feel that the Citizen model will solve this by aligning (read: also financial incentives) permanent members with Optimism.

I\u2019ve been expecting rollup governance tokens for a long time, I care a great deal about their success and I frequently talk about how important rollups are for true DeFi scalability. I\u2019d rather be a delegate than complain from the sidelines that Ethereum and Optimism\u2019s long-term interests are not being carefully understood and respected.

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I believe in governance minimization. Rollups have the interesting quality that the fundamental security can be inherited from the L1, and I believe that we should strive towards those goals as much as possible and not diffuse that quality by allowing aggressive and haphazard L2 governance.

I  have and Yes, I do. I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes, I welcome it! My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: If the crypto space expects to see mass-adoption in the future, then there needs to be representation for those who are less \u201ctech-savvy. \u201c Nuances of the crypto space are not always intuitive or second-nature to a lot of users. I would like an opportunity to represent those OP Citizens who traditionally, haven\u2019t been early-adopters of new technology. Thank you for taking the time to read my Delegate Comment. My view on the [Optimistic Vision 91  I agree that a \u201csymbiotic-altruism\u201d can come from the vision; impact = profit. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1: The \u201cfour year\u201d construction makes sense. It\u2019s like a \u201cBeta constitution\u201d in a safe-space where experimentation and resultant failures are all expected parts of the process. (Having said that, four years feels like a long test period). 2:&3: The bicameral system, appears to be a \u201ctricameral\u201d system with the OP Holders, OP Citizens and the OP Foundation, forming the third branch. Having a built-in tie-breaker in governance, can be positive and should be something to consider retaining, even if the OP Foundation chooses to take a less active role in the future.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: The vision is a great 1st step/take in creating a tangible framework around public goods. I think it will be crucial when it comes to impact that the system isn\u2019t gamed in a manner in which an individual is doing both positive and negative actions in relation to public goods. For example, externally having a positive impact but as an individual with lesser impact internally doing negative actions. Figuring out the weight distribution between the 2 may help truly measure impact both externally/internally to a reasonable extent without being too internally invasive. Lastly since some public goods are finite (minerals, natural resources) profitability may not be the best approach for these goods and finding a different w to frame and incentive the sustainability of them will be important. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I believe constitutions should have core tenants that form the root over time with branches growing and withering to the whims of time. I feel there\u2019s a fear with long lived tenants due to the examples of modern constitutions that have swayed away from the original intent or become murky to translate to the present. I believe with web3 this can be solved due to the immutability/transparency of blockchains along with the fact this constitution isn\u2019t being created in a closed mainly monoculture room but within. an open ecosystem. I think it will be key to identify the core aspects of optimism and how they can be governed & grow autonomously by those heavily interested within that segment. I think roles should be more ephemeral with terms similar to our current government system but be a mix of voting and merit and a cap on term limits and future roles.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: As a delegate, I wish to uphold ethical, constructive values that encourage positive growth for Ethereum and the Optimism network. My values are in direct alignment with the core values of the Ethereum foundation and Optimism collective. My view on the Optimistic Vision 97: I believe that the Optimistic Vision 97 is a forerunner to a stable and ethical moral standard for the development of public goods. It\u2019s in my belief that the Web3 industry needs positive and morally aligned individuals seeking for Ethereum to grow as strong as their project. (When built on top or alongside) Public goods do not have to suffer from a lack of funding and support\u2014 regarding research, development and sustainability. In fact, we have moral obligations as a society to reinforce and finance their operations to ensure the future citizens of our world have access to basic necessities and new technological advances. We have the ability to ensure that public goods have sustainable business models and active supporters. That way, they last good and long instead of great and short. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   I heavily believe in the first article. People need to embrace \u2018Shoshin\u2019 or the beginners mind. The ability to freely experiment toward \u2018impossible\u2019 concepts creates real innovation.   The dual governing method is very intriguing to me. I\u2019ve spent time modelling a dual governance system, and I think there is room to innovate and expand this concept.   It makes sense that the Optimism Collective will become more decentralized over time as nothing gets decentralized without a starting point. The Optimism Foundation should get welcomed from this standpoint.   My Web3 interests: a) The OG Cypherpunk ideology\u2014 cryptoanarchism.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes, I understand My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:  Governance, voting and the separation of powers have always been keen interests of mine. This is a rare moment where one can make a difference in a powerful decentralized, technological and social movement and I\u2019d love to use my skillsets to help navigate the waters ahead. I believe that Optimism has a powerful mission and a great culture surrounding their team and the wider community. My view on the Optimistic Vision : I love the use of first principles thinking to embody core values into the essence of the protocols and social layers. Utilizing free markets to enhance the value of public goods is a brilliant idea and the end goal of serving basic human needs as a built-in feature of an economy is something that I\u2019ve strived towards as an individual. I love the optimism! My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: It\u2019s refreshing to see a governance that starts from a position of humility and is relatively flexible early on. Similar to other two-token models I believe that governance also requires a \u201cmodular\u201d approach  . I also agree with a formal tried and tested governance model initially which will then better coordinate the path towards a functioning decentralised model.

My friends and I have already started creating DAOs and sent not only mainnet native tokens but atl tokens to each other to make promises and transfer value. I would like to be a delegate because I would like to be a part of what makes blockchain technology an equitable and inclusive environment where everyone can take part in its evolution for the betterment of the collective. My view on the Optimistic Vision 99: One thing that I like about the Optimistic Vision is it starts from a place of empathy, and I\u2019m interested in studying the impact=profit paradigm closely. I also believe just like in this vision document that now is the right time to start building a system that merges the physical world and the digital world because at this present moment our (i.e., humanity\u2019s) currently financial, and societal system are not equipped to handle this convergence properly. Therefore, we need to start creating systems that not only tie these worlds together, but the foundational focus should have the betterment of all people as its core. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article one, spoke about the unsustainability of a fixed model governmental system. Having a commitment to experimentation of the system is very important because to solve problems a scientific approach is necessary. Also, having a transitory document will allow us to evaluate the impacts of past actions so that better improvements and alignment to principles of the collective is possible. Article two having a fair and balance check and balancing system intent is to keep the interest of the collection in harmony with the Optimistic Vision. This system should always be is balance and coexist equally within the collective. Article three, as the collective grows the interest of the foundation should change and move toward decentralization decreasing the need for a managing board which is centralized in nature.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: I do. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: My purpose as a delegate is to act as a handbrake. After more than 7 years in the crypto industry, it is still far too rosy. I am currently working as an emerging technologies policy lawyer in a European member state ministry and also a national representative to the European Blockchain Partnership of the European Commission. My goals are long term, and my attitude is risk averse. Do not expect positive feedbacks on proposals, do not expect cheering comments. The end goal is a self-sustaining ecosystem where projects and people can grow qualitatively and quantitatively. I am your grumpy, in the end right, grandpa. The ''always stay OPtimistic\" is absolutely not my ethos. I share the ethos of Ray Dalio: \u201cIf you are not worrying, you should be worried\u201d My view on the Optimistic Vision : way too OPtimistic. Why using a hyped term like Web3 in the first sentence? What is web3 and to whoes benefit is the term Web3? However, working in politics for a long time I have learned \u2018visions\u2019 are important. They set the mark on the horizon. It functions as a magnet for people willing to build and gain knowledge and resources. I do like terms as \u2019 digital democratic governance\u2019 and profitable public goods. It almost sound political. Which makes me doubt at the same time. Who set these goals? In what way OP wants to accomplish this? At the cost of what? Within what timeframe? Many questions that need to be addressed before an ecosystem can actually be called an ecosystem My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: The articles are well-formulated. There is a train of thought behind them and the aim is cooperation and joint advocacy. The latter is very important. Almost everyone wants to be part of the ecosystem for personal gain. The question is how to use game theory so that everyone can achieve personal gain, but at the same time, the ecosystem can flourish.  What we have seen in recent years is that when things go downhill, many of the ecosystem participants disappear. This is not crazy, this is human. It is therefore important to build in the right incentives so that the ecosystem as a whole, but also the individual participant, can flourish. These articles seem like a good first step, but again there are many loose ends that need to be answered in the long run.

I align with the values of the Optimism project because scaling Ethereum is important along with fairness to the community.

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I like the approach of the 4yr bedrock with a commitment to experimentation for dynamic governance, it makes a lot of sense to start humble and adapt to the environment. It also makes a lot of sense to use a bicameral governance system and avoid the concentration of power. this is super important in crypto when community is involved.

As an advocate for web3, I would like to be part of the group that proves we can build a better governance and economic model for the world. My view on the Optimistic Vision: It is incredibly important that the vision emphasizes that building public goods can and will be incredibly profitable. This idea does not yet exist in any economy currently today as public goods are looked upon as something someone has to create but not generally profitable to the creator. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Any idea this new requires much experimentation in order to figure out what works and what does not. It is important to outline flexibility in the constitution at first for the aforementioned reason but also important that at some point we solidify the document to provide stability and set expectations for years to come.

As a delegate, I want to help turn this experiment into a thriving and longstanding culture, and to learn and contribute through my participation. My view on the Optimistic Vision : The core values that I\u2019ve been missing in Web 3.0\u2026 but still a long way. Retroactive public goods is not the sole solution, and will bring its own challenges. But Optimism should be more than just one approach\u2026 the emphasis is on prioritising the public good, and the rest will need to grow over time. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article 1 - flexibility and experimentation are essential at this stage\u2026 glad to see this recognised though I would hope these are imperatives in some sense for all Web 3.0 cultures. Article 2 - I agree wholeheartedly with the coexistence of individuals and voting power, and was drawn to Optimism as one of the few projects that recognise this. However, for me the key word is \u201cequally\u201d\u2026 how will this work over time? And does this mean we must constrain treatment of whale holders to nothing more than the lowliest of citizens? Perhaps this may need to change. Article 3 - this is one of the parts I\u2019m most interested in - the Foundation holds a lot of power at this early stage, and the success of this governance structure sits first and foremost with them. I see delegates as a key vector for scrutiny, and pledge to act as a check and balance on the power of the Foundation whilst the Collective continues to take shape.

It\u2019s Bankless\u2019s belief that the recycling of MEV back into the community is perhaps THE big unlock of the science of cryptoeconomics.   If the above statement is true, Bankless would like to help steer that that power into the future which maximizes its potential. Bankless believes that every significant technological breakthrough has a small window of opportunity to turn that neutral discovery into a positive discovery, and therefore it is imperative that we get rights right, early.  My view on the Optimistic Vision 96:  Bankless believes that the bull case for Ethereum is the scaling of public goods by aligning financial and monetary upside with the betterment of public goods. Ethereum is the handshake between Public goods Veblen Goods, formalizing the relationship between human values and the market value of the assets. We see Optimism as a testbed for projects that have the potential to expand beyond Optimism to greater Ethereum. If they can expand to Ethereum, we can expand it beyond Ethereum.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Optimism\u2019s working constitution is a document that illustrates the current state of the science of human political organization. The emphasis on the working part of the working document implies that we are using the current state of human organization as a checkpoint, with the intention to develop and iterate on that state with the cool new technologies being developed in the crypto space.  Decentralized identity Web-of-trust capital flows. Programmatic, contract-based governance (when applicable).

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Being a delegate is a significant responsibility. I have voted on all Phase 1 proposals so far, have studied all of the proposals listed, and provided many comments and questions that I hope assist the current delegates in evaluating proposals. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: The Optimistic vision tells us that \u201cWe\u2019re presented with an opportunity to reinvent the way we organize in this digital age.\u201d Sign me up! My view on the Optimistic Vision: Retroactive public goods funding is obviously paradigm-shifting. Providing individual rewards and recognition for positive impact to the community is a highly efficient allocation of capital and a structure that incentivizes good actors and outcomes for everyone. The ideals are, well, beautifully idealistic and we will have a lot of hard work to do to make the Optimism Vision a reality. Stay Optimistic! My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article 1 - The \u201cworking\u201d part of the Constitution sets us up for a really interesting experiment. Did the founding team leave us all with enough guardrails? I\u2019m looking forward to finding out! Article 2 - The bicameral structure is an important innovation to avoid the plutocratic character of much of the crypto space. Article 3 \u2013 the Optimism Foundation should publish opinions and guidance. Maximizing decentralization is an important aim, but guidance will help empower small OP holders to get involved alongside the handful of large delegates that are effectively controlling voting so far.  In evaluating all of the Phase 0 & 1 proposals so far, I have put in significant energy trying to align my voting with the spirit of the founding team, however it would be very nice to know more about what they think.

That means actively attending to the capacity as well as finding good things to do with it, and there\u2019s a ton of work embedded in that. I want to do that work. I see in Optimism an opportunity to play out my core belief that broadening stakeholder participation in a way that advantages growth is going to supplant legacy organizational models. Impact = Profit isn\u2019t just about aligning incentives so that an entire community benefits from policy and private activity. It\u2019s about reconsidering how we relate to one another, dropping zero-sum habits and aiming for growing overall bounties. In addition, as a founding core team member of Velodrome (2nd largest protocol on Optimism by TVL) and a long-term player in crypto, DeFi, and NFTs, I offer deep perspective in helping shape this direction. What\u2019s good for Optimism is good for my protocol; what\u2019s good for my protocol is good for Optimism. Velodrome can help to enact Optimism policy, and I intend to be one of hopefully many protocol liaisons to the Token House. More generally, I want a front row seat with a genuine attempt to explore new forms of governance that can be applied well beyond the scope of DeFi, etc. Becoming a delegate isn\u2019t just about promoting core ideals, however: I\u2019m also very competitive, and I want Optimism to win. Within Optimism we may aspire to be positive-sum, but in order to play this out completely, we need to demonstrate that we can also just work better than current alternatives in the market. So we need to win, and I want to help us get there. My view on the Optimistic Vision Reading through the other statements I\u2019m struck by applicants\u2019 enthusiasm about the possibilities of where correct digital democracy can take us: aligning stakeholders onchain and offchain; dodging the tragedy of the commons; provisioning and providing accessibility to underserved corners of societies; and so on. I share this enthusiasm, and it\u2019s what initially drove me to study and pursue alternative organizational models away from traditional corporate structures. Less attended to, however, is, ironically, the defining phrase of the Collective:  a new model of digital democratic governance,  optimized, to drive rapid and sustained growth of a decentralized ecosystem.  It\u2019s not enough to be satisfied with calling ourselves a new model \u2014 to me this statement is one of obligation. We need deliberate but rapid iteration \u2013 the optimization \u2014 which requires serious debate and decisive, data-driven action to make sure that this decentralized ecosystem will grow quickly and sustainably. Delegates need to be putting in the work here; weekly up/down votes are simply not enough. To do this work correctly, we need greater participation from protocols \u2014 which are extensions of our democratic model \u2014 to ensure our ideals are getting translated into action. This means that protocols should contribute to governance while being accountable. I\u2019ve written elsewhere that many questions about DAO governance are fundamental organizational questions that have been grappled with over ages. We can build on previous knowledge in many cases, and I think that\u2019s in part what I can offer here, having been an economist by training and profession. To summarize, we\u2019re all here because we agree we want the things outlined in the Vision. That\u2019s the given, and it\u2019s not enough for a delegate just to want this. Optimism\u2019s core work \u2013 the thing that delegates need to be laser-focused on \u2013 is how to use administrative, social, and market levers to make Optimism as a going concern last long enough and thrive well enough to even have a shot at achieving these things. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution Virtually all of the responses to this segment say something like \u201cThis is great and I like this.\u201d I do think this is great, and I do like this. But in the spirit of working beyond the commonly understood, I\u2019ll add some additional thoughts.   This is a \u201cWorking Constitution\u201d - That the constitution ought to be reconsidered does **not mean that community members and delegates can arbitrarily present standards as given without inviting serious pushback. The Constitution is still a foundational framework, and deviation or elaboration on this framework needs, at minimum, a paper trail.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective - We\u2019ve seen in history that bicameral governance structures allow a specialized minority Guardian class (here, Citizens) to hold disproportionate sway over broader policy. I think this frees up more space for the OP Holder class to allow for some more vote concentration, and ironically current fears about excessive concentration at the hands of protocols risk Optimism\u2019s early direction being managed by a minority of incumbent Delegates. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of getting more OP tokens delegated.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model - Until the Citizens take hold, it\u2019s probably acceptable to lean more on the Foundation for their guidance (where they\u2019re able to provide it), and as a Delegate I\u2019d work to incorporate more of their expertise into my own thinking. I\u2019m not sure to what extent Delegates have access to Foundation members, but they\u2019ve been thinking about these topics for as long as anybody in this thread.

With Velodrome being the second largest AMM on OP, I believe that I am more invested in the long-term success of Optimism than most people. I have staked my entire web3 reputation on exposing bad actors and lifting up good projects. I live in this ecosystem full time, 24/7, and am ready to help shape Optimism into the best L2 it can possibly be. My view on the Optimistic Vision 112: \u201cThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable.\u201d I have been saying this for a very long time. Public goods can take many shapes and sizes, and through retroactive public good\u2019s funding they can be profitable and investable by Angels and VCs. The weak link in all of this is us, and that\u2019s why I would like to be trusted as a delegate to vote on behalf of OP holders. If we are too tight or too loose in what we fund today, we can destroy this experiment before it even has a chance to gain traction. I want to help steer OP funding towards the most projects that will do real good both for the OP ecosystem but also the world at large. My views on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:    This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution.   All successful forms of government should be fluid and ever evolving. But what OP needs right now is a set of \u201cfounding Anons\u201d to help not only steer the creation of this living document but also protect it from corrupting forces.   OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.   This is the most innovative part of the OP governance structure and one that I am most excited to see play out in the long term. I also believe that this structure will allow us to balance short-term incentives with its long-term vision. And I hope to help shape how Citizens are chosen to represent their side of the government.   The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model   One reason to have delegates over the traditional model of governance is to ensure that we lean towards long-term growth vs. short term thinking. The overall mission of the Collective is lofty, and quite frankly, difficult. With the right people in place, I believe we can both listen to, and help educate the crowd towards creating true public goods.

I\u2019d like to actively contribute and support Optimism governance in any way that I can. Seeing how passionate and committed the Optimism community is toward bettering the governance process, proposing new ideas,  and providing feedback on critical topics has been inspiring.  I\u2019d like to join the ranks and become a part of the Optimistic crew that pushes the OP ecosystem to get better / grow. My view on the Optimistic Vision :  \" The Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable . The Collective will consistently provide massive retroactive incentives for public goods which benefit Optimism, Ethereum, and the Collective as a whole.  This excerpt really hit home for me. I have yet to see a similar vision elsewhere in the cryptoverse that aligns so closely with my own personal ethos. I expect my perspective to subtly shift over time as I continue my Web3 journey but I am fully certain that the base vision/foundation will remain grounded in this ideal. It does seem like a long leap from our current state to getting to a point of a sustainable system that can provide for human needs reliably, however, I do think we owe it to ourselves and others to do our best to make it a reality. I do think this vision will be challenged over time but in seeing how passionate contributors / delegates are already, I\u2019m very optimistic that we can achieve something great together. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution. It will be interesting to see how governance changes over time as delegates and community members help shift the roles and responsibilities. It\u2019s a noble effort to receive and act on feedback. Experimentation is how things evolve and get better.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective I believe this is one of the first attempts to utilize a bicameral structure for governance (that I am aware of). I\u2019d like to be a part of it.  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model It is important for the Foundation to be aware of the status of it\u2019s governance system but I also believe that it\u2019s healthy to allow it to grow within guiderails (and not be overly directly involved). I was pleasantly surprised at how well this balance was achieved on the first Optimism Governance Call on 8/2/2022.  Rights of OP Citizens and OP Holders I would be interested to review the process on how OP Holders can remove a director from the Optimism foundation. I do think it should require a majority vote from the OP holders (>66% approve), but not having seen the process I will reserve judgement until I conduct further research.  Interpretation Fully agree.  Always I\u2019m Optimistic by nature, I hope I will fit in!

An entire network committed to finding a way to fund and create public goods for all just has to end up doing something great and really speaks to the base integrity of the community. I was also drawn to the citizen house and token house approach to governance. I haven\u2019t spent much time (yet) in DAOs or other governance organizations, but the Optimism Collective approach sounded unique and very interesting. My view on the Optimistic Vision : In line with my reasons for wanting to be a delegate, the virtuous cycle of retroactive public goods funding is an exciting concept I want to be a part of. The long-term goal of crossing over into the physical world and funding public goods in that environment is very exciting. I think many governments around the world still operate by shipping he equivalent of one annual software cd rom update (a loaded up and heavily lobbied bill) instead of deploying weekly iOS app updates via agile government to solve problems one at a time (which RPGF could do, I think). My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: (i) I respect the acknowledgment that this is a governance experiment and it will evolve. We can\u2019t possibly know future the technologies, conflicts, and other challenges the future will bring, so evolving is key. (ii) I think the citizen house is very critical. If the goals and strategy of the network were left entirely to those with capital who will vote based on the best interest for their capital, I would not be engaged. I\u2019m very interested to see how the citizen house takes shape. (iii) I\u2019d like to see a transition to decentralization for the network as quickly as possible, but I do see short-term value in an authoritative entity which can guide the collective and make ongoing operational decisions until it is ready for full decentralization.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: We are a collective of PoolTogether community members. PoolTogether has been an active participant within the DeFi and DAO ecosystems since their inception. While being at the frontier of decentralized governance it is important to us continuously experiment and evolve.

We thrive to create a more fair and empathetic world where basic human needs are accessible to all. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1. This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution. Always has been. In a system with many moving parts, it is important to adapt to changes and constantly improve on learnings from the process. 2. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective. We agree. All life is about balance. As a community around a decentralized protocol that aims to serve as an important financial infrastructure owned by its users, we see this as an invitation to participate. 3. The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model. We see the Optimism Foundation as an important part of facilitating and stewarding the process while protecting the vision and constitution. We trust in its decisions and guidance.

I want to make the most promising project together. Give me a chance to be with you. My view on the Optimistic Vision: WEP1 has caused a lot of changes in people. It gave me a chance to take many things comfortably. WEP2 did not stop here but gave a lot of information, as well as a huge amount of influence and money to a small people. Optimism, will present a new direction of life, as well as enormous wealth, for everyone who is with them. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: New procedures are being created, so it won\u2019t be so smooth. The right path has not yet been established, which is clearly defined. Therefore, I think it will be criticized a lot and the fluctuation will be great. But I think we\u2019re going to walk the path we\u2019re going to pursue for four years and that path will be a compass for other projects to come in the future. I hope you walk on a nice road with many people.

Since the late 90s I\u2019ve been involded in various Linux related projects (LinuxPL, Debian), with Polish Linux Users Group and Polish chapter of Internet Society (ISOC PL). I\u2019ve been co-creating one of the biggest Polish libraries with public domain books, (WolneLektury). Since I\u2019ve been involved in crypto, I\u2019ve been helping Polish authorities to understand and appreciate public, permissionless blockchain infrastructure through education activities and involvement in public debate. I\u2019m a part of L2BEAT team, I\u2019m responsible for all governance related topics and I will be serving as L2BEAT delegate in all protocols that wer\u2019re involved with. As L2BEAT we understand the value and importance of public debate and governance processes and we want to provide our own resources to enhance those. We value open, transparent, permissionless systems and we would like to make sure that the ecosystems stays committed to those values. My role in the organisation is to be involved in all the relevant processes, providing time and resources to have a positive impact on the ecosystem. My view on the Optimistic Vision : I strongly believe that the power of communities comes from coordination around common values. I am a long-time supporter of public goods. I believe that through experimentation on public goods funding, open debate, and governance mechanisms we can have a positive impact on future communities that are going to evolve around the ecosystems that we\u2019re building today. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  We\u2019re still in the early days of improving governance mechanisms to make them work at scale in modern digital societies, it is absolutely obvious that any ruleset has to evolve while we learne. Strongly agree. We need to play both for the \u201chere and now\u201d goals, but with greater vision in mind. Our decisions need to take into account the long game and the interests of the whole community. That seems absolutely reasonable.

I like how you conceptualised the idea of a sustainable self governing system or at least what one might look like so early on and I share an equally optimistic vision for the future. It looks sweet and as I later state I am happy to be optimistic. My view on the first three articles of the Working constitution? I agree and own the risk of web3 commitment as I have sacrificed a lot already for it. I\u2019m pretty much all in on creating my vision from the future which aligns perfectly with optimism\u2019s, albeit from a musical core. I\u2019m passionate about creating social experiences for people as well as building efficient systems in and around it. My personal view is mostly all things in this space are an experiment at this time and it\u2019s about having the robustness to morph and change to adapt to the expanding marketplace. My skills and area of expertise? Songwriting, writing, poetry, all things music, nfts. I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment? Yes, I have always thought, I\u2019m a citizen of the world. Yet I didn\u2019t realise how optimistic I was for thinking that. All I can say is, it\u2019s a pleasure to be in good company. Now about me I\u2019m an artist, and a writer. Music is where my heart is, March of 2021 is where my journey in web3 with NFT\u2019s started. I hate that word. You see I\u2019ve always followed my heart. It sounds so sweet but being honest, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it cos it tastes like defeat. I could go on but I\u2019m not defeated yet. I guess that\u2019s what I love about optimism. It soldiers on. Even when all the light is gone. Somehow optimistically shining. In the dark be a light. Or fight for what\u2019s right as cool would say. Maybe this style of approach is uncouth, like a child still burdened with youth. Or is it searching for truth lost in cyberspace. It\u2019ll be fine either way. Citizens old and wise, citizens play, and citizens fight. In spite of human corruption trust-less systems are able to make things right, right? That would surely be nice. In fact it\u2019s haunted my dreams at night. There was a time I made history on layer one, and then layer two. All for fun too, but seriously. Hic Et Nunc came through. As did Quix (the market place) which I let some Heartbeats loose. 51 to be exact, and off they flew to live a life of their own. Once you propel something into space it continues going. You only need to steer the ship, I like that optimism recognises this as an experiment, with a good value system to learn and grow with through time, and as a member of the optimistic community, I would seriously take it upon myself to help guide the flight as best as possible. By being a steward of the light. As is my mission. My stance or position is simply one of inquisition, making cut throat decisions trying not to cut of circulation. There\u2019s more to this than just the exterior. Water yourself and then water someone else. Pass it on, tell a friend to tell a friend. Low and behold I\u2019ve been biding my time, lying in wait like a sleeper agent. Not a martyr for a cause more-like collecting karma points in wars. Bloodied and bruised, participating through every moment. Sore as well from being blindsided by your ever changing tide. It\u2019s funny how things change, but people stay the same. Though I\u2019ve met amazing people in this place. Among the toxicity within close proximity. Wading through the Nile of potential. With a form of togetherness. Like maybe one day we could live forever, and ever, I guess\u2026 but only if we\u2019re clever. So far Heartistry is an ecosystem that has grown with a similar vision to optimism. As part of a niche creative hub for a musical game and ethos of creation. Artists apart of it are only required to put their \u201cHeart, into their Artistry\u201d. As suggested in the name. Which is a verb, and a doing word. All projects released thus far have been performed, written, and published by me, Joe, with Heartistry. As an experiment if you will. For what publishing music on the blockchain with a method that is in favour of the artist might look like. With a focus on support and reward structures and social gamification. Maybe its nothing more than a pipe dream, but I remain optimistic My web3 interests are DAO\u2019s, Music, Governance, Gaming, Writing, Jingles, Poetry, Philosophy, NFT\u2019s, Experiences (Virtual/IRL). I speak English (EN) and that\u2019s the language I read and write. My favourite web3 projects are Fractal Visions, Heartistry, and Dread Heads. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate are simple. I believe that there needs to be people with good hearts and intentions in positions where they can influence things for the better. As a representative of Heartistry, being a delegate for optimism would allow me to put artists first and support web3 music creators and artists in general, onboarding them through the optimism network, benefiting both ecosystems as well as everyone connected through the chain. After all maybe we\u2019re one and the same. Thanks for taking the time to read my commitment.  Joe Nix (Founder) of Heartistry  ",

Public goods are good. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Experimentation is key, providing that the security of the network is ensured. Careful, battle tested iteration in governance processes should be the standard. Engaging community members & being able to enact their wishes in a trust-minimized system should by design procreate positive outcomes for network participants as the Optimism Collective, & indeed those outside of the network. If the Optimism Collective can unite ideas and align incentives for the better, the whole world stands to benefit. Though, we should also pay close attention to certain attack vectors- ensuring that the system cannot be exploited as per the wants of the few. Optimism Foundation plays a crucial role in on-going governance iteration process, ecosystem growth & coordination, as well as global Optimism adoption. At this stage, the success of Optimism governance still depends on such solid early stewardship for long term health as well as security.

From the innovative method to distribute OP to maximise social impact to its bicameral governance structure, I believe many important things are being tried out here which can assist all of us. Decentralised Governance protocols like this one require people lending their expertise to discuss and craft the best possible version of something, and I want to lend my (limited) hand in this. Currently my main focus has been in assisting the ParaSwap DAO with governance, where I work to build a protocol that strives to be a decentralised public good for everyone to be able to access DeFi with. An example of this is our current experimentation with the idea of  Social Escrow, in which protocol fees would be distributed to users that provide the most Positive Externalities to the protocol. I\u2019ve wanted to contribute to build here for a while, but to be honest, I always considered my impact would be quite limited as a delegate. However, the Protocol Delegate initiative has been the perfect idea to kickstart my participation in the collective, as now I could both represent the interests of my current most-devoted-to DAO while helping build on the Collective! From here, I hope to slowly grow as a delegate that people are familiar with. My view on the Optimistic Vision : The Optimistic vision is something that I find both ambitious and incredibly encouraging in equal parts. After all, the idea of having a collective that manages to foster public goods sustainably is one that society has struggled to accomplish (or even try) for hundreds of years. Despite this cynical take, I believe that Web 3 not only strongly needs to try to follow this ideals as well as they can, but also that thanks to the unique mindset of Web3 of Decentralisation, Open Source and Decentralised Governance we have a pretty good shot of building something great here. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  I understand, and welcome this approach of experimentation. The whole space is only a few years old, so it makes sense that we must iterate and grow over time for the Working Constitution as well. I am excited to see this bicameral system being used for Optimistic Governance. Similar to what I said in my first point, our current systems of governance are new, so this new approach to balancing short and long term visions is exciting. As many others have said before, I understand the need of the Foundation to assist with the establishment of the collective, and over time decentralise itself more and more as the Collective becomes self-sustaining and resilient.

These values being created in crypto have the ability to live beyond blockchain technology, and that\u2019s why we need to focus on them. Arriving at a place where developing public goods is profitable and attractive at scale is hard to say the least. The Optimistic Vision is a bold north star to work upon and it\u2019s amazing to be a part of it at the protocol, and hopefully soon, at the delegate level. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  We\u2019re definitely still at an experimental stage. We should continue to try new things and be open to failures. What I hope to push is the idea of positivity, regardless of outcome. This experiment should be fun and engaging. At QiDao Protocol, we\u2019ve been working on multi-cameral systems of governance. We\u2019ve seen that the strict token-holder DAO model isn\u2019t conducive to long-term strategies and planning.

The nature of our work gives us a perspective on building on Optimism that few teams or individuals can match, and being delegates will enable us to channel this insight toward policies that we believe will enable Optimism to meet its objectives. My view on the Optimistic Vision : The core principles underlying the Vision are foundational to our protocol. Velodrome is a public good: we raised no money, gave virtually all of our votepower away to ecosystem protocols, OP Labs, prospective users, and Optimism airdroppees, and are laying out initiative after initiative intended to broaden stakeholdership of our protocol and of Optimism more generally. We structured Velodrome to allow anyone seeking to build to bootstrap funding without appealing directly to private capital and for veVELO lockers to benefit from economic activity in the ecosystem. Why did we do this? We believe that the promise of decentralized finance is not to enrich the few but to freely provide accessible technology facilitating economic activity: a financial Internet, in effect. Optimism is in our view the first true broad-based attempt to make this a reality, and we believe it\u2019s our job to help shepherd this project in its early but critical days. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  The fact that we as a protocol are now being offered votepower is testament to Optimism\u2019s commitment to experimentation, continuous improvement, and broadening notions of representation. And now that we\u2019re joining the efforts, we recognize we won\u2019t get everything right at the start \u2014 but ensuring that every major player shares these core values and commits to putting in the effort will get us to the right place. We\u2019ve observed a lot of difficulty and confusion that result from imperfect delegation practices and the \u2018one token, one vote\u2019 construction. Our view here follows from the first point, which is that finding new ways to enfranchise committed players will help us as a community move beyond the first generation of governance structures in organizations. We look forward to seeing the first public implementation of Citizen House. From the start, we have worked closely with the Optimism Foundation and love having them as partners. We\u2019re also deeply cognizant of their desire to decentralize as much as possible and the challenge they\u2019ve faced walking the tightrope between being active stewards and allowing governance to do its thing. The Protocol Delegation Program is an example of the kind of care they\u2019re showing in helping the organization mature, and we\u2019re thrilled to be expanding our partnership to this domain.  **My Web3 interests:**Choose \u2264 five from the following set.

My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Our mission is to build powerful tools for liquidity providers in AMM protocols while keeping them open and accessible to everyone My view on the Optimistic Vision : Sincerely inspiring. Finding new ways of organizing and collaborating, freely, is one of the most important things for humans to iterate on given our shared new communication capabilities. We believe programmable and decentralized financial systems, like the ones being built over Ethereum and Optimism, are setting the foundation for these types of experiments, and the Optimistic vision of harnessing that towards public goods is a great and concise manifesto of such an experiment we want to collaborate with. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1. This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution. We believe this is the only way to have chance of achieving the Optimistic vision. We can\u2019t foresee all the challenges  and requirements for this experiment to be a success because. This has not been tried before, in the long run having a solid bedrock constitution will be required to avoid the capture of the collective by interests not well aligned with the Vision, but there is much to learn before we can get to that. 2. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective. I think plutocracy would not be well aligned with the above discussed Optimistic Vision, so finding a way for the collective to self-govern without becoming one is a basic requirement. 3. The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model. Again, I believe the only way to achieve the long term goal of the vision is iteratively and progressive decentralization is a requirement given the unexplored territory we are traversing.

My view on the Optimistic Vision : By fully understanding the core ethos of the Ethereum network itself, Optimistic Vision represents a brilliant view on decentralized governance and how it can be structured to be in complete symbiosis with the nature of the communities born out of it. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1. This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution. With the rapidly evolving and ever changing nature of web3 space, highly adaptable and constantly improving Constitution is the most optimal approach when compared to fixed model of governing. 2. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective. By prioritizing finding a balance between short-term and long-term, the Collective is bound to organically gravitate towards evolving to become the most optimal governance structure for open networks. 3. The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model. In a rapidly changing and evolving space such as this, it is suboptimal to rush into a fully open governance model before there is enough time to organically develop a strong community foundation with Optimism\u2019s best interest at heart.

Now that we are building a formal governance roll-out in 2023 for Premia, I am taking a more proactive approach in both being a liaison for cross-project gov representation, but also to learn from more established groups by being an active member. With the goal being to research, engage, and weaponize what works and apply to the Premia Ecosystem. As far as I know, Premia is the only market for OP Token options and has written over 12mm in optimistic native options since we launched on Optimism at the beginning of August 2022. The Premia Core team would love the opportunity to work together contributing as a valued partner & participant in the expanding optimism ecosystem. My view on the Optimistic Vision: After spending the last 6mo reviewing governance structures, missions, purposes, legal entity jurisdictions, voting methods, etc., I can appreciate that it is no small feat with all the brainstorming and modeling that must have went into the collective and ultimately the optimistic vision.  One thing that I can say for certain is that I kept coming back and studying not only the OP governance system, but also personally resonating with the ethos behind the collective.  That alignment is why I am back after crawling around gov forums for months, hopefully to further learn from the community and collective to build a common good in an economically responsible way. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution : Honestly, at first was taken back by the simplicity of the constitution.  I have internally conflicting thoughts on protocol constitutions as a governing document (legal devil on my shoulder), however experimenting in the open is the way to move decentralized organizations forward.  So many \u201cDAOs\u201d today are cookie cutter, that personally I feel we have hit a mild plateau in innovation, or that the large monolith DAOs are stuck, whether intentional or not. The need to rapidly iterate in a responsible manner, testing novel concepts or approaches to what participatory and collaborative decentralized enterprises can achieve.  Lastly, completely agree on the involvement of the Foundation, oversight is needed while the collective matures, and in reality that will take time to grow and flourish, especially in a time of uncertain regulatory approach.

I am excited to be able to shift this dynamic together with the Collective. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: We are pioneering new territories in the democratic process of creating sustainable, decentralized, public goods. A first phase must include a trial and error approach. It will be critical, though, to constantly monitor, measure, and evaluate what works and what doesn\u2019t to refine experiments in a positive loop. The bicameral structure is very fascinating, and although I understand the need for an initial steering entity, I am excited to help the Collective develop in the areas of governance, public funding, and impact measurement.

My skill set from close to 5 years of experience building and working with projects in DeFi could potentially help the Optimism Collective fulfill its objectives and add value to the Optimism ecosystem. As part of the team leading KyberSwap\u2019s initiatives related to our own DAO governance and KNC tokenomics, I am interested in playing a key role in how the Optimism Collective coordinates public goods for the benefit of all ecosystem participants. My view on the Optimistic Vision: My team and I are inspired by the Optimistic Vision and would like to support it at a deeper level. I feel that KyberSwap\u2019s vision - to create a liquidity hub for the decentralized economy so that DeFi is accessible to all - strongly complements the Optimistic Vision of a coordinated, collaborative cyberspace, where we can be united in our efforts to bring positive change and impact to as many people and projects as possible through public goods. It would not be easy to achieve this vision for sure, but in my opinion, Optimism has laid a solid foundation and is well-positioned to make it a reality. The Optimistic Vision is also very much aligned with our own interests in decentralized governance and our belief that positive impact to the ecosystem/collective should be efficiently and fairly rewarded to the builders, users, and value creators that contribute the most. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   Decentralized governance and DAOs are in a nascent stage and will definitely experience growing pains. As such, it is indeed prudent to undergo a few years of experimentation and treat the Working Constitution as a \u2018living\u2019 entity that evolves over time based on lessons learnt, instead of relying on a rigid, fixed model. However, it is imperative that this commitment to experimentation is concurrently anchored by the shared Optimistic Vision and the core values of the collective, to ensure a united and harmonious community focused on the same objectives.   We agree with Optimism\u2019s use of a bicameral governance system. Checks and balances are necessary for any governance model, especially in relation to public goods. In the context of simple token-based voting, it is possible for a few large token holders to accumulate massive voting power to serve their own interests instead of benefiting the collective or wider ecosystem. A bicameral governance system with retroactive public goods funding based on past contributions and governed by the Citizens\u2019 House could potentially mitigate such plutocracy. This would in turn provide long-term, sustainable incentives for the participants that create the most value on Optimism.   For the purpose of efficiency and practicality, we agree that the Optimism Foundation would be a good initial steward of the collective and its early governance model. This helps ensure a more structured establishment and management of the collective as it takes its baby steps. Similar to what KyberSwap is implementing, the Optimism Foundation should adopt an approach of progressive decentralization while maintaining a high level of transparency and adherence to its core values. We are confident that the Optimism Foundation will act in the best interests of the collective.

My view on the Optimistic Vision:  We are strongly influenced by the Optimistic Vision and want to support it on a deeper level. A lot of open-source contributors are not adequately compensated. The optimistic vision of funding is the best way to reshape rewards and create a future narrative full of positivity & hope. The Optimistic Vision is closely connected with our interests in decentralised governance and our faith that a positive impact to the ecosystem should be effectively and equally incentivised to the most active builders, users, and value creators. Programmable and decentralised financial systems, such as those built on Ethereum and Optimism, are laying the groundwork for these kinds of studies/experiments.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Checks and balances are essential for every governance model, particularly regarding public goods. In the rapid phase of development that happens on Optimism, it is prudent to take on a governance model that is fluid and conducive to continuous experimentation that can help the collective learn more about the ecosystem it fosters. By having a bicameral system of governance, Token House and Citizen House ensures that Optimism keeps up with the growing challenges of the day while keeping each chamber in check of the other and adequately balancing short-term gain with long-term vision. In the 3rd article, given the uncharted territory, the only way (pragmatic one) to reach the vision\u2019s long-term goal is iterative, and progressive decentralisation is necessary.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: As a representative of dHEDGE and Toros Finance protocol, I am committed to the success of the Optimism ecosystem. I believe Optimism has the potential to be the future of Ethereum and my experience in various Defi protocols and strategic contributions can help the ecosystem thrive. Our interests are aligned with the prosperity of Optimism. My view on the Optimistic Vision : The Optimistic Vision offers an insightful perspective on decentralized governance and how it can work harmoniously with the communities that utilize the Ethereum network. This understanding of the fundamental principles of Ethereum is key to the success of this vision. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution.  The crypto and DeFi space changes so rapidly so it\u2019s imperative to be adaptable. This is especially relevant in governance, so allowing this flexibility allows the constitution to evolve over time.  OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.  The Collective\u2019s focus on balancing short-term and long-term goals will naturally lead to the development of the most efficient governance structure for open networks  The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.  It is important to take the time to build a solid community foundation with the best interests of Optimism in mind before transitioning to a fully open governance model. This is especially important in a rapidly changing and evolving field like this one My Web3 interests: Decentralized finance, protocol growth. Languages I speak and write: English.

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  This is a \u201cworking\u201d constitution: As we navigate through a constantly changing world, it is important for our blockchain governance to be flexible and adaptable to reflect the evolving nature of human behavior and lifestyles. To achieve this, we must embrace innovation and continually seek out new ways to improve and refine our framework. OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective: In order to ensure the success of our governance model, it is essential that we align short-term incentives with long-term visions.

Optimism\u2019s technology and scaling solution is essential to the mass adoption of Decentralized finance and it is something I aim to support and contribute to. Decentralized governance requires participation from interested parties to share and collaborate on a collective vision. My view on the Optimistic Vision 2: The Optimistic Vision is a revolutionary step towards decentralized coordination that leverages the strengths of Defi communities. The shift towards public goods in cyberspace is a monumental change in the way we have thought about cooperation and alignment in the past. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  The flexibility of a working Constitution will be paramount to the success of this governance experiment. It is important to understand that the ability to change course will be the key to a successful governance structure that can keep pace with the continually changing Defi landscape. A Bicameral governance structure with proper checks and balances is absolutely necessary at this scale to ensure interest alignment. I believe the Optimism Foundation is necessary to support Optimism\u2019s infrastructure at this time.

We feel deeply aligned with the Optimism vision. Governing an open organization in an effective way is not easy. We know from our own experience. Optimism has worked with tremendous commitment towards creating an effective governance model. We are keen to share what we have learned from past successes and pitfalls alongside our expertise on security in order to help develop and drive growth to the entire ecosystem. My view on the Optimistic Vision 138:  impact=profit. We are in a unique position in history where we have the chance to disrupt existing norms around growth and profit and Optimism has the potential to become one of the main players driving change. Value-aligned. Code4rena\u2019s model was built on the notion that security is a collaborative, community effort. Code4rena pioneered new mechanisms in the security auditing space that have led to more efficient timeframes, and higher coverage making us one of the biggest security communities on Ethereum. We\u2019re proud of the resources we\u2019ve been able to create for security researchers and developers making it clear that impact=profit.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Honest and logical. We are all sailing in uncharted territories where there are no fixed solutions and definite answers. Introducing a working constitution with room for experimentation is in our opinion one of Optimism\u2019s biggest strengths. It takes time, self-organization, feedback, a humble mentality, and commitment to run an initiative like this and shows a long-term commitment and vision. Introducing the widely used and tested bicameral governance system is a good step towards effective governance and balance between tactics and strategy. We are excited to see and potentially help come up with upgraded iterations of this model based on feedback and observations so far. We firmly believe in one innovation at a time. Systems take a long time to mature, especially in rapidly moving environments, for this reason, the involvement of the Foundation is necessary.

As someone who\u2019s a long-time startup operator, I find the mission to dispel the myth of public goods vs. profitability to be a cause I\u2019d like to support. As someone building governance tooling for Optimism (Agora), I am both deeply interested in helping improve the governance experience as a whole and also sharing our learnings and experiences to support other projects and builders. From a practical perspective, we bring forth a group of builders and operators with deep operational, financial and product experience across both web3 and TradFi. My view on the Optimistic Vision: Public goods are often the backbones of most of our favorite tools on the internet. Yet they\u2019re woefully underfunded, undersupported, and understaffed. The fact that Optimism wants to change this is inspiring, and I\u2019d like to do my part in contributing to this mission. I deeply believe in the phrase: \u201cshow me the incentives, and I will show you the result\u201d, and I believe if Optimism is successful, it can greatly improve the incentive dynamics of how builders and participants behave in the web3 ecosystem. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Agreed \u2013 Permanent structures often have unintended consequences. So I like the explicit framing of this as an experiment with an expiry date. However, I would add that it\u2019s also important to strike a balance between exploratory vs. doubling down for results (which often requires executing consistently over a longer period of time). I believe the key here lies in the time-frame of each objective. Agreed \u2013 While this balance of short-term vs. long-term is crucial. I think it\u2019s one of those \u201ceasy to say, hard to execute\u201d statements. Incentives will ultimately drive this behavior and I\u2019ve seen it corrupted time and time again in organizations, which I think ties nicely into #3. Agreed \u2013 I\u2019m supportive because I think the role of the Foundation is crucial especially at the early stages of kickstarting a flywheel. As the ecosystem grows, the jobs to be done that the Foundation initially takes on does not disappear, but rather decentralizes into other stewards among the community.

Our team believes in not only in the underlying technology but also in the values and ethics embedded into it. Optimism and the OP Stack are set to play an important role in scaling Ethereum to the world, and we want to play an active role in steering the Collective toward this goal. My view on the Optimistic Vision : Trying to make true public goods profitable is an ambitious goal, yet Optimism is already making an impressive amount of progress! Our team is looking forward to the next round of RPGF, and we believe these processes will continue maturing and fund more than just developer tools. We can\u2019t wait to go to the first park funded by RPGF! My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1: It is very early in the history of decentralized governance, so it\u2019s important that documents and processes are not too rigid. We love that Optimism not only encourages but enshrines experimentation into its Constitution. The Collective has already seen some great governance experiments, and some not-so-great ones. What\u2019s important is that the community was critical and introspective afterward and made changes when necessary. 2: We look forward to the upcoming introduction of OP Citizens! Bicameral governance is underexplored in this space, and we think Citizens will bring a healthy balance to the current token-voting process. The Collective will surely come out stronger from any conflicts between the Citizen and Token Houses! 3: Our view is that the Foundation has been a good steward of the Collective. We only ask for continued transparency and regular reporting, the recap/feedback posts from Foundation members are important discussions that drive this community forward.

Personally I enjoy witnessing different forms of collective decision making, iteration on that and innovating how these can best serve the actual goals they are aiming for. Especially with many outside stakeholders incentives play a crucial role here and being able to contribute to these decisions and later on the processes around them is something which I\u2019m personally excited to be part of. My view on the Optimistic Vision 135: The optimistic perspective to use digital democratic governance as a trial ground to experiment with collective decision making and adequate incentives deeply resonates with my personal ideas of innovation. It will be fascinating to observe how the alignment of decision structures to be iterated on and impact=profit incentives can lead to outcomes ultimately more beneficial to the public and all stakeholders. This will be particularly groundbreaking once the ideas and learnings generated in this process can extend beyond just within the ecosystem but can be applied on a broader spectrum exceeding the borders of the digital realms. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  I strongly believe in iteration and constant improvement based on hypotheses, prototypes and subsequent feedback. After a long enough time-period there will hopefully be a solid enough foundation to establish a more permanent constitution. Still that one should be open for adaptation at certain time intervals. Balance of power is essential to prevent few stakeholders from having too much influence on decisions (e.g. large OP holders) and therefore undermining an unbiased governance process having resilience against manipulation and nepotism. It makes sense to still have the OP foundation as steward for now, as long as over the long-term more decentralization will be pursued.

Optimism is important to provide a similar user experience that newcomers are accustomed to on centralized exchanges like Binance/Coinbase or platforms like Etoro/Robinhood because transactions are cheap and instantaneous. Also, Optimism is the Synthetix playground that powers synthetic assets. Synthetix could have a central place in making DeFi mainstream as it offers the infrastructure to provide a \u201ccross-chain experience\u201d (like sSOL-sAVAX), massive liquidity without price impact/slippage, and real-world assets. My view on the Optimistic Vision:  impact=profit \u2014 the principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.  This sentence is the most significant. The initial crypto vision is to positively impact the world rather than an individual. Satoshi is the best example.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: impact = profit is a mantra that is slowly being adopted in the physical world, it is akin to pay for performance. Far too many open source or free projects do not receive adequate funding to survive - how many times have we seen Wikipedia ask for a $1 donation from its users? The Optimistic Vision doesn\u2019t just provide a means for creators and innovators to survive, it gives them a means to pursue their creativity.

The scaling technology of Optimism plays an important role in our success and we are excited to participate in the decentralized governance to drive the Optimism protocol towards its goals. My view on the Optimistic Vision : The Optimistic Vision is an innovative step towards the digital democratic governance. The retroactive incentives for public goods bring a big change to how the traditional collaboration works. I\u2019m inspired by the ambition of extending beyond crypto and cyberspace to impact the physical world for human needs at scale. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  As this is a fast-moving space and this is an entirely new experiment, being flexible and adaptable is important to achieve the long-term success. The coexistence of OP Citizens and OP holders brings balance between short-term and long-term incentives. It is an innovative improvement to the simple token based governance model and could lead to better decisions made by the governance. I believe the early leaders are essential for this experiments and hope the model is moving towards full dencentralization over time.

We\u2019ve supported DeFi projects on Optimism and continue to support user growth through grants and research as a values aligned project living on Optimism. As delegates, we\u2019d be excited to continue learning from each other, sharing best practices from Uniswap governance and continuing to support the flourishing DeFi ecosystem with LM and more novel incentive programs. The Uniswap Community Delegates will have voices from a group of stakeholders that share a vested interest in both protocols\u2019 successes, including the Uniswap Foundation and other existing Uniswap/Optimism delegates who may not have a voice yet and others that want to have a greater platform to identify areas for growth. My view on the Optimistic Vision: Both Uniswap and Optimism were grant funded projects that I have personally been involved with, and as a group we understand deeply the fundamental importance of supporting public goods. We believe the surface area for how to best support public goods is still underexplored and we not only agree with the Optimistic Vision, but want use this platform to leverage both communities to identify, govern, and rapidly iterate on novel resource allocation models. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  As decentralized governance continues to be explored, we agree that an evolving Working Constitution is the right path forward. This is something Uniswap delegates have discussed at length and are learning so much from what Optimism has already done. Establishing a Bedrock Constitution will set a new precedent for how these types of institutions can continue to grow with greater oversight and ensure committed parties create amendments to adapt to our growing ecosystems, within and on top of Optimism. The Uniswap governance process was established early but continues to improve based on the input of our own delegates. Seeing how active Optimism governance due to the bicameral governance system is something to aspire to. We\u2019re excited for the shared learnings that can be adopted for both governance systems with a rapidly growing ecosystem through experimentation, especially when thinking about \u201cproper\u201d impact measures. Speaking on behalf of the Uniswap Foundation, we have worked closely with members of the Optimism Foundation since our inception. As our protocols grow together, we would want to share all that we\u2019ve learned from our community of users, developers, and delegates so that others can leverage best practices where helpful.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: We share the vision that web3 will enable new economic models built on decentralized public goods that benefit the communities that create, maintain, and govern them \u2014 thus dispelling the myth that public goods cannot be profitable. As a public good itself, 0x Protocol builds under a similar vision of serving as a propellant for growth within the larger blockchain economy that leads to a virtuous cycle of impact-driven expansion. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   These are still very much the early days of the blockchain ecosystem, and we expect that new paradigms will emerge that will make change necessary \u2014 we think that it is a very sensible approach to have an iterative working constitution that supports experimentation and innovation before ossifying to a bedrock constitution.   We agree that a thoughtful, incentive-based system of checks and balances is fundamental to ensuring the integrity and legitimacy of a sustainable governance structure.   Tying in with the first point of this being a period of many changes, we concur with the need for the Optimism Foundation to fulfill the role of prime mover for governance experimentation and support its stewardship of the Optimism Collective in its early forms.

But, beyond the technical prowess, the Beethoven X community champions a more than \u201cjust tech\u201d philosophy. We bring with us an evolved ecosystem that merges creativity, technology, community, product and social impact into a sophisticated conglomeration that aims to cultivate the best possible environment for the ecosystem users to thrive. With a focus on the wider social, behavioral, educational and collective picture, evidenced by in-depth social science studies, we celebrate the people in our communities and strive to create a place optimal for growth and development. As such, Beethoven X would be honored to play a part and complement the sophisticated ideologies associated with the Optimism collective. My view on the Optimistic Vision : My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   Imagine a world where political systems, governance structures and policies are rooted in collective liberation, social justice and compassion. Imagine a world where governance is continuously iterated upon and adapted towards systems that benefit all.   Imagine a world where individuals, collectives and communities challenge the social constructs of our time to rebuild a system that serves us all. Imagine a world where the vision of the community and the individual are one. To thrive, to flourish, to blossom.   Imagine a collective that believes wholeheartedly in the progression and growth of the ecosystem while understanding the necessity for decentralization. Imagine a world where the foundation aids in the creation of a system but slowly steps back to allow beauty to flourish.   A world beyond finance, where innovation meets imagination. Imagination lies at the core of DeFi. The following articles closely intertwine with our dreams for a collective, social, adaptable and flourishing world of finance.

We understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes, we understand Our reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Socket has been live on Optimism since November \u201821 & one of the first few chains we launched on. We share a similar vision with Optimism Foundation that the next billion users will experience all of web3 on L2s, and have been working to solve one of the key pieces to enable this vision by collaborating with the top Optimism apps including Synthetix, Lyra, Polynomial, Premia among others. We believe to catalyse the growth of Optimism & push it to the centre of all L2 innovation, current protocols have a huge role to play. With this delegation Socket aims to work with Optimism ecosystem to make sure the voice of protocols is represented in the forums. We also intend to work closely with the Collective & ecosystem to ensure cooperation on long-term initiatives that can cement Optimism as the leading L2 in the space! Our view on the Optimistic Vision 1: The public-goods centric vision and the multiple steps taken by Optimism Collective does to make it a reality is highly commendable & has helped to steward the whole space.  We ourselves have public goods offerings as part of our suite including Socketscan, Refuel that aim to create positive-sum impact for both users & protocols in the space! Another great plus of the Vision is the thought of having governance baked in thus encouraging a diverse representation of views/stakeholders. Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  Strongly agree with the flexibility aspect is ideal since it\u2019s still early days to define what good governance structures should look like We are also a big fan of the idea of dual stakeholders, Citizens & Token holders that ensures the balance of power while retaining ability to work on long-term initiatives  Our Web3 interests: DeFi, Wallets,Gaming, NFTs & Infrastructure Languages we speak and write: English ",

Being a delegate will allow Odos to continue to integrate, interact with, and grow this diverse ecosystem. We will also be able to participate in and learn from Optimism\u2019s unique governance structure and setup as Odos continues to grow as a project. My view on the Optimistic Vision : Odos is built on the many AMM, lending protocols, liquid staking platforms, and other projects that make up the DeFi ecosystem and remain open for anyone to use. As such, Odos is a big believer in the power of public goods and wholeheartedly supports the Optimistic Vision to encourage the creation of more public goods. Odos will also continue to explore the creation of public good systems for the Optimism ecosystem My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:   This is a very powerful and important article that supports the explorative nature of the Optimism Collective\u2019s governance experiment. Being able to adapt and learn and slowly ossify the structure of the governance will be key to its long-term success   Having two houses of people with different underlying distributions of incentives, interests, and goals both working towards the collective good of the ecosystem will allow for a much more balanced and effective governance of the platform.   In the same way a flexible definition of governance is useful in the initial formative years of Optimism, a more formal organized group of people is also very useful to ensure things go smoothly while Optimism grows into a stable and prosperous fully decentralized ecosystem.

We have good observations about needs of users - LPs, arbitrage traders, \u201cmanual\u201d traders. Thus, we believe that our contribution to Optimism governance would be very positive for the ecosystem. My view on the Optimistic Vision 149: The Optimistic Vision touches upon \u201cdecentralized democracy\u201d topic. We have pioneered few models around that (such as ve-tokens), and very much share this vision. It will though be a long way before decentralized governance can truly expand to real world, and we all have to learn and experiment a lot before then. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  100% - in view of what was said before - experimentation is good! Resonates with us also (ve-token model was exactly to counter-act shortcomings of simple token governance). But maybe one can do better? Let\u2019s see! This looks a bit like progressive decentralization, starting centralized. We don\u2019t use that approach, but of course we would really love to see everything transitioning to fully decentralized as fast as possible.

Further, my experience over the last year and a half participating as a member of the Synthetix and Lyra grants councils has provided experience in governance and vetting public goods funding. My view on the Optimistic Vision 150: I think funding public goods is a worthy goal but one that, in practice, needs to improve in efficiency and quality. Finding ways to ensure that quality projects that have a long-term alignment with Optimism is key. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I think a working constitution makes sense and that no decentralized entities have truly figured out decentralized governance yet. I think my experience with Synthetix governance gives some context in what works and what doesn\u2019t. Checks and balances should exist within a framework of action rather than status quo. Avoiding ossification and pivoting from mistakes or learning into wins will be important. I think the Optimism Foundation has done a reasonable job at acting as steward to the Collective, but may be more effective in providing more strongly stated opinions on certain issues within governance at times.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes I understand. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:  To identify and support individuals and entities committed to creating valuable public goods To shift perspective from financial gain as the only measure of success To improve the community and create long-term, sustainable value To align with our duty to serve the best interests of the community To position the protocol for potential benefits by supporting these value creators To contribute to a prosperous future and the betterment of society  My view on the Optimistic Vision: My perspective on the vision statement is that it represents a paradigm shift away from the traditional nation-state system towards a more global, inclusive, and advanced society. I believe that by seeding new education systems, providing unbiased and non-partisan media, and implementing digital methods for problem-solving, we can create a more informed and collaborative community. Furthermore, I see this vision as an opportunity to attract talent who are not solely motivated by personal profit and to provide opportunities for individuals to do good and benefit from it. I am optimistic that this vision will lead to a more sophisticated and equitable society. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: My perspective on the working constitution is that while it may be optimistic to believe that a permanent bedrock constitution can be established within 4 years, I am hopeful that the adaptive, flowing and always-evolving code, guarded by a new collective, will eventually lead to a better society. However, I am skeptical of the idea that society will be able to avoid power consolidation, as history has shown that those in power often resist change and attempt to maintain their position, even if it means taking society a step backward. I believe that it is important to acknowledge that change is constant and that the constitution must adapt to this reality. However, I also recognize that power consolidation is a real concern and must be actively avoided in order for society to move forward.

Thus, it is essential for us to maintain good communication with all of the protocols that we connect to, as well as the ones that decide to integrate us for their aggregation options. This places ParaSwap in a position where not only do we wish to acquaint ourselves with all major DeFi protocols of the space, but also where the success of these protocols and the Optimism system in general also directly benefits the protocol, leading to a positive sum situation where the protocol is incentivised to ensure the sustainable growth of the Optimism ecosystem. However, I think that our greatest alignment with the optimism ecosystem extends further than just being an aggregator, and more also into the core principles that are more unique to ParaSwap. In a similar vein to Optimism, ParaSwap has built itself with the long-term vision of being a public good middleware which facilitates access to the web3 space. We believe that ParaSwap not only serves as a public good which assists with the access to the decentralised world, but also helps maintain things decentralised. A good example of this is liquidity pools, where rather than having to concentrate all capital into a recognisable pool, ParaSwap allows pools to be decentralised and be able to compete with each other to provide the best final rates for the users, using whichever innovative approach they decide. One major example of our commitment to become a socially-aligned public goodcan be seen in the recently passed PSP 2.0 proposal from our DAO. In it, we not only decide to allocate 80% of accrued fees to our staked users, but we also experiment with the introduction of a new system in the DeFi space of Social Escrow. The idea of social escrow is to allocate the fees to users that contribute the most positive externalities to the protocol. My view on the Optimistic Vision: These are the views of the Optimistic Vision from current Protocol Representative @Oxytocin :  The Optimistic vision is something that I find both ambitious and incredibly encouraging in equal parts. After all, the idea of having a collective that manages to foster public goods sustainably is one that society has struggled to accomplish (or even try) for hundreds of years. Despite this cynical take, I believe that Web 3 not only strongly needs to try to follow this ideals as well as they can, but also that thanks to the unique mindset of Web3 of Decentralisation, Open Source and Decentralised Governance we have a pretty good shot of building something great here.  My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: These are the views of the Working Constitution from current Protocol Representative @Oxytocin :    I understand, and welcome this approach of experimentation. The whole space is only a few years old, so it makes sense that we must iterate and grow over time for the Working Constitution as well.    I am excited to see this bicameral system being used for Optimistic Governance. Similar to what I said in my first point, our current systems of governance are new, so this new approach to balancing short and long term visions is exciting.    As many others have said before, I understand the need of the Foundation to assist with the establishment of the collective, and over time decentralise itself more and more as the Collective becomes self-sustaining and resilient.

I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes I understand. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: I have been interested in OP governance from the start. However, I have never had enough time to engage in discussions, writing proposals and becoming worthy of the delegate role. Now that I have quit my job and joined web3 full-time, I do have enough time for exactly that. I find the OP vision admirable and would like to support the values that come along with public goods. I look after a small community of 50-100 people that I have introduced to OP governance on Snapshot. I received feedback that some of them would like to delegate to someone that they know. Here I am, ready to do my service  My view on the Optimistic Vision: When I tell my non crypto friends that Optimism is giving away free tokens to early users and to projects building on it they always ask me: \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d As far as I can oversee our business world, Optimism is pioneering a new way of developing projects and rewarding and incentivising users. Instead of throwing money at behemoths like Google or Facebook to do advertisements, the money ends up directly in the real users/projects pockets - fantastic. Public goods are our most sacred goods that we must nourish and support at all cost. To me this is a revolution. One I want to be part of. My view on the first three articles of the: \u201cNot the company with the best product wins, but the company that can adjust quickest to the users needs.\u201d I believe that it is far more important to be adaptive to the changing environment/needs than setting a constitution in stone and live by it. Particularly in the early phases of a project. After 4 years, learnings can be transferred to the Bedrock constitution. I would hope though, that the \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d character and the ability to adjust will continue to be an integral part of this Bedrock constitution. Token holders have sometimes a very short time horizon and the desire for \u201ctoken go up\u201d. I believe the separation of a Token House and a Citizens House enables balancing the short- and long-term interests of the protocol. Balancing power seems to be the ultimate goal. However, a future challenge might be to not sacrifice decision-making and its speed in an effort to balance out interests.

I have read and understood that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment: Yes. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: Hi Optimism Community! We are excited to begin supporting Optimism at our fullest capacity, offering a unique delegate experience for the community and stakeholders. As a user and supporter of Optimism since its launch, we are committed to helping the protocol\u2019s decentralization and multi-chain growth. Specifically, our focus will be on:  Researching and putting forward proposals to address potential areas of improvement such as governance participation, governance processes, growth, grants, etc. Providing input and recommendations regarding the size and distribution of OP funding across the Optimism ecosystem. As well as ensuring our votes are targeted towards protocols that truly align with the Optimistic Vision. Streaming important votes and proposals and their impact across our institutional and corporate channels.  At Wintermute, we believe that a decentralized world needs robust and progressive governance systems. Our goal is to support DAOs along their journey towards such a state through objective, long-term value-add decision-making. Our Core Values: Long-term value creation over short-term opportunism. For example, we do not support short-term rent-seeking token distribution programs; or the redistribution of tokens that carry no positive second-order effects. In contrast, we do support and encourage purpose-driven mechanisms that incentivize positive behaviour and are value-maximizing; or that improve alignment between token holders and the protocol. Transparency, alignment, and proactivity. We are proactive in providing clear and consistent reasoning behind our decision-making and proposals, ensuring the protocol\u2019s sustainability is at the heart of all governance discussions. Objective data-driven decision-making. We use data and research to ensure our final decision is objectively value-accretive for the protocol. By becoming a delegate we hope to support Optimism and have an impact on its transition to a robust and decentralized public good. My view on the Optimistic Vision: The Optimistic Vision outlines a truly transformative vision of public good funding that is highly transparent and accountable in contrast to traditional practices. The large retroactive incentive scheme ultimately redefines not only the public good landscape but also the demographic of contributors which have been traditionally cornered to private sectors. We believe the Optimistic Vision aligns social and private benefits/costs at a scale never seen before. Ultimately, creating a highly inclusive and impactful public goods commonplace. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: We believe that for a decentralized governance system to succeed it must be robust and progressive. Both these properties come from innovation, adaptation and improvements based on trials, tribulations, and experiments; a clear testament to a working constitution. A bicameral governance system is an exciting angle taken towards tackling systemic governance issues such as misalignment, pseudo-governance and voter apathy. Given a strong incentive system, ensuring a balance of voting power derived from financial and merit-based systems is extremely important. Furthermore, we believe having some sort of a central figure whether that be an individual or the Optimism foundation is important for a DAO to retain a sufficient level of operational efficiency, especially in its infancy.

My view on the [Optimistic Vision]: Great stuff, up until the part about impact=profit \u2014 \u201cthe principle that positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.\u201d As Lord Masternode Operator V would say, sounds a bit platitude-y. Would be very curious to learn about OC\u2019s vision of material utility (atoms) and social utility. But yeahm, obv, OV is yum, else wouldn\u2019t be applying c\u2019mon. My view on the first three articles of the [Working Constitution]: (1) Big fan of the \u201cworking\u201d part of the \u201cworking constitution\u201d but no constitution for a global cyberspace governance body can be legitimate if it\u2019s encoded in highly ideological Anglish. So, great that this is meant to work for four years, but big yikes about plans to create a Permanent Bedrock Constitution afterwards. Why yikes? See (2) The idea of \u201cstructural\u201d bicameralism and formal equality between OP Citizens and OP Holders is a worthy ideal, but it is not clear how OC would achieve that ideal. As an OP citizen-holder-person I have no idea what my citizenship rights are within OC.  I know I\u2019m not alone. The idea of representative delegated governance as an off-the-shelf \u201cstructural\u201d solution comes across as too technocratic, and kinda in tension with the Optimism Vision. Furthermore (3) \u201cThe Optimism Foundation is a Cayman Islands organization responsible for guiding the growth and development of the Optimism Collective.\u201d \u2013 nah, that\u2019s classic inversebrah: it\u2019s the Optimism Collective that guides its own growth and development.

The pursuit of growth and innovation is a timeless human endeavor, and as technology continues to evolve, new opportunities arise for us to shape the world around us. The advent of decentralized finance has brought about a new paradigm for governance, where power is distributed among a community of individuals rather than being centralized in a single entity. As a potential delegate in Optimism\u2019s governance, we have the opportunity to participate in this new era of decentralized decision making and play an active role in shaping the future of this exciting ecosystem. By contributing our unique skills and perspective, we aim to help drive positive change and advance the goals of the community. To make the most impact in Optimism\u2019s governance, it\u2019s important to approach our role as a delegate with a philosophical mindset. We are here to engage in open and honest dialogue, collaborate with others, and put the interests of the community above our own. By doing this, we can not only help create a more robust and resilient ecosystem, but also be part of a movement that is changing the world for the better. Ultimately, being a delegate is about more than just making decisions - it\u2019s about being part of a larger movement to create a more equitable and sustainable future for us all. By contributing our time, expertise, and creativity, we can be a part of this exciting chapter in human history.  Views on the Optimistic Vision 154: DAOstewards is optimistic, why\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe The vision statement presented by the Optimism Collective is truly inspiring and presents a hopeful future for the world of digital governance. The idea that the Collective could provide incentives for positive impact in a decentralized ecosystem is both innovative and practical. The emphasis on the principle of impact=profit aligns individual interests with the greater good and creates a virtuous cycle of growth and expansion. The concept of the Collective expanding beyond the digital realm and into the physical world is both ambitious and exciting. It\u2019s clear that the Optimism Collective is not only driving towards a more productive and empathetic economy, but also towards a more cooperative and compassionate world. With its focus on the creation of public goods and its commitment to growth and expansion, the Optimism Collective has the potential to revolutionize the way we organize in the digital age and beyond. Aren\u2019t you Optimistic, Frens?!  Views on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Article 1 - we are at the frontier of coordination; nothing is cast in stone! The Constitution starts humbly, and we love it. The concept of a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution for web3 is a game-changer for the future of decentralized governance. This approach to constitution-building is rooted in humility and recognizes the complexity of the problem space. Rather than starting with a fixed model of governance, the Working Constitution is a commitment to experimentation and learning, which will allow the Collective to define itself, evolve, and grow iteratively over time. With a Working Constitution, the Collective can test and refine different governance models and see what works best in practice. This approach allows the Collective to be nimble and responsive to changing circumstances and ensures that the governance structure remains relevant and effective. In contrast, a fully developed, static constitution runs the risk of becoming obsolete and irrelevant as the world and the Collective evolve. A Working Constitution allows for a more organic and adaptive governance structure that can continue to serve the Collective for generations to come. So why settle for a static constitution when you can have a Working Constitution that is constantly learning and evolving to meet the needs of the Collective? After all, web3 is about building the future and it\u2019s only fitting that our governance structure should be as dynamic and forward-thinking as the technology itself!  Article 2 - equitably governing this decentralized community, while promoting transparency and accountability in decision making - Bicameral is the way to go! Bad actors are attracted to incentives just like flies are attracted to honey!, it\u2019s a given. In a highly decentralized community, developing mechanisms to balance power and instill checks and balances will ensure a sustainable community. The bicameral approach adopted ensures this if it\u2019s implemented well. Article 3 - while we don\u2019t subscribe to a single entity having excessive control over the governance of the community, we understand the need for it at the early stages and are more optimistic when there\u2019s a clear pathway towards gradually democratizing the power of the foundation. \ud83e\udef1\ud83c\udffe\u200d\ud83e\udef2\ud83c\udfff Web3 interests: Governance, Accessibility, Social impact, Economics, Writing Languages I speak and write: English skills and areas of expertise: Strategic thinking, PM, OPs, strategy, Content, Coordination favorite Web3 projects: BanklessDAO, Optimism, Ethereum ",

So, I\u2019m prepared to make a commitment. My reasons for wanting to be a delegate: My first felling is that I want to help. I want to help public goods succeed and achieve collective fair coordination and decentralization. I have spent time participating in DAOs and seen that coordination, transparency and decentralization are keys to success in governance. My view on the Optimistic Vision: I think it\u2019s a novel vision and represents a massive step in Ethereum\u2019s commitment to public goods and not abandoning the MVV (mission, vision and values). My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: 1 1. Agree with the first point. A governance model that can be used as an industry standard has not yet emerged. So we need a dynamic governance body that can change with the tide. 2. Strongly agree. OP Citizens and OP Holders are mutually constrained to make governance balanced and dynamic, and OP Citizens makes governance more interesting to participate. 3. strongly agree. The existence of Optimism Foundation is an important part in the beginning of OP governance and can make OP more ready. As time goes by, the decentralized governance will become more mature and the Optimism Foundation\u2019s will become decentralized at that time.

My view on the Optimistic Vision :  I totally \u201cin the wave\u201d of Optimistic project. I do agree with the NorthSrat statement motivating the creation of a more productive and empathetic economy. The concepts of Governance minimization, anti-plutocracy, impact=profit concept are close to my understanding how DAO should be regulated. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:  I completely agree with the Working constitution statements. Governance minimisation, anti-plutocracy, impact=profit principle - these statements coincide with my view how Web3 community should grow and which principles should underly it as a basement. \u201cSustainable future for Ethereum\u201d, for sure, can be supported with projects like Optimism. Scalability, sustainability is provided with your new rewarding model impact=profit. I also like concepts of Citizens\u2019 House and Token House.

We are 404 DAO, a non-profit born out of Blockchain at Georgia Tech with the mission to provide web3 education and opportunities in Atlanta. Blockchain at GT is a student led blockchain organization at Georgia Tech and currently has over 40 active members. Blockchain at GT has four main committees: Governance, Non-Technical (primarily research), Technical (primarily Solidity development), and Macro (Encourage discussion at meetings and inform members on crypto news). The club also leads a Crypto 101 course for new members, hosts multiple social and speaker events each semester, and is an official partners for Web3 ATL, the largest web3 conference and hackathon in Atlanta. The 404 DAO team believes in the future of Ethereum and the importance of scalability in achieving mass adoption. Optimism is a core piece of infrastructure to make this vision a reality and we are honored to contribute. Through our diverse business and technical perspectives, we aim to further Optimism\u2019s impact by actively engaging in community discussions and participating in governance. We will leverage this experience to educate and empower the next generation of leaders through our partnership with Blockchain at GT. 404 DAO is committed to transparency; everything involved in our governance decisions will be recorded and displayed on this notion page. My view on the Optimistic Vision 158: The axiom of Impact = Profit strongly resonates with our team as we believe it is crucial for individuals to be properly rewarded for their contributions in order to align incentives. Over the last 7-8 months we have seen the Optimistic Collective governance model successfully drive rapid growth for the Optimism ecosystem. However moving into 2023, delegates and governance participants need to focus on turning this early growth into something sustainable for the long-term. It is the responsibility of The Collective to properly reward the individuals building public goods, tools, and applications in the Optimism ecosystem. As stated in the OP Vision, current cyberspace is plagued by the mistake of applying physical rulesets to a system that is not bound by the same constraints. We strongly agree that it is important to recognize the difference between traditional physical systems and digital systems. And while it is advantageous for the Collective to follow established best practices used in current democracies, it is crucial to recognize that new systems will open the door for new types of solutions. My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution As a team and organization we value an iterative governance process and believe it is the best path forward for the Collective. The web3 landscape is ever-changing, so our team views the Working Constitution as an optimal framework to guide the early stages of the Collective. While flexibility is key in the early stages of governance, we do believe it is important for the Bedrock constitution to be implemented in no more than 4 years. Additionally, we respect the need for the Optimism Foundation and are confident that it will act in the best interest of the Optimism ecosystem.
