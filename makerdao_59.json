By funnelling existing DAI investors back into a Maker-centric lending marketplace, Pairwyse can provide Maker:  a fixed rate facility to scale RWA and institutional vaults rapidly and sustainably freedom to apply as-dynamic-as-possible governance over DAI peg and supply a means to scale transaction volume and risk premiums in a DAI neutral manner a channel to funnel DAI holders back into Maker and away from competitors a stronger user network and loyalty through scalable peer-to-peer transactions   1626\u00d7922 202 KB  Pairwyse is already deployed on mainnet and requires no feature changes to the Maker protocol to create user value now. A front-end interface can be accessed at www.pairwyse.io to enable P2P borrower-lender deals. We believe a fixed-rate marketplace can readily solve the impossible trinity for Maker in a scalable manner. As such, we would like to seek the wider Maker community\u2019s feedback on Pairwyse and its utility towards scaling Maker. @SebVentures @Aes @williamr @Primoz @Nadia @PaperImperium @Tru_Greg @g_dip ",

We expect:  by the end of 2021 to have $2 million TVL assuming either Sushi LP or Uni V3 goes live on Maker soon - $10 million TVL by mid 2022 assuming Maker prices RWA prudently as spread + DSR then $100 million TVL and scaling from there to the billions  Regarding regulation: We have had compliance analysis done by multiple top-tier US lawyers. Different ones have given different answers. The main distinction is if this will be treated as A. placement or B. swaps If B. Then its important how we are decentralized and that changes the landscape. We take inspiration from Maker in the decentralized management of the org and deployments. If A. There are a number of things  An Argentinian lawyer concluded with us that we can sell this in Argentina without license or registration. It is likely similar in other parts of Latin America In the US there may be some exemptions to take advantage of. For example: Reg D, the 270 day short term debt exemption, or the MBS exemption. We have strong relationships with a number of regulated investment banks who are happy to partner with us on issuance.  ",

I am convinced that this will need a lot of cases to integrate into Maker model. Also, while it\u2019s popular to mention impossible trinity around Maker, the truth is Maker system solves impossible trinity by sacrificing \u201cindependent monetary policy\u201d as Dai minted in the Maker system has to be backed by collateral. On the other hand, countries\u2019 currencies are unbacked and in case where for weak economies with low foreign reserve (collateral in a sesne), they face an extreme unpeg pressure. For algo stablecoins that can mint without collateral, they have such flexibility but Maker doesn\u2019t. ",

Who do you envision to the be the Dai investor in this scenario? Is it an independent investor seeking a fixed rate of return? If the borrower draws money at a low rate from Maker, does the Dai investor receive the same rate? Is it possible for the Dai investor to receive a fixed rate but at a higher rate of return?

It is an investor who wants not only a fixed rate but wants added protections to mitigate credit risk. Since MakerDAO is the counter-party on all DAI, this allows us to use Maker as a counter-party for these lenders as well. This is one unique feature that distinguishes us from some of the other fixed-rate platforms (but not all). The only way for the rate to be higher is if: 1. They take a subordinated position. or 2. Yield Farming. We do not plan on being an issuer of a yield farm. Excited to hear more about your new position sometime! Regards ",

                    "content": "Hi Doo_Nam, I am unsure about this. Will be good to discuss, as this is my understanding:  The collateral backing that is required in the Maker system is simply for the purposes of managing credit risk when loans are made, which leads to an increase of DAI. The collateral backing in Maker can not be compared to the gold standard, which was the case in central banking, where all major countries linked the value of their currency to a specified amount of gold. In central banking, the gold standard was used to remove the free flow of capital point, which meant gold became the \u201cmedium of exchange\u201d and \u201cunit of account\u201d  to \u201cprice money\u201d between different economies. Right now currencies like USD have a free flow of capital model, which means fx rates are volatile, and driven by the supply/demand of the money supply, and this is managed through interest rates. As such, money is now \u201cpriced based on rates\u201d, as high rates drive influx of deposits and low rates drive outflow, which means supply and demand can be controlled through the rates i.e. my point above of pricing money. So we can choose to maintain free flow of capital, where it\u2019s easy for money to go in and out of an economy, but we can also control a peg to another currency by managing the supply/demand of the money through tweaking the floating rates. So if you have to peg DAI to usd, you can\u2019t just add collateral or remove collateral from thin air in the Maker system, the users need to be incentivised to deposit and withdraw the collateral. The collateral is simply a tool to enable the transaction and is not the factor that incentivises the transaction. This incentive is based on interest rates, and this is the true \u201cprice of DAI\u201d, and the collateral is simply a way to manage the credit risk of the borrowers. As such, the collateral is not the basis with which you price the money supply, and thus is not like the gold standard. As such, the Maker system does not simply remove the free flow of capital point, if anything Maker has adopted the modern central banking approach of tweaking/managing rates to manage the supply/demand, but as it can\u2019t trust the borrower\u2019s credit ratings, as a central bank can with a commercial banks, the Maker systems demands collateral.  This is my thinking, but would be good to gain your view. ",
