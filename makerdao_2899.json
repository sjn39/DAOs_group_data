Welcome to another collateral onboarding call. We\u2019re joined by a bunch of people interested in Maker in general and real-world assets in particular. We are with Budd White, who\u2019s going to give us more of an insight and overview about the project. But before that, I want to give the floor to S\u00e9bastien Derivaux, who\u2019s going to comment on the progress of the Real-World Assets Working Group. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.   Collateral Paperchain [PC-DROP]  [PC-DROP] MIP6 Application: Paperchain DROP: Tokenized Music Streaming Invoices  Budd White Presentation 02:49 1920\u00d71080 92 KB 1920\u00d71080 204 KB 1920\u00d71080 116 KB 1920\u00d71080 133 KB 1920\u00d71080 112 KB 1920\u00d71080 168 KB 17:46 - Can you do this as well with affiliate marketing platforms? 1920\u00d71080 136 KB 22:41 - Do you pool the loans of the different borrowers together or do you have them completely separated? How do you manage the risk on that side? 1920\u00d71080 193 KB 1920\u00d71080 136 KB 44:02 - The revolving means that, as the pool is getting paid, you will issue more debt based on that same pool. Is that right? 1920\u00d71080 102 KB Discussion  29:27 - Wouldn\u2019t this be easier if you just become an invoice refactoring service for Spotify, so you just get money from the discount rate? 31:25 - How often have you seen or would expect to see the data be different, have the data be subsequently modified? Somebody listened to a song 50,000 times, but it was actually 5,000 times \u2014 or the reverse. 32:23 - What is the gross dollar amount impact that you expect, even on a percentage basis? Out of the total amount of the net portfolio, 2% sometimes is dodgy. 35:15 - As a company, are you diversifying, are you going to target independent artists and quite possibly help the movement of decentralizing some of these platforms, some of these venues? Also, what has happened since that article that was published by Centrifuge and Maker on October 29th [2019]? What has happened in the last 12 months? 46:15 - Let\u2019s hypotetically say that Maker was able to give you a 10 million Dai facility at whatever risk parameters you want to do. What could you deploy tomorrow? 47:34 - If you had to give a timeline estimate to where you could routinely revolve eight figures, what would you say? 49:40 - Can you go over and try to explain to us how exactly the bridge works between Centrifuge and getting to Dai, to Ethereum? 53:52 - What\u2019s the worst thing that could potentially happen to a pool? Are there any mitigation plans for that?  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 57:28  Budd, thanks for coming. It was great having you. I\u2019m looking forward to see how these things evolve. Where can people find you and Paperchain?   Credits   @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers.  ",

Today we are here joined by Denis, Victor and Jure from Blocksquare. They\u2019re going to explain their project and hopefully we can have an open conversation and ask questions, interrupt a lot and they can tell us more about the project.

How would you liquidate these assets on-chain given the transfer restrictions and demonstrate that there will actually be liquidity in the event that the asset is liquidated? 30:36 - When you were mentioning that the company signs a corporate resolution, in effect you\u2019re basically tokenizing a revenue participation agreement, which I think is quite novel. The question I have, though, is: how is that actually implemented in the context of \u2013 whoever is paying that revenue, where is the crossover point where you\u2019re going from fiat into a token? How is that managed? 33:01 - We would prefer to have on-chain liquidations in Maker, but other implementations are actually using option liquidations as well because we just can\u2019t find a way to make them on-chain because of all these constraints that you mentioned. With the property token that you issue, I\u2019m not really sure if even option liquidations are truly possible. 38:06 - Even if things go right, when someone \u2014Maker or someone else\u2014 gets these tokens, do you know what future returns to expect or it\u2019s more like I\u2019m buying Tesla and I hope it goes up compared to\u2026? 41:00 - Right now, when we issue a loan in Dai, we put a fee which is equivalent to the interest rate, but I\u2019m guessing that in this case that would not be the case, that you would be sharing any potential revenues but they would not be determined by what we call the stability fee 43:45 - With regards to restrictive tokens, is it possible to do an ERC1404? I would imagine yes, so: assuming I\u2019m a commercial property owner, I have a mixed-use property and I want to raise some money to fix the building, I guess I could go generate some register securities as tokens, use your platform to get these tokens and then give them out to the people who want to invest. And then I could put some restrictions on it with something like an ERC 1404  Closing Comment Juan Guill\u00e9n Outro 47:19   Seb wants to give us an update on the RWA working group.
