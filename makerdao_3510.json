The famous question,  attributed to Henry Kissinger,  \"WHO DO I CALL, IF I WANT TO CALL EUROPE? \" raises a problem I don\u2019t see clear about MakerDao - and DAOs in general. Europe is still very much seen as a continent of cooperating countries, not as a single EU bloc of 27 member states, where everyone has their own point of view.  This line-up looks very similar to me a organization like MakerDAO where the Core Units responsible for operations are in a juxtaposed relationship with each other, and governance is by vote of a very broad, worldwide shareholder base (although not so broad at the moment, but not relevant here), it raises general questions for me. This kind of governance with the active involvement of the foundation was perfectly adequate in \u2018peacetime\u2019, but now things have accelerated, which is both good and worrying for me. A bit I see MakerDAO growing more and more, and nowadays start to looks like a tanker: big and heavy, therefore slow and difficult to turn (and of course, very valuable  ) and the channel of good decisions on which we sail, is very narrow .   I think the difficulty in quick responding is caused by differences in language, education, social, legal, technical and other skills of the MKR owners who add their votes to operate the system. What other difficulties -and solutions- do you see in this area?   The more valuable the system becomes, the more people will try to attack it and immediate response will be vital. OK, suppose we can shut down the system if there\u2019s a serious attack. But what if, every week, there are serious attacks on the system just because it\u2019s so valuable that it\u2019s worth it.  We cannot shut down the system every week\u2026 or can we?   I have more questions, but I don\u2019t want to write much. If a discussion on this topic unfolds here, I\u2019ll post it later. ",

But I\u2019d like to piggyback a related question about who \u2013 operationally \u2013 is tying together the different units. For example, today I was on a call with several folks at a bank. First, let\u2019s just appreciate that the MakerDAO name is so respected that I \u2013 some guy without even a MakerDAO email address \u2013 can get three decision-makers at a crypto-oriented bank to sit down on a call with just an email. We need to protect that kind of brand name and importance in the crypto ecosystem. Secondly, we were brainstorming collaborations and they ranged very widely. Aside from the obvious talk about vaults (hello, Growth CU!), there was also some pontificating and discussion about our oracle network (hello, Oracle CU!), and a very lengthy discussion about how to integrate our governance activities into their platform to increase participation (hello, Governance CU!) since MKR holders can already vote on-chain through this bank\u2019s custodial platform. I\u2019ve had a few other calls this week that were originally about pushing vaults or accepting DAI that meandered across these different DAO mandates. I think it will be difficult for our hardworking staff in various CU\u2019s to avoid missing what could be great opportunities that come up by happenstance. I don\u2019t know how to square that circle. But it made me really appreciate that there are a lot of different ways that institutions and businesses are open to being involved with the DAO, but the question I got in every meeting was \u201cWho do I talk to if I want to proceed with X a month from now?\u201d ",

For press inquiries, I believe David U put something together, but generally funneling interested individuals into the forums with a list of optimal contacts (say, if you want Oracles, talk to X; if you want Smart Contract consulting, talk to Y) could be the way to go. The important point is to ensure that people look to the DAO and not the Foundation (which is dissolving) for communications and touchpoints. Thankfully, the Foundation seems to have embraced dissolution and becomes quieter by the day, which should cut any final \u201cdependencies\u201d from our (the DAO\u2019s) perspective. Tosh ",

Should someone ask you from outside say a tradFi bank:  \u201cwho do I talk to if I need to borrow XX amount for my business?\u201d \u201cwho should I talk to if I have a plan to securitise XX amount of debt?\u201d \u201cwho should I talk to if I plan to pitch an idea to the bank\u2019s venture lab?\u201d \u2026  It could go on and on. For all of those questions, it would be a completely different answer. If you wanted business lending, it would point you to business lending, for securitisation the structured finance team and so. In that sense, MakerDAO is not really different. The core difference is that  for once all sc are opensource so you see what\u2019s going on and you need to understand your use case better: are we talking RWAs, are we talking crypto-native, are we talking oracle services etc.  The other core difference is the required coordination between teams, say RWAs required a bunch of coordination between the RWA team, oracles, smart contracts and external parties (Centrifuge or LendCo). But that is on the implementation side. So you would still have similar coordination hurdles to overcome in a tradFi bank, it\u2019s just that as a customer you don\u2019t see it happening, whereas at Maker stuff is open so discussions/coordination happen in open/public forums.

As we saw with Black Thursday, a rapid response is vital in such an event - or at least can prevent a lot of damage. Black Thursday will not happen again in the same form, but as the system becomes more complex, there will be more and more potential for security flaws. ",
