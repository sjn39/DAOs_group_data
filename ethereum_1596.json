This applies to the creation of a composable/graph NFT. In this standard, the ERC-721 Token is a first class citizen and can freely compose with other Tokens. The result is get an interesting NFT with a graph structure.  Motivation The ability to compose opens up many more possibilities for ERC-721, here are some possible scenarios:  assets owned by an address can be transformed into assets owned by an NFT. Linking an avatar NFT to an ENS an avatar/game character composed from different NFTs a number of assets packaged with an NFT and sold together, etc.  ERC-998 attempts to solve this problem, but ERC-998 introduces more complexity to the composability, and the main advantages of the standard over ERC-998 are:  there is no top-down/bottom-up concept the function names are closer to those of the regular operations graph structure (link/updateTarget/unlink), which makes the standard easier to understand the function names are sufficiently uniform when dealing with different Tokens (linkERCx/updateERCxTarget/unlinkERCx) easy to extend  Links: PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4786 Reference implementation: https://github.com/poria-cat/ERC-4786  ",
