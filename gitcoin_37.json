I know we\u2019re all consuming diverse information about how to build DAOs, and I\u2019d love to invite you all to post what you\u2019re learning on this thread.  The result will hopefully be a compilation of useful information which can serve as a basis for sensemaking about things to try (or avoid) at GitcoinDAO. If you have seen a great DAO design resource, please post it below. ",

The are also key to the crash-response plan at our biggest airports where seconds can make a life or death difference to people.  I wonder if GC has one?  If not\u2026 I think you figured out how to participate!  Build Gitcoin\u2019s IRP!  Have you any experience in this area and would you be willing to try?  I\u2019m sure you will find supportive folks happy to help, plus, in creating our IRP draft you will get exposed to some of the deeper crevices of the Gitcoin Dao rabbit hole and gain familiarity. Gitcoin Dao is quite good at recognizing participation.  Unlike traditional employment where your supervisor gives you a task things are occasionally inverted here.  In some daos you choose a task that you believe adds value to the dao, then go show people who seem to care (no real supervisors anymore, we try to use councils in the GCFDD).  If value is created or added it is highly likely you will be rewarded well, and possibly offered greater responsibilities. ",
