                    "content": "Overview MakerDAO, as a protocol, could benefit from transferring some of its risk off-balance sheet using a tailored policy with Nexus Mutual. This would have the following key benefits:  Create a buffer that reduces the level of MKR minting should the system accrue debt. Allow more collateral types to be on-boarded, as downside risk of collateral failure is dampened. Provide buffer funds in an Emergency Shutdown situation giving greater confidence that DAI holders can be made whole.  An outline of the proposal is as follows: Fundamentals  Who does the cover protect?  The protocol itself, rather than individual vault owners MKR holders DAI users indirectly, by making the overall protocol more resilient.   What are the main underlying risks?  Collateral Failure Oracle Failure Liquidations being sold below market value Risk management processes failing   How do the risks manifest themselves?  DAI debt leading to minting and auctioning MKR Implementation of Emergency Shutdown DAI dropping below the peg   Goals:  Simple claim payout trigger Covers all the main risks keeps interests aligned with MKR holders pricing is reasonable    Suggested Product The following product assumes that nearly all material risks manifest themselves through either MakerDAO accruing debt or the Emergency Shutdown being implemented.  Cover is only valid if purchased by MakerDAO (not regular crypto users) Cover is bought in lots (lot size TBA but might be 3,000,000 DAI) Cover is paid for in DAI and claim payments are made in DAI Nexus Mutual can currently offer a maximum of 32,485 ETH worth of cover in total, roughly $12m at an ETH price of $370. This will expand as Nexus Mutual grows and further cover can be bought in the future if desired.  Claims Triggers A) If DAI debt goes above a threshold, eg 5,000,000 DAI, then a claim from one lot will be paid, eg 3,000,000. This continues for each 5m tranche, for example if DAI debt goes above 10,000,000 DAI then 2 lots will be paid, 6,000,000 DAI in total. Note: Claims are only paid for each threshold being breached once within any monthly(?) period. This gives time so that MKR auctions get cleared and bring the debt position back to zero. I believe the right metric to track is \u201cDebt Available to Heal\u201d here https://daistats.com/#/ B) If Emergency Shutdown is enacted claims on all lots will be paid. Any planned Emergency Shutdowns for the purposes of upgrading the Maker Protocol are specifically excluded. Payments could be sent to the DAI debt pool (where auctions are conducted from), on the assumption that the DAI would directly reduces the need to hold some MKR auctions. Would need to be confirmed if this makes sense technically. Pricing Pricing needs to be determined by Nexus Mutual stakers after the product has been finalised.

Interesting idea though, would love to hear estimates as to the pricing.     yaronvel:  The the expected profit from insurance is always negative   I feel like this is true, and probably a key point. Unless the insurance can cover an event that would otherwise lead to the collapse of the protocol, I\u2019m not sure whether it would be worthwhile. Assuming that we\u2019re pricing risk correctly, we should have positive EV. I\u2019m also not sure if this is good for the protocol itself. Part of the game theory supporting the protocol is that if MKR holders make bad decisions, new MKR is printed which leads to a wider distribution of the token, bringing in new token holders to govern the protocol (hopefully more effectively). If insurance prevents bad decisions resulting in MKR mints, the same people will be making (bad?) decisions in the future. ",

Recapitalization is also likely to be needed when overall market sentiment is low. Basically the system is set up to buy high and sell low.  Over time this could lead to excessive dilution of MKR holders and make MKR a less valuable asset, which diminishes its value as a system backstop. I\u2019m wondering how the mint/burn mechanics could be set up counter cyclically to avoid minting MKR at low prices?  My first i\u2026         System Reserves Risk       Given the current low SF, it will take a long time for a substantial surplus to build up just from operating cashflow. I know that the idea of \u201cpre-printing\u201d MKR was brought up on the call last week, and while I would be supportive of issuing capital to build up the surplus buffer, we could potentially issue other types of capital instead of just equity.  Traditional banks often issue financial instruments called contingent convertible bonds as a supplemental source of reserves in addition to co\u2026     Completely agree with @LongForWisdom that ultimately, whether this is a good idea for MKR holders depends on the cost of capital/coverage. But, I think it could be worth pursuing on a small scale even if the cost isn\u2019t great initially - MakerDAO could potentially help nexus reach economies of scale with specialized risk transfer products.

I think Nexus Mutual will sell tailored policies with MakerDAO as beneficiary, and the buyer won\u2019t be MakerDAO. Most likely, Nexus Mutual would offer a price MakerDAO would not choose to pay. The exception would be if both sides had wildly divergent risk assessments. MakerDAO already has insurance against bad debt, so only a positive expected value would make buying a cover  policy potentially worthwhile (a large one to be worth the bother). A more likely customer for this policy is a collateral on-boarding applicant. The applicant\u2019s goal is to get on-boarded, and under optimal terms. An applicant may want to improve its chance of getting on-boarded by including a Nexus Mutual policy cover benefiting MakerDAO (even if they agree that the policy itself has a negative expected value). I suggest contacting the interested parties of collateral applications.  An applicant could place the policy fee in escrow, so that the policy is purchased (with MakerDAO as beneficiary) upon successful on-boarding, otherwise returned after some period of time.  Then, the applicant can update the application to reflect their improved risk profile. This could potentially make some applications so much more attractive to MakerDAO that including a policy cover becomes the standard.  A loose analogy might be including a major appliance home warranty policy with the sale of a house. ",

Maybe individuals put up 40% of the capital and Nexus Mutual puts up the other 60%. This spreads the risk amongst a larger pool of capital thereby lowering the cost of insurance. Every 30 days the policy is renewed and if there is no risk, then they receive their principal plus premiums. If there is a risk past a certain threshold, then the equity is the first to absorb the losses and Nexus Mutual pays the remainder. Ideally, this would be done on-chain in an automatic way. Having a safety net in place could enable MakerDAO to scale much faster and generate more revenue. Also, it lowers people\u2019s aversion to getting the rug pulled out from under.

However, as already pointed out here, in MakerDAO\u2019s case this would be mostly beneficial for hedging against catastrophic failures which Nexus Mutual can not handle currently. Otherwise it is mostly about pricing risks. If MakerDAO is overestimating risks, then it makes sense to buy cheaper Nexus Mutual covers and retain a higher margin. I currently see two issues when assessing this though. As much as I know, Nexus members vote on actual compensation when it comes to events triggering it. How would Maker assess probability of actual payout based on this and based on sufficient capital held at Nexus in times of distress? In that sense the price paid for insurance isn\u2019t necessarily representing full insurance even if conditions for triggering it are very clear. Also, how can Nexus properly price MakerDAO risks if risk profile changes every time new collateral is onboarded or risk parameters are adjusted? I guess this isn\u2019t something to worry on our end, but still maybe Nexus isn\u2019t aware of this potential issue. ",

Most fast growing tech companies assume ~10% discount, and Makerdao cover cost is ~5.2% APY, so I believe this potentially could be a sound financial decision to offload some of the risk to Nexus.

Different investors have different risk profiles. If the MKR holders can offload the parts of the risk profile that they are not comfortable pricing, even if it\u2019s at a net loss in the long run, they \u201cwin\u201d via the certainty they get. While certainty can be intangible, it should be beneficial as the DAO grows. For instance, if the DAO is already taking a significant amount of default risk on a specific asset, and an insurance policy allows it to \u201clock in\u201d a return on that asset, loan growth can happen at a higher pace than if the underwriting risk is unknown and constantly has to be repriced. Otherwise I agree with most of your sentiment. At this scale, there will be a loser by the end of the policy. But if Nexus can grow its risk distribution business and MakerDAO continues to grow Dai distribution, both companies can help each other reach scale via specialization. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the comments everyone. It seems like there are three main items to expand on further at this stage. 1) Would MakerDAO benefit from cover, 2) Pricing, 3) Claims determination 1. Is this beneficial to MakerDAO? Obviously not my call to make, I\u2019d just like to raise one main point and that is the negative reflexive nature of Makers mint/burn approach. MKR minting/burning is basically designed to buy low and sell high. And while mcap is $0.5bn, that is a very long way from the debt that the protocol could handle in one go. If there was any significant debt accrued, then mcap would likely drop materially, and then more MKR are minted and more sell pressure is placed in the market. To be clear, I\u2019m not being critical of the current model as I can\u2019t see any other alternatives, I\u2019m just pointing out that even $12m at a point where there is material debt will significantly dampen the impact. This is about giving MakerDAO cash at a time of need. So while that appears to have negative EV on the surface, it is very likely to have positive EV if you consider the perspective of how much MKR is avoided being minted vs the cost of MKR not being burned by purchasing the cover. Cover is purchased using a high MKR price and MKR minting at a low price is avoided. 2. Pricing Nexus Mutual currently has a minimum price of 5.2% pa, which was increased recently. There is some discussion about lowering this price again, as it was increased in response to SAFE mining which has now ended. While I can\u2019t guarantee anything, I think it\u2019s reasonably likely that there is sufficient staking interest and the price is at or close to the minimum. Pricing moves with staking, but not for existing purchases. So if you bought a years worth of cover the price may be different if you wish to renew but it wouldn\u2019t change for that year. One main reason I suggested the structure I did, effectively paying 60% of the debt (up to limits), is to ensure there still remains an alignment of interest between MakerDAO risk management and Nexus. If Nexus covered all downside that could cause issues on both sides. 3. Claims Assessment Nexus Mutual operates as a discretionary mutual, this means all claims are at the discretion of members. There is also no specific legal recourse here like there would be for regulated insurance products. Apart from the claims assessment staking mechanisms designed to prevent fradulent and/or malicious voting Nexus Mutual\u2019s key objective in all it\u2019s incentive structures is to encourage the payment of genuine claims. If Nexus members decline genuine claims there is no reason for Nexus to exist, paying claims is actually in the long term interest of the mutual. I\u2019m happy to attend a governance call or provide further info as required. Assuming there is interest in pursuing further it would be great to discuss with a few experts on your side to get into more details, but please guide me here as I\u2019m not in the weeds of MakerDAO governance processes.

Hugh_Karp:  If the MakerDAO community wishes to progress then the next steps would be   Figuring out this part is the tough bit! There is a brief overview of MakerDAO\u2019s governance processes here: MakerDAO Standard Governance Processes. In my opinion the best way to move forward would be to great a Declaration of Intent. Stating something like the following: \u201cMaker Governance wishes to engage nexus mutual to provide insurance for the Maker Protocol.\u201d This declaration could include as much detail as you wanted to provide at this stage (given that it is uncertain whether the Declaration would pass). Here\u2019s two examples of what these look like for reference:  MIP13c3-SP2: Declaration of Intent - Dai Flash Mint Module MIP13c3-SP1: Declaration of Intent: (Forward Guidance)  This would help confirm that Maker Governance wanted to pursue this. The details (payment, terms, etc) would then be written up in a full MIP and submitted to governance for confirmation. The question is whether you want to engage with our governance processes yourself @Hugh_Karp or whether there is a community member (Either from Maker or from Nexus Mutual) that wants to help champion the proposal. Myself or @charlesstlouis are happy to help with the structure and process around creating a Declaration of Intent, and later a full MIP.     Hugh_Karp:  I\u2019m happy to proceed with #1, as there appears to be sufficient interest to warrant next steps.   I would note that it\u2019s somewhat risky to assume that community interest equates to MKR Holder interest. It\u2019s great that the community is interested and it\u2019s a positive sign, but the community and MKR Holders are not a 1:1 group. The Declaration of Intent process was designed to confirm MKR Holder interest. ",

Thank you for the response Hugh. It would be interesting to know if the Maker Community members (including MKR Holders), would be interested in Staking NXM for the sake of MKR. If I understand correctly, I as an MKR holder would need to Stake NXM in the MakerDAO Protocol cover, correct? If we can motivate\u2013say 70% of that MakerDAO Nexus Mutual Cover to be sponsor/staked by MKR Holders\u2013then we could get a lower rate per annum? Is that right\u2013or, MKR Holders would need to be majority owners of NXM tokens within the Nexus Mutual protocol, and vote on quoting MakerDAO a low rate Per Annum?

After (maximum benefit / annual premium) years insurance is a losing proposition (that\u2019s a cap). As @g_dip said, it\u2019s just math. First, it is needed that MKR holder want to have those reserves. Then come the issue on the kind of reserve. DAI is great but pressure the peg, ETH is risky but can have an increasing value, farming opportunities can have a yield but also a risk. Nothing too hard, but this a something to work on. Then, we might want to have a full protection from day 1 (for instance 5M DAI protection). We might want to save let\u2019s say 1M each year in strategic reserves and pay a premium to cover the risk (a notional of 4,5M the first year, 3.5M the second year, \u2026). It\u2019s quite similar to a whole life insurance which is more or less a saving product with a term insurance. We should also check if our risks are linked to Nexus Mutual or not. For instance, the DeFi bubble popping can be harmful for Maker and Nexus at the same time. I haven\u2019t looked at Nexus too much yet. ",

This was one question I wanted to ask @Hugh_Karp on the Gov & Risk meeting. On a recent Podcast (Delphi Digital) I heard a Guest comment that Nexus Mutual would only be able to cover approximately $65M of the TVL in DeFi. To be fair this observation was made by the \u201cguest\u201d in August, 2020. I can imagine now, Nexus Mutual can cover more. Hugh, in another Black Swan event\u2013how much of DeFi can Nexus Mutual cover? If possible, can you please give an opinion on how that would breakdown. When possible, no rush.

Nexus puts caps on individual risks to make sure we have enough money to pay all claims (diversification of risk in a similar way that Maker chooses many assets for collateral). The $65M was referring to how much Nexus could cover in total across all risks. That number has grown a lot and is in the order of $300M right now. Due to the caps per risk, Nexus can handle up to 5 large protocols completely failing at once before it runs out of funds. Nexus Mutual\u2019s Current Assets = $70m Cap per Risk = $12m Maximum Cover Across all risks = ~$300m Just like regular insurance companies Nexus aims to be geared, meaning total cover is much greater than total assets.

                    "content": "I would advocate for 3 distinct buckets as insurance. The first should be self-insurance (i.e. equity tranche) via a strategic reserve which I think should be wBTC since it is highly liquid, it is less volatile than other digital assets, and it is gaining capital inflows from publicly traded companies. The second should be a liquidity pool (i.e. mezzanine tranche) of DAI that is staked for 30 days for a fixed premium in the event that there are no losses. If losses past a certain point materialize, then they lose their principal and interest. The third should be Nexus cover (i.e. senior-secured tranche) which acts as a kind of reinsurance product. Taken together you have diversified your smart-contract risk amongst wBTC, DAI, and NXM shareholders and provided them with a small return for hedging your exposure to a black swan event (e.g. Black Thursday). Obviously, this should be done in conjunction with proper risk management. I think it would give people peace of mind similar to the way FDIC insurance alleviates some customer\u2019s reservations about bank failure. ",
