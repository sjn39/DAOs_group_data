(Based on @Mariano_Conti 's input)   Cons Technical changes have a higher degree of importance, than monetary policy changes. They either:  Fix exploits or technical weaknesses. This class of changes is vital to pass as quickly as possible. Change the functioning of the system. This class of changes is extremely important, and requires a high degree of consideration before passing.  Neither of these changes should be wrapped up with monetary policy changes. When this happens, you either:  Risk delaying essential technical fixes due to bundling with undesirable monetary policy changes. Risk passing functional changes to the system without due consideration due to desirable monetary policy changes. Or vice versa, with positive monetary policy changes being blocked by undesirable technical changes.      No, we should not bundle technical changes with monetary policy changes.

No. In retrospect I should have added a poll option for \u2018only in emergencies.\u2019 Also thanks for explaining your reasoning, @Mariano_Conti. Would love to see more of that from all sides. ",

Adding any new executive splits the MKR and increases the security risk, but we still do them. Furthermore, we do them on a fixed schedule, meaning that an attacker can wait until a new executive is launched and the MKR is maximally split before acting. If the risk of doing multiple executives in one week is deemed to be too high, then I suggest we postpone monetary policy (in the absence of an emergency) if there is a technical change to be made.  I feel like the argument is being laid out between the best possible case for bundling, and the worst possible case for the alternative. Would you still be arguing for bundling if this weeks SCD SF poll had resulted in a 0% fee for SCD? The poll passed with 900MKR. A better attack vector given bundling would be to vote for a ridiculous stability fee and force a bundle with an unacceptable monetary policy change along with a required technical change. What happens in that situation? As an initial thought, the executive would probably be really conflicted which results in splitting MKR across executive votes which opens up the same attack vector only it could very well be worse, espeically since we may then need to split the unacceptable bundle and create one or two more executives. It\u2019s possible that a single controversial executive bundle (along with the cleanup in the aftermath) could split the Chief MKR worse than two \u2018easy pass\u2019 executives back to back. ",
