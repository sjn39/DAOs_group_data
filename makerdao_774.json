These terms seem to come up over and over again and I still don\u2019t understand many of the details behind them.  But I thought I would share because I think it is helpful for anyone who is looking to learn and understand the discussions that go on in the community.  Please let me know if I\u2019ve gotten anything wrong and feel free to add to the list if there are terms that could be added.  They seem to be a combination of core units, financial, crypto, and maker specific terms. https://makerdao.world/en/ and https://docs.makerdao.com/ have been very helpful.  I still struggle to understand the smart contract terms and documentation but that probably just takes time. Edit: This list is now mostly found in the Maker Operational Manual with additional links for further information.  Note there may be a few new acronyms not yet included there but the links are very helpful so check it out!
