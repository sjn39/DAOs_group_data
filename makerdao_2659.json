                    "content": "This post should be considered retired, and replaced with the Guide to the Signaling Process.   Retired Content The intention for this thread is to describe the current signaling process on these forums. It is meant to be descriptive and not prescriptive at this stage. Thus far it\u2019s mostly been me pushing this process and potential improvements that have been discussed in the past. I want to make it clear that anyone is welcome to start this process (or follow their own if they think they have a better process) on any issues of their choosing. With all that said, this is the process that I plan to follow for the most recent signaling thread.   Stage 1 Action: Determine if there is a majority for change in some form by asking a general question: \u2018Should we change from x\u2019 Justification: The intention behind this is to determine immediately whether there is consensus for the status quo. If there is, the process can end here before lots of effort is expended trying to forge agreement on specifics. Action: Call for discussion and suggestion on specific options that the community would like to see. Justification: In the interest of efficiency, specific options can be proposed and discussed before the desire for change has been determined. In addition, opening up the proposal to the community gives everyone a voice on the specific implementation. Action: Stage 1 lasts for one week. Justification: This gives enough time for the initial signal to have some weight without unduly delaying the decision making process. Action: The initial sentiment poll remains open for the duration of the process. Justification: Some people will not be able to check the forums once a week, this allows them to signal for/against change at any point during the process.   Stage 2 We move to Stage 2 if the initial sentiment poll has a simple majority after 1 week. Action: Create a multiple-choice poll allowing everyone to signal acceptance for each of the options proposed so far, this poll expires in two weeks. Justification: A multiple-choice poll lets us most efficiently rank the proposals according to consensus. Action: Stage 2 lasts for a minimum of 2 weeks. Justification: Two weeks gives plenty of time for discussion and signalling on the specific options proposed within the first week. Action: Additional specific proposals are welcomed and encouraged during step 2. Justification: It\u2019s possible that there will be no majority for any of the initially proposed changes. By allowing additional suggestions after this time we can parallelize the decision process.** Action: If after the two weeks are over, there is no majority for any of the proposed options, Stage 2 repeats. Justification: We should not adopt any proposal that does not have majority backing. By repeating stage 2 with a modified set of proposals, we have a better chance of reaching a majority. Action: Throughout this process, the importance of compromise and building consensus should be emphasized. Justification: The aim of this process is to find a solution that everyone can accept, rather than a solution that is everyone\u2019s first choice. By emphasizing this, you help remind signallers of this aim.   Stage 3 We move to Stage 3 if a single specific proposal has majority backing. Action: An on-chain poll is created in the form \u2018Specific consensus option, yes or no?\u2019 Justification: This lets MKR Token Holders to ratify the change, and confirm that the change is better for the system than the status quo. I don\u2019t think we need to vote on what the on-chain poll looks like individually for each proposal, so I\u2019m following the vote on the exponential rate stepping proposal. Action: Currently we\u2019re reliant on the Foundation to create on-chain polls, so Stage 3 involves convincing the Governance Facilitator to create this on-chain poll. Justification: This is necessary to get the poll on-chain. Action: The on-chain poll should last for a week. Justification: By this point, active MKR Token Holders should be aware of the prior proceedings, one week should be sufficient for those who wish to vote to do so.  Misc Thoughts  In a ideal situation, the time from proposal to on-chain poll is three weeks, with one week on the on-chain poll, that means total time for a change to occur is one month. With a controversial issue, the process to find consensus could take much longer. If Stage 2 fails to find a consensus option after three iterations, the change should be abandoned for a period not shorter than three months. If the initial sentiment poll drops below 50% and remains there by the time stage 2 ends, the change should be abandoned for a period of not shorter than one month.   As always, feedback is most welcome.  ",

These addresses are, at the moment, associated with wallets controlled by members of the foundation. Specifically, we run an off-chain cache configured to only track information on polls where  creator is in authorizedAddressList (eg [<0x1>, <0x2>, <0xabc>, ...]). If someone were to fork our frontend and run their own instance of our backend cache, they could configure it differently. So, for example, they could pick their own set of addresses to filter by, or they could remove the filter completely \u2014 as @LongForWisdom says, there is nothing in the PollingEmitter contract that limits who can call createPoll. Really the signaling system was designed to be open in this way from the beginning and at some point i\u2019d love to write more about how community members could create their own dashboards or cryptographically verify the foundation\u2019s. There\u2019s more to say about how it all works, but i\u2019ll leave it there for now unless there are specific questions  ",

Once more community members step up and formally take the reins for facilitator related tasks they will also be added to the list. It will be up to the community to figure out how exactly they want to coordinate the custodianship I think, and how they will go about electing the people to move the proposals into the system. Open polling is certainly an option but it\u2019s my hope that people will choose to engage with the community and work with the processes people are building here for signalling, debate, consensus seeking etc. We\u2019re still trying to understand how to build the social and procedural layers of this system (I had to check the forums today to make sure I\u2019m posting a proposal correctly) how will governance work if proposals just show up on chain without context or discussion?

I have heard mentions of looking to best-practices elsewhere for inspiration for open-source governance in the weekly governance calls. The vTaiwan process is something that I think is worth looking into to learn from. I think it would be useful to try tease out which aspects might be most worth testing our for the current MakerDAO governance process. One specific tool that they employ is pol.is, which is used with the goal of identifying consensus statements around complex issues. It strikes me as something which could help address some of the issues that have been coming up with the current signalling process:  identifying what is the rough consensus amongst the group helps discuss small edge cases related to a larger issue helps with the urge to repeatedly refine signalling polls and have ideas pushed on by a single person in a forum  Full disclosure: I was fascinated by the vTaiwan process after I learned a bit from a friend a few years ago, but I can\u2019t claim to know much beyond what I can google. I\u2019ve played around with pol.is as a tool to help with the consultation process through a civictech project with some others. ",
