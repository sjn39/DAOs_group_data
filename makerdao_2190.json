                    "content": "Hi, Maker community. 2023 is the restructuring year of MakerDAO. The initial stages of Endgame are underway, leading towards a more robust and resilient MakerDAO, Maker Protocol, and Dai. As Endgame develops, we expect substantial interest in how MakerDAO will change throughout this process and how it will affect Maker Protocol and Dai users. As the Brand team of the Growth Core Unit, our mission is to continue improving the MakerDAO brand presence, generate interest, and communicate what is happening inside the DAO. With Endgame being the key focus of what is happening inside MakerDAO, it is critical to have a communications plan to help the broader crypto community understand and stay on top of the topic. Bearing in mind GovAlpha Core Unit\u2019s work on an official internal documentation site for Endgame, we have been working on putting together a 2023 Endgame Communications Strategy. Our goal is to convert the internal knowledge base GovAlpha is developing into external strategic communications.  Why communicating strategically is important Last year, mentions of Endgame began to appear and the media shaped their own initial interpretations when Endgame\u2019s definitions were in a discovery phase. MakerDAO community members that are active in the forum are aware of the complexities involved in Endgame, and without a clear communication roadmap, those not active in the forum conversation could end up misinterpreting Endgame if we let external interpretations become the controllers of the narrative. Now that Endgame has made significant progress, it\u2019s time to outline the Endgame narrative for external audiences. Doing so will help us take control of the narrative in a way that benefits the Maker Brand, Dai holders, Maker Protocol users, and Endgame participants. the sooner we take advantage of the Endgame narrative, the better control we will have over it. In addition to informing you about our Endgame communications plan, this forum post aims to request your feedback on our approach to addressing this project   Comprehension through repetition in simple terms Our goal is to make Endgame comprehensive and understandable. This will allow our audience to understand the benefits of the Endgame for MakerDAO and help them to easily explain it to their own audiences. To achieve such a goal, repetition in understandable terms is effective. By reiterating the information in simple terms, we can increase understanding and as a consequence, gain control of the Endgame narrative as the restructuring effort that will take MakerDAO\u2019s decentralization to a new level and welcome the community to participate.  How to reach comprehension through repetition  1. Reduce complexity   To simplify Endgame\u2019s complexity, we started by selecting a manageable number of components and offering clear, easy-to-understand explanations for each one as part of our communication approach. We want to hear your feedback \u2192 Are these component definitions easy to understand? Do they convey correctly what they really are in Endgame? The selection comprises the following items:  Organizational: SubDAOs: smaller DAOs connected to the main MakerDAO. They will self-govern and self-sustain themselves using the new SubDAO tokens and their own products and services. Maker Core: defines all the components that are indispensable and unremovable for the Maker Protocol to fully function and fulfill its goals of generating and sustaining Dai. Facilitators: Facilitator SubDAOs are responsible for organizing the Decentralized Workforce of Maker Core, such as engineering, protocol management, and branding management. Creators: Creator SubDAOs are focused on growth and innovation in the Maker ecosystem. Protectors: Protector SubDAOs are focused on allocating collateral to real-world assets and protecting Maker against physical and legal threats to its real-world asset collateral.  Constitutional: Principles of the Endgame Constitution: Outlines the importance of achieving resiliency, scalability, and decentralization for the DAO, the Maker Protocol, and Dai. Preserve the purpose and meta of Maker and Dai: Focuses on maintaining the integrity of Maker and Dai by committing to decentralization. The easy voting frontend: Outlines the creation of a constitutionally regulated voting frontend to increase voter participation and ensure objective decision-making of MKR holders and its delegates. Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs): Defines the formalization of DVCs, which are groups of MKR holders with aligned visions, and their compensation. It also establishes incentives to encourage MKR holders to participate in delegating and governance by creating or joining DVCs. Delegates: Defines the roles and responsibilities of both full-time and part-time delegates, as well as their compensation and job security mechanisms. Professional Actors: Outlines the roles and responsibilities of Ecosystem Actors and new Core Units, and how they will perform their activities in accordance with the scopes and the constitution.  Products: SubDAO tokens: Each SubDAO has its own governance token, which will be initially distributed through rewards programs to create a more decentralized distribution of voting power. Ether Dai: It\u2019s an ETH-pegged token generated through the Maker Protocol against liquid-staked ETH collateral. Through Ether Dai generation, MakerDAO will be incentivized to accumulate as much decentralized staked ETH as possible. Core Elixir: It\u2019s the token that represents liquidity provided with Ether Dai, Dai, and MKR tokens. SubDAOs will be incentivized to accumulate as much Core Elixir as possible to demonstrate the success of their work to MakerDAO and enable more beneficial relationships with Maker Core. Meta Elixir: It\u2019s a token that represents liquidity provided with SubDAO tokens and MKR. SubDAOs will be incentivized to accumulate as much Meta Elixir as possible to receive a bigger share of MKR emissions. Endgame Tokenomics: Endgame introduces a new tokenomic model based on the emission of 60,000 MKR per year distributed to Meta Elixir holders.  2. Defining Endgame for external communications   To achieve such a level of comprehension, the central point of the narrative, known as Endgame, has to be able to be defined in a simple phrase. To provide the needed clarity on the core of the narrative, we used the following framework to define Endgame: Endgame aims to \u201cimplement something\u201d by \u201capplying a specific method\u201d to \u201cachieve a specific purpose\u201d. Some of the results of using this framework can be expressed with different words, but will always convey the same message: We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 When it comes to defining Endgame in simple terms, do these messages correctly convey what Endgame is in an easy-to-understand way? \u201cEndgame aims to improve MakerDAO\u2019s operations through the establishment of SubDAOs focusing on specific verticals, each with an associated SubDAO token to increase the resilience and transparency of the Maker Protocol within a changing cryptocurrency environment.\u201d \u201cEndgame aims to eliminate the current system-wide complexity by having individual tightly knit groups called SubDAOs, each with their own decision-making process, manage the development and operation of new products and services, to reinforce MakerDAO\u2019s resiliency and decentralized scalability.\u201d  3. Connect specific benefits to specific types of audiences   The most effective way to make a communication campaign successful is by directly linking benefits to their potential beneficiaries. Benefits are what will make people create a personal connection with Endgame and will bring them a clear sense of what value they will perceive. Therefore, we identified 4 specific groups of audiences and tied specific benefits to them. We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 What do you think about this audience-benefit composition and prioritization framework to communicate Endgame?     Priority Audience Benefit     1 DeFi participants (outside Maker\u2019s community) SubDAO token farming and SubDAO governance participation   2 Maker Community Clear and connected incentives between DAO participants and MKR holders. The DAO will become scalable and more resilient.   3 Institutions Dai holder farming for big treasuries and centralized product suites.   4 Developers Opportunity open to innovation through the creation of new products on top of Maker Protocol.     4. Narrative: The Endgame Book   Endgame information can be made more accessible and engaging by creating a storytelling setup for its presentation. The most familiar way to present a story is through a well-defined structure with a start, middle, and conclusion. The Endgame Book, comprised of chapters released at specific times, conveys the Endgame information in a manner that is easy to understand and actively engages with our audience. Based on Endgame\u2019s current status, the Endgame Book focuses on the Pregame phase, which is the most clearly defined stage of Endgame and covers the time period of 2023. This chapter-based setup also enables us to add further chapters as the development of the Midgame and Endgame phases becomes more defined. We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 Is the Endgame Book a good narrative structure to deploy Endgame Communication Strategy according to our desired communication goals? Initially, there are 5 defined chapters: Chapter 0: MakerDAO Introduces the Endgame Era \u2192 Endgame Introduction. Chapter 1: The Elemental Organizational Concepts \u2192 SubDAOs and Maker Core. Chapter 2: The Constitution \u2192 Endgame Constitution. Chapter 3: DeFi Witnesses the Endgame Products\u2019 Creation \u2192 Endgame Products. Chapter 4: The Launch of the New Foundational DAO Model \u2192 SubDAO token farming launch. Within each chapter, we also aim to set important announcements related to the Endgame development: SubDAOs, Metanomics, Endgame Forum, etc.  5. Renaming suggestions   As you may note, in this document we\u2019ve proposed new names for some of the moving parts of Endgame with the purpose of improving its compatibility with our strategy and its comprehension within the Endgame story. We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 Do the following renaming suggestion improve the understanding of Endgame moving parts? These are the renaming suggestions:     Prior name New name Rationale     Endgame Plan Endgame Era The word \u201cplan\u201d links Endgame to an idea brought up by an individual. Our audience may misinterpret it as \u201cEndgame is a one-man move\u201d, and the idea we want to convey is that Endgame is a transition period for MakerDAO where the whole community will participate.   Meta Elixir Sub Elixir With the word \u201cSub\u201d the name can help link this Elixir to SubDAOs, as it is made up of SubDAO tokens as a main ingredient.   Elixir Core Elixir Adding the word \u201cCore\u201d can help link this Elixir to Maker Core, as it is focused on improving the liquidity of Maker Core tokens (MKR, Dai, etc.)   Metanomics Endgame Tokenomics The word \u201cmeta\u201d doesn\u2019t form part of the story\u2019s core as MetaDAO was renamed SubDAOs. For better comprehension we add known terminology and suggest Endgame Tokenomics     Next steps With this forum post, we kick off a 2-week feedback session with the Maker community that will end on February 28th at 11:59 PM UTC. Once the feedback session closes, we will filter, internalize, and discuss all feedback received with the goal of improving our strategy. After the feedback is applied, we will start a planning phase with the following steps:  Defining a timeline for releasing the Endgame Book chapters. Drafting essential communications. Coordinating the creation of media assets that will add punches of energy to each publication.  With regard to media assets, we attach great importance to the visual impact our audience will have on Endgame. A cohesive set of visuals can greatly enhance the engagement of our content and strengthen the Endgame narrative in people\u2019s minds. For this reason, we prioritized the development of the following assets that will be a part of the Endgame Book and its implementation:  Endgame logo. Endgame visual style. Facilitators, Creators, Protectors, and SubDAO tokens logos. Endgame Book videos launch. (with similar purposes to our previous videos) Endgame Book GIFs and banners.  ",

This post is good stuff. Community feedback on the component definitions and messaging framework, as well as the audience-benefit composition and prioritization is much needed. Personally, we are proponents of visual aids or diagrams that can help illustrate Endgame\u2019s concepts:  Perhaps diagrams, flowcharts, etc.,  that show the relationship between Core, subDAOs, EAs, and how they work together to support the MakerDAO protocol. Timelines that highlights the milestones of the overall Endgame, Clusters to subDAO progress, Cluster to EAs, progress of scope implementations, timelines for subDAO token releases, etc. Graphics  explaining  SubDAO tokens and how they are farmed, or the concepts of ETHDAI and other Endgame products. Perhaps too early, but a  visualization of the new voting front-end and how it will work to increase voter participation and possible farming opps. (perhaps)      MakerGrowth:  Renaming suggestions    personally, \u201cEndgame Era\u201d gives us the feeling of something that has arrived and has not much urgency (like a pastime activity). Preference for the Endgame State/Endgame Plan. But could get used to it\u2026 Otherwise, preference for Metanomics \u2013 its a new realm. \u201cTokenomics\u201d is so 2015  ",

It would be useful to add that FacilitatorDAO will compromise the Facilitators accountable for Scope Frameworks, not only the workforce itself.     MakerGrowth:  Core Elixir: It\u2019s the token that represents liquidity provided with Ether Dai, Dai, and MKR tokens. SubDAOs will be incentivized to accumulate as much Core Elixir as possible to demonstrate the success of their work to MakerDAO and enable more beneficial relationships with Maker Core.   It seems V1 of Elixir will only be MKR/Dai. I liked how you explained it later in your post: \" it is focused on improving the liquidity of Maker Core tokens \" so it is \u201cgeneric\u201d to specific tokens.     MakerGrowth:  We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 When it comes to defining Endgame in simple terms, do these messages correctly convey what Endgame is in an easy-to-understand way?   I prefer the first version with some tweaks:  Endgame aims to improve ossify MakerDAO\u2019s core operations through the establishment of SubDAOs which focus on specific verticals, each with an associated SubDAO token to increase the resilience and transparency of the Maker Protocol within a changing cryptocurrency environment.  The word \u201cimprove\u201d is too generic, ossify is a method to push complexity out of the core into the edges (SubDAOs). Also, protocol ossification is related to governance minimization which is all about reducing complexity. These are concepts that mature and new protocols are working towards from DEFI 1.0 learnings. Maybe they are not known to non-DEFI audiences, but these are the specific pain points early protocols have brought which needs solving. ",

They will self-govern and self-sustain themselves using the new SubDAO tokens and their own products and services.   I\u2019m aware you\u2019re trying to keep these simple, so take these with a grain of salt:  Use MakerCore here. In terms of ordering these items, MakerCore should precede SubDAOs. The success of SubDAOs is bidirectionally linked to the success of MakerCore, might be worth trying to work this in?  Might be worth pushing MakerCore and SubDAOs both as the \u2018children\u2019 of MakerDAO, with MakerCore being the bigger brother or something?     MakerGrowth:  Facilitators: Facilitator SubDAOs are responsible for organizing the Decentralized Workforce of Maker Core, such as engineering, protocol management, and branding management.   Also they are responsible for running SubDAO governance processes.     MakerGrowth:  Creators: Creator SubDAOs are focused on growth and innovation in the Maker ecosystem.   Worth highlighting this is intended to be on-chain innovation (at least as I understand it)?     MakerGrowth:  Preserve the purpose and meta of Maker and Dai: Focuses on maintaining the integrity of Maker and Dai by committing to decentralization.   I think we\u2019ve dropped Meta as a term at this point, no?     MakerGrowth:  Decentralized Voter Committees (DVCs): Defines the formalization of DVCs, which are groups of MKR holders with aligned visions, and their compensation. It also establishes incentives to encourage MKR holders to participate in delegating and governance by creating or joining DVCs.   These were changed to Constitutional Voting Committees. The change is not just cosmetic, so the description needs rewriting.     MakerGrowth:  Delegates: Defines the roles and responsibilities of both full-time and part-time delegates, as well as their compensation and job security mechanisms.   Likewise, these have become Constitutional Delegates, again, not just a cosmetic change, so needs re-writing.     MakerGrowth:  Ether Dai: It\u2019s an ETH-pegged token generated through the Maker Protocol against liquid-staked ETH collateral. Through Ether Dai generation, MakerDAO will be incentivized to accumulate as much decentralized staked ETH as possible.   We\u2019ve been referring to this as one word EtherDai. Not sure if one or the other is more correct. I guess that\u2019s more in your court. Personally I prefer EtherDai.     MakerGrowth:  Endgame Tokenomics: Endgame introduces a new tokenomic model based on the emission of 60,000 MKR per year distributed to Meta Elixir holders.   I\u2019m not sure I would provide numbers here. They have changed several times. Also it\u2019s not SubElxir that receives the rewards (unless I\u2019m out of date again.) It\u2019s that the rewards go to the SubDAOs in various forms. But the point is the MKR distribution goes to subDAOs, not end users.     MakerGrowth:  \u201cEndgame aims to improve MakerDAO\u2019s operations through the establishment of SubDAOs focusing on specific verticals, each with an associated SubDAO token to increase the resilience and transparency of the Maker Protocol within a changing cryptocurrency environment.\u201d \u201cEndgame aims to eliminate the current system-wide complexity by having individual tightly knit groups called SubDAOs, each with their own decision-making process, manage the development and operation of new products and services, to reinforce MakerDAO\u2019s resiliency and decentralized scalability.\u201d   Not a huge fan of either of these, but this might be my general aversion to marketing-speak. In the first, the bolded section doesn\u2019t add information in my mind. Adding tokens doesn\u2019t magically provide resilience and transparency. For the second, it claims to reduce system-wide complexity by adding additional structures and groups. Like, if you have no knowledge of endgame, this will sound insane. As a potential alternative, given I have no marketing experience: \u201cEndgame aims to move the existing system-wide complexity in MakerDAO into new smaller groups called SubDAOs. Each SubDAO will be able to focus their efforts on a limited scope, increasing the efficiency and resilience of MakerDAO\u2019s operations.\" As to whether they convey the scope and meaning of endgame? Eh, not really. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible in only a few sentences, it\u2019s too broad.     MakerGrowth:  What do you think about this audience-benefit composition and prioritization framework to communicate Endgame?   On #1: Governance participation isn\u2019t really a benefit imo, it\u2019s a cost. People outside of the community could be voting right now in Maker if they wanted governance participation in Maker-stuff. On #2: Eh, sure. I disagree that Endgame will deliver that, but I\u2019m shouting into the void at this point. #3 seems fine. #4 Part of the benefit is probably for developers to get funded in developing stuff on top of Maker. People can already make stuff on Maker for free.     MakerGrowth:  We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 Is the Endgame Book a good narrative structure to deploy Endgame Communication Strategy according to our desired communication goals?   Sounds good? As someone with limited experience in marketing. Synchronizing chapters to other major events seems like a good way to increase exposure.     MakerGrowth:  We want to hear your feedback  \u2192 Do the following renaming suggestion improve the understanding of Endgame moving parts?   I disagree with the rationale behind changing endgame plan. For better or worse, this is Rune\u2019s plan, and not a community led endeavour. The community will participate in it because they\u2019re being forced to at metaphorical gunpoint. On a more practical level, I think \u2018Endgame\u2019 is currently an overloaded term anyway. It\u2019s being used to refer to both the final state and the plan describing how we\u2019re getting there. My suggestion would be: Endgame Plan: Should be used to refer to the set of changes that\u2019s being presented by Rune. Endgame Era: Should be used to refer to a specific period of time, either post-first-constitution ratification, or maybe we\u2019re already in it, and it started on the first vote. MetaElixir \u2192 Sub Elixir is fine and makes perfect sense. One point that is important that you may not have understood fully: SubElixir refers to a set of tokens, and not a single token. There is one for each SubDAO, with the SubDAO token paired against MKR. It is not a single token made up of every SubDAO token and MKR. One point is that we\u2019ve been using SubElixir (no space) as this matches SubDAOs. Elixir \u2192 Core Elixir: Feels a little unnecessary to me. I think in practice there is enough of a difference between Elixir and SubElixir, especially when you consider that SubElixir tokens will all end up with their own names depending on the SubDAO name. Metanomics: Yeah, we dropped meta, should also drop this.     MakerGrowth:  With regard to media assets, we attach great importance to the visual impact our audience will have on Endgame. A cohesive set of visuals can greatly enhance the engagement of our content and strengthen the Endgame narrative in people\u2019s minds. For this reason, we prioritized the development of the following assets that will be a part of the Endgame Book and its implementation:  Endgame logo. Endgame visual style. Facilitators, Creators, Protectors, and SubDAO tokens logos. Endgame Book videos launch. (with similar purposes to our previous videos ) Endgame Book GIFs and banners.    Here are some icons that we will be using in diagrams as part of the more detailed documentation that might be worthwhile to include in this work. There are likely more things we should include here, it\u2019s probably worth someone trying to figure out a full list prior to hiring an designer/artist.

Our goal is to convert the internal knowledge base GovAlpha is developing into external strategic communications.   Is looks like @GovAlpha-Core-Unit and @Growth-Core-Unit to some extent are collaborating on this task, and that is key to success here.  IMO it is important to make sure the exact same definitions are used in the constitution, the scope frameworks, the internal documentation and for external strategic communication. If not, we might face misunderstandings internally in the DAO. At the same time too simplified communication might misleading externals potentially causing negative consequences for the DAO.     MakerGrowth:  1. Reduce complexity   To simplify Endgame\u2019s complexity, we started by selecting a manageable number of components and offering clear, easy-to-understand explanations for each one as part of our communication approach.   Reduced complexity is fine and can be very helpful, as long as the right caveats are made, combined with links to the underlying sources.     MakerGrowth:  component   You list a number of components. I will not comment on each component, however from going through the constitution draft I want to add some additional components for your consideration.

Defining Endgame for external communications   To achieve such a level of comprehension, the central point of the narrative, known as Endgame, has to be able to be defined in a simple phrase.

To an average user of Dai, I expect the current description of the narrative to look a bit like a lesson in Algebra 2 read by someone who skipped Algebra 1. I suggest revisiting the existing description, and make sure it is up to date and combined with this endgame description. Going from minting (single collateral) Dai through CDPs to now using PSMs and RWA as collateral combined with the organizational changes is quite a change. By talking to several Dai holders, I noticed they stick to the old narrative. This tells me, this work is needed and the timing is just right.  Great initiative, thanks for doing this! ",

Looking at the WIP scope frameworks there is a role called \u201cAdvisors\u201d. These roles are very important in the ecosystem as they are domain experts. As we know, not many web2 / tradfi experts are available in DEFI. If we need a set of advisors per scope framework, then the Comms strategy at this Chapter, needs to turn from Branding objectives and KPIs into Lead generation / performance objective & KPIs. In normal companies, the procurement team will tell you that to award a project you need to get a proposal from 3 providers and pick one of them. If we need 3 advisors per scope framework. The Brand and Growth team should deliver at least 9 leads applying for Advisors per scope framework, so the community/Facilitator can choose the best of the best. The above is REALLY important to achieve and Maker is not excelling on this at all. We haven\u2019t seen a line of \u201carrangers\u201d for ProtectorDAOs or CreatorDAOs submitting in the forum the will to launch. We need top of the funnel leads and communicate better. Branding is great for long-term, but the Endgame has a short time frame, we need performance focus delivery as well. ",

                    "content": "Thank you for this post, it is really helpful both to recap and to set up \u201chow to talk about Endgame\u201d. My personal concern, and I\u2019ll admit to a bias at this point, is that Endgame is simply and fundamentally too complex. It\u2019s not about presentation or how you wrap things\u2026 To a non-core Maker stakeholder like myself, it feels like a contrived setup, which means we have not worked hard enough to simplify the mechanics and arrive at an elegant solution. That said, since I don\u2019t expect to convince anyone with my words above (I\u2019m not being sarcastic or bitter here - I state this plainly and with acceptance), let me try to be more constructive. I think the key part of marketing something like this is starting with the \u201cWhy\u201d. Why is Maker, arguably the longest-surviving DAO, with simple tokenomics that are relatively intuitive to understand, that have stood the test of time and multiple cycles, choosing to reorganize itself in this way? What are the reasons for each of the changes, and where does it get us / what does it buy us? We need to build the reasoning into how we talk about the added entities, tokens, and overall complexity (this could perhaps affect naming as well). I also think we should integrate some quantified testing into the process. We could run a couple of targeted online surveys to gauge how crypto-native and crypto-naive people respond to a quick Endgame explanation, and ask a couple of questions to check their comprehension. But it\u2019s only worth doing if we\u2019re truly open for pushback on our ideas. ",

                    "content": "Thanks for this effort @MakerGrowth - it\u2019s excellent. A few points of feedback below:     MakerGrowth:  Principles of the Endgame Constitution: Outlines the importance of achieving resiliency, scalability, and decentralization for the DAO, the Maker Protocol, and Dai. Preserve the purpose and meta of Maker and Dai: Focuses on maintaining the integrity of Maker and Dai by committing to decentralization.   I appreciate the challenge in boiling down the Endgame constitutional principles to just a few key takeaways, but I do think it would be a missed opportunity not to highlight clean money and the public good purpose embedded in the Constitution (ie, at 1.2 and 1.3 of the draft document). Maker reorientating in part towards an environmental and public good ethos will (or should!) drive some interest, likely more than the internal logistics of the Endgame reforms. If anything, I think this idea should be at the centre of the external communications strategy.     MakerGrowth:  From Endgame Plan to Endgame Era: The word \u201cplan\u201d links Endgame to an idea brought up by an individual. Our audience may misinterpret it as \u201cEndgame is a one-man move\u201d, and the idea we want to convey is that Endgame is a transition period for MakerDAO where the whole community will participate.   I quite like the branding idea of an Endgame Era - particularly because \u2018Endgame Plan\u2019 suggests a fully decided, prescriptive blueprint; underselling the active constitutional discussions and iterative changes that seem likely to continue through the Pregame. The other renaming suggestions also make sense, though \u2018Meta Elixir\u2019 sounds better than \u2018Sub Elixir\u2019 even if MetaDAOs are now SubDAOs.     MakerGrowth:  When it comes to defining Endgame in simple terms, do these messages correctly convey what Endgame is in an easy-to-understand way?   One final thought: it is easy to imagine how a lay audience might struggle with the Endgame\u2019s complexity (as @itamarro points out nicely in their comment), despite the laudable attempts in this strategy to simplify what gets communicated. A breakthrough in my own understanding was having some concrete SubDAOs proposed, giving a clearer sense of the kinds of organizational and product innovation that Endgame will hopefully spur. It might be a good idea to incorporate real examples like Phoenix Labs and the Viridian Cluster (and future SubDAOs) when painting a picture of what the Endgame will look like. ",
