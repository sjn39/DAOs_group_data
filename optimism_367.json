Stablenode has been a diligent participant in Optimism governance from the start of Season 1. They have engaged with proposers to offer feedback and have consistently reported back on their reasoning for why they voted how they did. Beyond this they have also been an active delegate at Balancer where I\u2019m a contributor. Despite the fact they are not compensated there they still take the time to provide thoughtful feedback and most importantly always vote - and we often have a lot of votes    From my interactions with Stablenode and Bobby in particular I can say without a doubt Optimism would be in good hands if they are granted a Badge for this initiative.

Additionally they have demonstrated a very long term commitment to the wider Ethereum ecosystem, of which Optimism is finding it\u2019s place within.

While they are not a well known name in crypto (like my other nominee) and don\u2019t have their own project to promote, their lack of bias or ulterior motives that in my view would make them an excellent candidate to receive a citizenship.

Can this person help advance the process and structure of retroPGF as a funding mechanism?   Is this person a domain expert in any of the categories up for funding in RetroPGF 2?   Has this person shown strong alignment with the long term growth of the Optimism ecosystem and the mission of the Collective?  @millie and @MinimalGravitas are two deeply involved figures in Optimism coming from different poles of interest. Both of them are undeniably model citizens along these dimensions, and I\u2019d love for them to help shape the future of RPGF. Millie\u2019s most visible role within governance is as a Synthetix Ambassador, but I think anybody who\u2019s spent time around the Optimism eco knows him as a highly independent thinker with a genuine commitment to the most fundamental tenets of Optimism, defi, and crypto more broadly. I know from the many disagreements we\u2019ve had that he\u2019s clearly a domain expert and general brain with regard to the app layer and that he\u2019d be quick to offer improvements and see what others might not. @MinimalGravitas, coming from a different view, has been a consistently thoughtful, principled voice coming from within governance, someone whose desire to keep pushing Optimism toward bigger goals is evident. They\u2019ve put in time where others haven\u2019t, participating in conversations of all kinds, spotting unique angles, and asking challenging questions. I\u2019d feel comfortable knowing they were an advocate. And critically, discussions on RPGF would I think be directly in their wheelhouse; they are as much an authority on all things \u2018public good\u2019 from first principles as anyone I\u2019ve witnessed among the highly active individuals here.

Unfortunately, delegates may not nominate themselves as outlined in Token House Badgeholder Election Information  so Fractal Visions cannot nominate itself. Additionally, nominees must be individual delegates, so an individual representative of Fractal Visions would need to be nominated. If one of you individually holds >0.5% voting power, you may nominate an individual representative of Fractal Visions (see nominations for bobbay on behalf of Stablenode, for reference) ",
