To continue to grow the developer ecosystem, I\u2019d love to see UNI governance approve sponsorships for hackathons\u2014specifically for developers building on Uniswap. One timely opportunity is ETHOnline (the hackathon organized by ETHGlobal) which starts this weekend. I\u2019m excited to see what participants will build with Uniswap, and it\u2019d be nice to provide a competitive reward to those that decide they\u2019d like to pursue that path. At the moment, funds in the Uniswap Protocol Treasury aren\u2019t yet accessible to UNI gov (I think for approximately 2 more weeks?) However, UNI governance does have control over approximately $200K worth of $SOCKS LP shares. How cute and effective would it be to award $SOCKS (or the ETH on the other side of the market) to hackers with the most innovative projects built with Uniswap at ETHOnline in the coming weeks? For UNI holders who are into this idea, some thoughts for discussion below. For ETHOnline:  How should UNI gov allocate $SOCKS to ETHOnline hackathon winners? How should hackathon participants submit their projects to UNI gov for consideration? Should UNI gov appoint delegates to judge hackathon winners? If not, how will UNI gov determine hackathon winners?  Beyond ETHOnline:  Can UNI gov establish an application process for hackathons to receive sponsorship to encourage participants to build on Uniswap?  Welcome thoughts. Would be an awesome and worthwhile scramble to try to make this happen before ETHOnline kicks off. A note to ETHOnline participants: get in here and tell us what you think! ",

I\u2019m not sure exactly how to reward the winners using the $SOCKS LP tokens but maybe a couple options could be transfer the LP tokens to the winning team address so they can earn trading fees or give the winning team a few $SOCKS tokens as a prize so they can redeem for the real socks? I\u2019m still trying to figure out limitations to governance and voting but I think it would be really cool as an UNI holder to be able to vote for the best (most meaningful) projects. Maybe a separate \u201chackathon voting dashboard\u201d is created for this purpose? The dashboard can have all pertinent info (team members, link to demonstration, github code) so every UNI holder could review and judge the projects independently? Regarding future hackathons, the community could decide within this forum a team who can handle the application process and reach out and pay (from treasury) developers who can create a voting dashboard. Just some thoughts, I\u2019m interested to hear what the rest of the community has in mind! ",
