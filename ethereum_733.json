I\u2019m unsure on the etiquette of noise control in replies but;  How would we get badges implemented? Who would distribute them for each event/circle - could this go in hand with https://kickback.events/ by https://twitter.com/makoto_inoue or would that make things more complicated/formal than they should be?  It also felt we were trying to solve the bystander-effect without entertaining the idea of stewards having delegating powers/some control of leadership to put accountability to action items not being actioned (get shit done) ",

I already talked to @jpitts about more mods on the forum \u2014 we\u2019ll get an issue filed around that and nominate a group to work on this.
