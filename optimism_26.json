                    "content": "Have seen enough wallets collect the OP airdrop, swap it straight to Uniswap. These accounts are not playing a constructive role in Optimism governance. Instead of contributing to governance, they are maximising for profit. Nothing wrong with that, as per the airdrop criteria the coins are theirs and they are free to do as they wish. However, from Optimism governance\u2019s perspective, such accounts are counter-productive for our stated goals. Hence, this proposal is to discuss excluding such accounts in all the future distribution of Optimism\u2019s airdrop. Also, we can make a public list of accounts that engage in this behaviour, so that other projects and DAOs can also choose to borrow from our work - I believe many projects will be interested in rewarding those who actually contribute to governance, rather than those who just see ownership given into a protocol as a short term liquidity bonus. After identifying sybil accounts, the next progressive step is to identify zero contribution accounts which do not engage with the governance, and hence should not be eligible for any governance weight. Lets look at some of the top tier/ multiplier eligible wallets accounts that have dumped OP and gained $40k. Address 0x1092361f4eafdc6e4555ee761e87ef9c67b9e42f | Optimism - Swapped entire airdrop 32,421 OP for 45,894 USDC. Then sent it out of Optimism via HOP. Purely mercenary, net loss to Optimism. Address 0x34cd8a21e92b0abd558ff02d6cc7a9e12daf0ff1 | Optimism - Swapped entire 32,421 OP airdrop for ETH and USDC. Address 0x5f350bf5fee8e254d6077f8661e9c7b83a30364e | Optimism - Swapped entire 32,421 OP airdrop for 38,000 USDC. Address 0xcffe08bdf20918007f8ab268c32f8756494fc8d8 | Optimism - Entire 32,000 OP airdrop dumped for 48,000 USDC. Indeed, quite a few good actors have delegated, have added LP etc. However these above addresses are just 4 wallets from hundreds of similar walelts who have dumped almost the entire airdrop. Many more such wallets can be easily identified from the Dune analytics page: Optimism's OP Airdrop \ud83d\udd34\ud83c\udf81 Why should Optimism Collective continue rewarding these kind of mercenary actors who will dump their tokens on first sight? Why should any future airdrops reward these addresses? Of course, it is their coins so they are free to do what they want, but at the same time it defeats the purpose of Optimism Collective and dilutes governance if negative sum participants keep getting rewarded airdrops that they are going to dump the very next transaction after claiming it.

Eventually, they will dump when there are no longer any airdrops. Also, we don\u2019t always know why people sell, they may need liquidity. Banning people from all airdrops for selling once may be a bit extreme. It will also concentrate the distribution of the next airdrop which is not ideal as well. The way I look at it is if they sell, then it\u2019s an opportunity for those that want to be a part of the collective to buy. Instead of focusing on banning people that sold, focus on those that held or bought OP. Come up with a structured proposal for holders. Lastly, this post should of started in the ideas section. This is not a proposal. It lacks structure and concrete guidelines. Before creating a proposal submit it to the ideas section to flush out the idea. ",

Plus, other projects like ZipSwap have already started liquidity mining where people can earn OP. Many other projects are also going to distribute OP in the coming days. Lots of people can get their share of OP from all these places. It wont really concentrate ownership - all other accounts are allowed, and anyways around 250,000 accounts are eligible for the first airdrop. There are maybe 10-20k accounts that have dumped the entire OP airdrop immediately on a DEX. The entire stack. If you look at the Dune dashboards, you can see these accounts easily. There is no argument to make that these kind of actions are helping governance. Those that want to can still be part of the collective and be welcomed here. Im just making the case that those who are selling entire portions of the first airdrop with the 2nd transaction (after delegate) are not in the interests of the collective to keep giving them more. I think it is a simple argument that can make the collective more aligned with people who believe in it, over people who want to just contribute bare minimum to get their airdrop and then bid goodbye as they have taken out their reward. The first set is very welcome, the second set should be treated in the same manner as sybil attackers or the same as mercenary liquidity problem faced by DAOs. ",

Just because someone sells does not mean they do not have plans to rebuy. When there is an opportunity to make several thousand it is silly not to take it. All that said though, the difference with me is I bought OP tokens after prices got better. These type of things need to be taken into consideration. It would be just silly not to make obvious money in Defi. I mean, if we follow the line of thought from original poster, there would be no market for OP tokens. Also, where do you draw the line? Does the guy who sold half of his OP tokens get excluded? The guy that sold all high and bought low?  Some people are very poor, and really didn\u2019t have a choice but to sell. I do like the sentiment, but it is overly harsh and possibly a more moderate viewpoint would be better for the community as a whole. Also, what about the people who didn\u2019t get airdropped but bought a bunch of OP tokens? Maybe in the future just look to reward OP token holders, thats probably going to be the most considerate for all. ALSO remember, optimism users pay fees on every transaction whether they own OP or not. Everyone is a paying customer. Just think things threw, as when you are mad you might not be considering all of the possibilities. Oh and I should mention that it was my next transaction after delegating governance, then I rebought a couple hours later. I am not sure why I should be any less entitled than anyone else seeing as I hold my OP tokens but had profited off them. Just saying it makes no sense. ",

I got the airdrops and have not sold a single one of them. Of course will sold some when the time is right and if i need to. We cant force anyone to be here. Airdrops hunters would most likely not add any value to any protocol. Yes i agree the subsequent airdrops should be restrictive and not be as generous as the first. Some people, who are very active in the OP ecosystem and have been from day 1 might have sold. They earned every piece of that airdrop. They have every right to sell as they are not airdrop hunters but actual ecosystem players. Are we going to exclude them from future airdrops because they sold their share? I dont think that is right or makes sense. The future airdrops could be contingent upon being active in the ecosystems and contributing to many aspects like ecosystem growth, voting, governance, etc. May be the more you participate in these, the more you will be entitled to.

I didn\u2019t do this (I just put my share into liquidity).  But I know there will be people who did because they know markets and to act as though they don\u2019t care about optimism because they sold when they suspected it would drop for a buy back seems wrong.  I don\u2019t think that type of move is opposed to optimism ideal of flexibility.  So if we were to penalize sellers I do think we should take into consideration addresses that bought back in (maybe an untold snapshot time frame that would be revealed at the second drop so as not to encourage half hearted buy backs.)  I also don\u2019t think we should penalize addressees that would have sold partial to provide liquidity (halfsies).  I didn\u2019t do this because I could afford the other half but I don\u2019t think anyone should be penalised for providing liquidity.  Someone who sells and remains empty of OP probably is the intended target, but even then there will be people who can\u2019t afford not to sell in this market but still participate where they can.  I think we need a nuanced proposal. ",

Set airdrop conditions to ensure that all those who gain from future airdrops participate in the ecosystem and its protocols, governance, etc. We need to grow the  TVL and make the ecosystem one of the biggest L2s, if not the biggest. We cant marginalize genuine and potential players due the action of just few. A balanced approach is needed in my opinion ",

People who have not sold OPs can get a certain higher proportion of the subsequent voting rights, and a reasonable proportion can be set. 2. Because there are many follow-up projects in the official development, of course, the wallets that support the OP project on the OP network should be treated equally, and you cannot inquire about their previous handling of the OP. \u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8ba8\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u5356\u6389OP\u7684\u4eba\u662f\u5426\u5c31\u5f53\u505a\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u540e\u7eed\u7a7a\u6295\u7684\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u80fd\u628a\u5356\u6389\u4e86OP\u6216\u8005\u63d0\u53d6OP\u5230\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u5730\u5740\u5f53\u505a\u793e\u533a\u7684\u5bf9\u7acb\u9762\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u601d\u7ef4\u662f\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06OP\u52a0\u5165\u8d44\u91d1\u6c60\uff0c\u4f60\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002 \u51e0\u70b9\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u672a\u51fa\u552eOP\u7684\u4eba\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u6295\u7968\u6743\u6bd4\u91cd\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u6bd4\u91cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002 \u4e8c\u3001\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b98\u65b9\u662f\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u540e\u7eed\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5bf9OP\u7f51\u7edc\u652f\u6301Op\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u94b1\u5305\u5f53\u7136\u5e94\u8be5\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u80fd\u53bb\u67e5\u8be2\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e4b\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8eOP\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f ",

If you don\u2019t immediately sell it for stables and the price drops to $1 and stays there for a year you owe income tax on $2,000 but have on hand only $1,000 to pay it. ",

By blacklisting sellers, the opposite result would most likely happen (see what happened to Paraswap\u2026) On top of that, some users may have sold for tax purposes, because they wanted to LP, or maybe because they could use that money to play in the ecosystem and potentially get future airdrops. Instead of blacklisting the sellers, I\u2019d rather take into account those who held and/or LPed for the next phase airdrops. Instead of having a -EV mindset, let\u2019s try to focus on the bright side of things and incentivize cooperation and positive sum environments. ",

The proposal however does seem a bit reactionary and i\u2019m not sure blacklisting accounts that sold would benefit the Optimism ecosystem or help enforce the community values. A few questions we could ask instead: What are the incentives to hold? -Alignment with Optimism values -To get involved with governance -Excitement around the OP community Does blacklisting accounts provide an incentive to hold and join the community or just an incentive not to sell? Is this natural? What are the incentives to sell? -Tax obligations -Profit motivations -Money could be better used elsewhere -Bear market Are the market conditions helping? If we airdrop to the same accounts when times are better, would the same people not feel the need to sell as much and instead join the community? A lot of the people I have spoken too who have sold haven\u2019t done it because they don\u2019t believe in our values, they\u2019ve done it because the benefit of selling is greater than holding. We should be working on how we can make the benefit of holding greater than selling if we want the ecosystem to thrive long term. Blacklisting accounts also runs the risk of de-legitimising the Optimism ecosystem which can hurt for far longer than the airdrop being sold on day 1. If we alienate people this early on it could cause some serious long term damage. Full disclosure, I sold 70% of the airdrop as it was a lot of money for me. The remaining 30% is being held onto with the plan to get involved long term. ",

Are people supposed to hold on until the day they die even if this airdrop might have changed their lives? There are others who are buying, meaning the tokens will just be redistributed between the people who want to be a part of Optimism. Secondly, more community efforts should be spent on excluding sybil users instead of users, who have really used the protocols in the past. Then why include them at all, if you don\u2019t think they deserve it? Why not use all previous airdrops to exclude them from the start? I started using Optimism last year because I also thought there might be an airdrop in the future, but I stayed for cheap fees and apps like Lyra. I sold a part of my airdrop, because I needed the liquidity for another opportunity, and might buy into $OP at a later time, but why am I not worthy of getting the next airdrop, even if I am planning to participate in governance discussions, vote for proposals, etc. I am not rich to HODL everything, so I am worse than others?

I think the sentiment behind trying to find contributors is correct but like others, we are people that live in different parts of the world and different economic situations. In my case, I have an tax rate of over 35% on any income which airdrops are counted within. Thus for me to sell and get enough out after slippage and fees 40% provides enough. Also, I have then sold some more to be able to provide liquidity on Uniswap in the OP/USDC pool which I would argue is beneficial regardless of the price that I sell at. Other portions of the Airdrop have gone to be able to test some other protocols on Optimism through staking, trading, and providing liquidity. I am sure like many others, I work a full time job, have a life, and family, I cannot be around every day to be able to participate and check in on governance so I do my best but for anyone very active in this space, they likely hold 10+ different governance tokens and likely do not participate in all of the voting. The proposal seems quite rash, would I be immediately punished because I sold to cover myself legally for taxes or to use protocols on Optimism? If anything, provide a way for people to lock tokens and get a bonus as that would more then likely be the preferred route for an active user correct? If they are able to gain a larger % holding in voting? ",

Or well, it is true only if you speak about the price. But if you speak about the price it means that you are only interested to the project for dumping it a higher price. In governance perspective, instead, the dumpers are not always bad, because if they cannot be active part of the governance at that moment and do not know to who delegate the tokens, it is better to sell. It is better for them (instant gain from something they cant follow) and is better for the community because the token is bought from somebody else that care about it and probably he wants to delegate or being active part of the community and governance. I would use more severity on those accounts that are eligible for historical airdrops but they do not claim them or they claim and never do any activity with them. No active users on the governance etc. They are only holding, that is fine for the price which is not dropping for their fault, but token price is not the thing that matter for the life of the community. Community needs active members, so if you cant be an active member, just sell the governance token to somebody else, or at least delegate it (not randomly). Better sell than delegate it to random ppl. ",

The $OP airdrop criteria and rewards are there; the Sybils/farmers are sorted out. What is not fair here? Nature of crypto and web3: It is designed to be permissionless and decentralized. We are blaming the banks for their control, and now are not letting the users decide what to do with their reward? Secondly, crypto is aiming to increase the level of prosperity all over the world, for many this is the only chance to legally earn \u201clife-changing money\u201d. What is wrong if common users are selling their airdrops?  My suggestion is to look into (big?) accounts who claimed the tokens before the official start of claiming, or did any similar malicious behavior. And let the retail users enjoy their earned rewards, after the Luna-crash, bearish market, etc. We will all benefit from it in the end! ",

I don\u2019t think it is reasonable to use the \u201cofficial\u201d start of the claiming as a measure of malice. The airdrop URL was made public on github, shared on discord, and when I went to it the airdrop was functional. This ended up being during the short window of testing, and it was (sort of) disabled shortly after. There was no indication that the airdrop was \u201cnot live\u201d yet, and, frankly, that wouldn\u2019t matter anyway. The airdrop was live, intentional or otherwise. If the team had an official start in mind, it was their responsibility to prevent anyone from claiming prior to that start time. ",

On the one hand, it does feel unpleasant to those that hold through good times and bad to see others immediately sell off. On the other, there are plenty of legitimate reasons someone might need to sell off and, as others have mentioned, there are many ways that they could still be invested in the success of the project beyond just holding their initial tokens. The bonus multiplier approach for those who claimed / delegated without selling seems to strike a good balance here, but honestly depending on the amount of effort required I wouldn\u2019t necessarily over-index on it. I know from Gitcoin\u2019s airdrop that many people spent weeks debating how the drop could have been tweaked or improved and in my opinion it took valuable time away from building out the product and pushing forward the mission (again if it\u2019s an easy change that might be different).

The % of supply held by each HODLer doesn\u2019t change. In order to sell, someone has to buy. Here, AMM liquidity providers are agreeing to buy. As the price falls, some amount of people who believe in $OP will buy it. If $OP\u2019s fully diluted value is too high, the market will reprice it. Repricing isn\u2019t a bad thing. It lets people get accurate market information on expectation\u2019s of $OP\u2019s success. Making some people ineligible for future airdrops is just transferring their $OP to other people who are eligible. In fact, it does so at a price of $0. So it removes the ability for $OP supporters to signal support through purchasing $OP. If you want $OP and support it - buy it! Can/should $OP tweak future airdrops? Sure. But it doesn\u2019t need to be vindictive. Just reward the behavior you want: using optimism. If I sell my $OP because it has no revenue mechanism or doesn\u2019t fit my risk profile - but then I use the L2 can you really call me negative-sum? Would you really want to exclude me from future airdrops for being a user + seller? If anything people who don\u2019t claim are worse than people who claim & sell. At least claim & sellers are putting $OP into circulation so that fans can buy it. I would be more worried about people holding $OP and doing nothing: not using the L2, not delegating, just restricting its velocity. The economic theory on this is clear. The market will set a price, people will own it at whatever prices they are comfortable, and Optimism will be valued based on its perception of success. Who cares about the price anyway, just use the token, participate in governance, and use the chain. ",

The project has become a user, the failure of the user, at this time should be more from the user\u2019s point of view. At present, the users who can get airdrop are early contributors, no matter what kind of degree he is optimistic about op, if they do not go to use op, I believe op is not so easy to get financing, the team development progress is also unlikely to be so fast. For users to receive airdrops and then sell them, this should be a very normal form of behavior, just like when a company has financing or goes public, isn\u2019t it normal for early shareholders to want to share the dividends? So we should consider what value we can have by holding the coins, and enhance the governance function of the tokens out. Users who are really optimistic will naturally choose to keep their tokens and continue to participate. The one-size-fits-all approach is too hasty. ",

I would suggest a less severe form of future airdrop penalization, one that takes into account active on-chain use. Something like:  -100% future airdrop penalty for any user who has sold their OP allocation, bridges off-chain, and has no significant onchain activity on Optimism after that. -50% future airdrop penalty for any user who has sold their OP allocation, bridges the value of that sale off-chain but continues to use the Optimism network in a significant fashion. No future airdrop penalties for users who sold their OP allocation but did not bridge the value out and continue to actively use the network.  The only issue with this methodology is that it can be obviously be gamed if known in advance, but this is just an idea off the top of my head. The main point is, limit the punishment for people who are active Optimism users, maximize the punishment for those who dumped their allocation and left. ",

But you have to realize that Person A sells his initial token and Person B gets his initial token at the same time. Person B could be a potential contributor who notices OP token in the market and becomes interested in OP community governance. If you want to punish dumpers by whether they sell token or not, this dimension is hard to define. Time to sell? Percentage of sale? On the flip side, why should we care about the token price in the first few days when we are all long runners? Will this have a big negative impact on the community? Even if the price goes to zero, it doesn\u2019t matter. Look, there were many dumper who sold on the first day when the ETH token was launched, and of course they all regretted it. Stay optimistic. My point is that if you want to avoid speculation, the best way is not to PUNISH people who sell on day 1, but to reward people who continue to hold (e.g. RSS3\u2019s second airdrop for those who continue to hold the initial airdrop) ",

There are many reasons to sell, from just wanting to dump, to wanting to recover costs, LP, needing some $, etc. Some of these people who sold early may become valuable community members.  Instead, have criteria for future airdrops that reward the behaviors we would like to see.  For example:  Hodlers - wallets who never sold, get some portion of future airdrop. and/or Investors - those who own an equal amount or more than their initial allocation get a portion of the airdrop. and/or Partial investors - those who own 50% or greater of the initial token allocation get a portion of the airdrop.  Those who dumped hard and left do not get to participate in those criteria, but it always leaves the door open. ",

We can\u2019t blame someone selling and be mad because of a price drop this is purely based on emotions.   -next airdrop should be equally distributed and not solely based on the earlier allocation as this will make room for better reward, as long as user is a repeat user, voter.

For already mentioned reasons by others, the reasons may differ and we shouldn\u2019t exclude people who sell. The one way how this can be deal with is to a time-weighted coefficient of tokens held and tokens delegated to governance, eg. For 2nd airdrop:  Time since 1st airdrop: 300 days Number of tokens held: 200 during 150 days Number of tokens delegated: 100 during 100 days  Next airdrop: time-weighted tokens held * K1 + time-weighed tokens delegated * K2 K1 = coefficient 1 (smaller) K2 = coefficient 2 (higher) This would flush out sellers while it would reward long-term holders and long-term holders who delegated governance. This may be non-trivial to calculate, but OP can create a public bounty to implement this with configurable parameters. ",

Retroactively banning people for selling a token is borderline idiocracy. It\u2019s a slippery slope making proposals that exclude people for doing X action, because it could set an unwanted precedent of banning and restricting users for all kinds of so called \u201charmful actions\u201d. Let\u2019s not forget that a governance token is SUPPOSED to be transferable so that other people have the right to become governance voters. If the OP team really are displeased with people selling their token, then why were all the biggest exchanges ready to start selling OP from day 0? I would wager that a huge chunk of people nodding to this proposal are just salty individuals who wanted to sell early but the token dumped before they even got theirs. How did some get theirs over others? This was because OP team were testing in production, allowing people to use their frontend for a split second AND because there were not any locks or controls setup on the claim contract so they couldn\u2019t stop people from interacting with the contract directly. And before you lump those early claimer people into the \u201csybil attacker\u201d or \u201cairdrop hunter\u201d crowd, maybe you should all go and take a hard look at what Sybil attacks even are, because it\u2019s obvious that a lot of you have no clue. People have been interacting with smart contracts directly AND/OR via scripting since day 1, that\u2019s kind of the point of programmable money! That doesn\u2019t make you a \u201csybil attacker\u201d! All in all, I will be voting against this proposal if it ever goes that far, and if it passes, I will be passing on OP as it will mean that OP is compromised by group think. ",

Much of the conversation on this thread can be summarized by attempts to understand why people commit certain actions and at the scale we\u2019re operating at, it\u2019s not possible to determine without significant time investment and trade off (which is not worth the opportunity cost in my opinion). 2- I believe that ideally, airdrops shouldn\u2019t function punitively, but rather be positive-sum. I am lukewarm on the idea of providing a \u201cmultiple\u201d for those who held $OP, I think the main mechanisms should be closer to the heart of the vision (impact = profit), simply holding a token is not impact. On the livestream last night when asked about what to do about qualifying for Airdrop #2 @karl simply stated: \u201cbe a good person\u201d or something to that effect, big fan of that. 3- In my opinion there are (more) and better options for rewarding positive sum behavior in the community (using Optimism, participating in governance, supporting public goods, building new things) ",

Token sold or other arbitrary %'s) may be quite effective and offer an incentive to hold & participate. Users will inherently sell/distribute tokens to provide for Liquidity Pools and Profits (not all users have much capital in general for Defi, me included, but wish to participate in these protocols regardless to some degree, but their only way to continue participating would be allocating some degree of profit taking). Remember, some average salaries worldwide are <500 USD monthly, and most goes to rent, electricity, water, etc. Defi is a luxury to many communities worldwide; Average Indian Salary per month I am a user who, for instance, sells/distributes for altruistically distributing between new users within my community in Latin Am whom are affected by the aforementioned information above. I think slashing  future Phases of OP drops based on Snapshots reviewing A) Phase Distributions + Holding Periods(to deter VC\u2019s like a16s,3ac, from accumulating possibly low-priced tokens and gaining governance from future drops) B) Arbitrary Sale %  Limits (mentioned in 1st paragraph) and possibly C) Snapshot of current holdings in certain wallets (we shouldn\u2019t also negate new users whom weren\u2019t included in airdrops whom wish to buy in to the governance model. With that being said, newer users need to be vetted diligently via On-Chain analysis (e.g. DAO Voting Participation + Forum Participation, holding periods, Repeat User Metrics, Dates of Usage, Gitcoin Donations, analysis on other chains) I also suggest Hands on Education (videos, weekly training/all hands meetings) on governance for new users/seasoned users to teach how holding/participating in Gov Voting are incentives in the long run. (e.g. education on how liquidity works, MCAP, mechanisms behind staking pools, token delegation, etc) Great community & Drop btw; Hope these opinions help to some degree. ",

There may be individuals who sold with hopes of buying back lower and punishing them will drive them to other L2s/L1s.  If a system is put into place to find true mercenary selling (selling entire airdrop AND bridging off the network), imo those are the only ones that should meet punishment. ",

Banning people from all airdrops for selling once may be a bit extreme. It will also concentrate the distribution of the next airdrop which is not ideal as well. The way I look at it is if they sell, then it\u2019s an opportunity for those that want to be a part of the collective to buy. Instead of focusing on banning people that sold, focus on those that held or bought OP. Come up with a structured proposal for holders. Lastly, this post should of started in the ideas section.

Let\u2019s face it, the majority of the people just want more tokens. Will they REALLY participate in governance? If the token becomes non-transferable(or goes to zero), I\u2019m sure all of a sudden they would find governance not interesting anymore. This proposal is like introducing staking without actually saying it. Personally, I think we should just do all governance in the citizen house, one vote per person, like in real life. And just delete the OP token. VC and the Optimism team can convert to equity instead. ",

It will literally handle itself without governance action.  If they receive new tokens in the future, and sell them as well, and this causes the price to drop, then they are giving people who have not been awarded an airdrop a means to join the governance community. So far, I\u2019m only seeing positive outcomes to general distribution of tokens to everyone who qualifies, regardless of their desire to govern or delegate or sell. The only downside to airdrop recipients selling is the price drop, and the only people that \u2018hurts\u2019 is speculators that intend to sell when the price is higher. ",

                    "content": "I think the multiplier is the right way to go here, just because of narrative reasons really. From Optimism\u2019s perspective there is no real benefit to giving tokens to people just so they can sell them, while people can frame it as helping to provide market liquidity or whatever, those aren\u2019t really core benefits to the Optimism Collective. Lots of the arguments here that sellers shouldn\u2019t miss out on the next airdrop seem to not be thinking about it in terms of the primary reason for the drop, it\u2019s not to egalitarianly give people money. On the other hand, clearly plenty of people who do want to participate in governance, public goods discussion, building the ecosystem and other general phoenix spawning activities will still have sold some of their tokens, even if just for tax reasons. Therefore rather than blacklisting addresses, surely the solution is that sellers should get less of the next airdrop. Obviously it doesn\u2019t numerically make much of a difference if this takes the form of multiplying the next allocation by the percentage you held (so if you sold 20% you\u2019d only receive 80% of the next one) or the inverse with lower base amounts, so non-sellers would get extra by some factor compared to sellers\u2026 but because humans aren\u2019t great at maths I\u2019m sure the latter would be seen as the better option!

This really is the key issue. Lots of the arguments from those thinking sellers shouldn\u2019t miss out on the next airdrop seem to not be considering it in terms of the primary reason for the drop. It\u2019s not to egalitarianly give people money but rather the purpose is surely to get voting power into the hands of those likely to use it. This should be the main consideration. All of the reasons for selling that he lists are perfectly reasonable (I made the point about tax above), but they are things that the Optimism Collective shouldn\u2019t be caring about in my opinion.    Extended ineligibility for future airdrops    They think the valuation of OP is currently too high and they can wait until it becomes aligned with their expectations in order to participate in governance, and thus have a larger governance share. They think the valuation is okay, but they expect a post-airdrop dump. They want to buy lower and they think they can sell quickly before this \u201cairdrop dump\u201d happens and rebuy more OP. The airdrop is meaningfully large for their net worth, so selling some tokens makes a big difference to them, but they still believe in the future of Optimism. They sold on airdrop addresses and rebought on other addresses to anonymise their on-chain activity. They have tax obligations. They are selling 90% of their crypto portfolio because they are scared of a bear market, but they will rebuy in a couple of years. They are fucking rekt and this $ income helps them a lot, maybe one day if they are no longer rekt they can afford to participate in governance of the projects they believe in again.    The only part of his reply that seems to address the choice from Optimism\u2019s perspective, rather than from the airdrop recipient\u2019s is the following, which does make a reasonable point:    Extended ineligibility for future airdrops   Imagine two users:  User A is a regular, legitimate user of Optimism. They get all their friends to use Optimism. They have a lot of daily on-chain activity. They have no interest in participating in governance, so they sold their initial airdrop. User B delegated their initial airdrop and didn\u2019t participate at all in governance either. They still hold their tokens and their delegate votes every now and then. They have used Optimism once per month.  Which user is most valuable to Optimism? Which user should be rewarded in future airdrops?   There are clearly other ways than governance for users to benefit Optimism. I\u2019m definitely against the idea of blacklisting addresses based on whether they sell or hold the token, but I do think there is value in making this one of the criteria in determining future airdrops, such as using it as a multiplier as suggested above (Users who sold the initial OP airdrop should become ineligible for all future airdrops - #34 by polynya) or as a binary criteria as per the 6 factors in airdrop 1. In Cobie\u2019s example the User A should probably get some OP from using Optimism which should be another of the criteria. An additional User C who both used the rollup regularly and holds/delegates their tokens to someone who represents their values/opinions should get a larger 2nd airdrop than either of the first two.

Jeez, this proposal really just seems to benefit the people proposing it. Having thousands locked in value all over the optimism network means nothing, and you can\u2019t sell any of your rewards, EVER, or you will be punished severely.

                    "content": "    MinimalGravitas:  I\u2019m not really convinced that he addressed the key point from your Twitter thread, notably that:  I think confusion stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what the airdrop is supposed to achieve.  This really is the key issue. Lots of the arguments from those thinking sellers shouldn\u2019t miss out on the next airdrop seem to not be considering it in terms of the primary reason for the drop. It\u2019s not to egalitarianly give people money but rather the purpose is surely to get voting power into the hands of those likely to use it. This should be the main consideration. All of the reasons for selling that he lists are perfectly reasonable (I made the point about tax above), but they are things that the Optimism Collective shouldn\u2019t be caring about in my opinion.   I think this largely ignores market forces and the speculative mechanics of an airdrop. Airdrops effectively act as a paid cost for growth that is spent in equity instead of in cash. Perhaps in 2020 it was reasonable to say that they were not, since the idea of retrospective airdrops were quite novel, and users did not have reasonable expectation of a future airdrop in exchange for usage. But in 2022, users are aware they will become owners of a protocol by using the protocol.  An impending airdrop juices metrics (such as DAUs) which in turn increases the adoption and the valuation of Optimism. And there are good market examples of a bad, exclusionary airdrop killing user metrics (since speculo-users are now dissuaded, and any excluded real users are also dissuaded). It\u2019s similar to a paid referral program \u2013 sign up to this product and get $100 free usage. Except it is paid in equity instead of cash or discounts. Now, if you believe that it is really a distribution of governance responsibilities and in no way a paid growth mechanic, then the path forward is very simple. If you want to only airdrop governance responsibilities to those that might want it, then you can issue a non-transferrable token with governance rights. Those that do not want to use it can simply ignore it, and those that do can vote with the governance rights they have earned. But that is not the choice Optimism made, because they know that such a decision would cause many users to stop using Optimism.  So, I do not buy the argument that the purpose of the airdrop was solely to deliver governance responsibility, when the execution (a transferable token given primarily based on usage and repeated usage) is far from the ideal option if that were the case. Anyway, even if it were the case that this was solely intended as a governance (non-financial) distribution\u2026 then selling is still not even bad. Sellers are also helping transfer voting power into the hands of those likely to use it, too. The coins that would be ignored end up in the hands of people who actually want them. Don\u2019t see how that is a bad thing. Plus, just because you sold in the past, does not mean you will sell in the future. People\u2019s situations change a lot and Optimism can change a lot. Being excluded from all future governance rights because you sold in 2022 seems silly very quickly as Optimism changes and time passes. ",

I would vote against the proposal to backlist users from future airdrops if it ever came up. However\u2026 Your argument seems to boil down to the idea that despite the claim that the primary reason for the token is governance, you just know that it\u2019s primary purpose is really to stimulate growth. If that were the case then why would so much of the allocation of Airdrop One have gone to activities that don\u2019t in any way relate to the use of Optimism. Out of the 6 categories you could get 4 of them without having touched the rollup\u2026 how does participating in the BanklessDAO\u2019s governance or donating to The Daily Gwei\u2019s Gitcoin funding round affect growth of Optimism? Doesn\u2019t is seem plausible that these criteria were chosen specifically because they are likely to correlate to users more likely than average to participate in Optimism\u2019s vision? If they wanted to optimimze for attracting growth then surely it would have made a lot more sense to airdrop to users of mainnet dApps like UniSwap and Synthetix that are also available on Optimism, these are users who would very easily be convinced to start using optimism and are likely to stay due to the much cheaper fees than they are used to. I think you\u2019re so used to the cynical behavior of many projects in crypto that you\u2019re making a category error and assuming that all token airdrops must fit into the same simple motivation.     cobie:  Plus, just because you sold in the past, does not mean you will sell in the future. People\u2019s situations change a lot and Optimism can change a lot.   Points like this I think should be irrelevant from the perspective of OP issuance. The issue isn\u2019t a value judgement on why people sell or whether it\u2019s \u2018bad\u2019 to do so. It\u2019s just about the practical question of how to get more voting power into the hands of those who will use it than those who won\u2019t. Of course you can give it to people who will just sell it and then those more interested in governance can just buy it\u2026 but that seems like an inefficient extra step. [Edit - spelling] ",

So, non-users received 30% and users received 70%. Of the other categories, you can probably infer them all as governance participants. Gitcoin donors are probably seen as ecosystem supporters, and it\u2019s good marketing/growth to align yourself with other public goods. Multisig signers are likely developers, builders, or active community members. They\u2019re probably governance-biased, but attracting developers and builders seems the most important motive here. DAO voters are of course directly governance participants. In total, they received the smallest amount of any of the groups. ",

The OP ignores the massive awareness campaign this brought not only to Optimism but to bridges and governance participation and so forth. And with it a tail of educational and usage network effects. For example, the \u2018alpha\u2019 channel discussions amongst NFT natives was quite telling: \u201cis this Optimism thing legit?\u201d, \u201cwhat is Optimism, is it on ETH?\u201d, \u201chow do i bridge and what bridge should i use\u201d, \u201chow do i swap? \u2026what is uniswap\u201d, \u201cwait, you got more because you [participated in governance]\u201d, \u201care there NFTs there?\u201d, \u201cgas is how much?!\u201d, and so forth. Little by little people start to figure it out: knowledge and participation pays. And little by little awareness and usage grows and network effects start to take hold. So when that easy-sauce Coinbase bridge appears, they\u2019ll already know what Optimism is. And, heck, they might even come back and tell their frens to buy your bags. Disclosure: I am an airdrop seller. Almost every time. But the non-vampires come from early participation in networks or projects that I continue to use. Pre and post-drop I\u2019m engaging NFT degens and others, answering their questions and of course giving them my opinion. But, according to OP, I am a zero contribution account. Begs the question: is this post real or a figment of your imagination? ",

Distribute governance power.  There will be users of Optimism who do not want to participate in governance. As long as the goals of the airdrop remain as the above, sellers should not be excluded. Given the two house system of Optimism, it is actually better suited to include sellers in future airdrops as not all governance decisions will be made through token voting and citizenship can have more stringent requirements and exclusions.

Should we examine each individual\u2019s choice for why they participate in crypto to begin with?  Examine why each individual interacts with apps on Optimism and then decide whether their motivations are pure or not?  Should I also be banned because I sold 200 of my 7500 OP to buy an NFT (on Optimism by the way)? OP will eventually make its way to the people who want to participate in governance and contribute meaningfully to the community.  If we start punishing people or banning them for wanting to improve their financial situation then we have taken a moral wrong turn.  If Optimism is about distributing punishment then I might need to leave. ",

In crypto community, airdrops are usually aimed at big volume traders and the small guy is almost always termed as an airdrop farmer and left out. I hate that. I thank the optimism team for not doing that and that is what increases my trust in the project by many folds. Not every small investor is an airdrop farmer. The point can be clearly seen by looking at the accounts who sell their $OP and who don\u2019t sell. Why are the people who got the largest amount of airdrop and dump it, not called airdrop farmers? People like me, who get small allocation of $OP have a very good reason to sell $OP and get some much needed money. So, if they are not selling their $OP, that says something about their trust in the project and community. So, yes I think that optimism should keep that in mind moving forward and restrict the future airdrops to Hodlers and not the ACTUAL AIRDROP FARMERS who already have a lot of money and get huge chunks of airdrop and sell it to tank the project.

Someone who sell all on a DEX, buys ETH and bridges ETH over to Optimistic and tries all their protocols. All the gas fees on Optimistic is in ETH and not OP. Value is being added into the Optimistic.   If everyone keeps their OP and not sell, then a Whale can just sit and wait for the price to hit $10 for instance and sell. We small fishes will die when this happens.   Everyone has their own reasons to do what they want. They put effort into getting the airdrop and those sybils were also eliminated by the OP Team. For those who do not have so much funds from 3rd world countries struggling to get back from the pandemic, this is a good income for them to survive. Not everyone is rich and wealthy. Many of us got into crypto because we did\u2019nt have any jobs during the pandemic and this was one way to make ends meet. ",

I really like the idea of either adjusting the vesting or changing the way these wallets get to interact with the ecosystem though as the instadump is nothing more then a way for them to extract more value for themselves. That being said there has to be a better approach then to just cut someone off completely.

Reason 1 - Perception. Optimism is not only competitng with other layer 2s on a technological basis but also on a narrative basis. The fact this is so devise and also has had a heavyweight from Crypto Twitter jump in and slam it in a satirical manner in Cobie shows how bad implementing this would be from a PR point of view. Reason 2 - Freedom Crypto was designed to set us free, in a free market people should be able to buy and sell whatever they like. Selling is still a legitimate economic activity that has brought value to Optimism. These users have chosen to sell for whatever reason, however who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t buy back at some point. The airdrop was rewarding positive activity in both Ethereum and Optimism so these users have brought value and have the potential to bring further value to Optimism, putting up barriers when layer 2s are wanting to entice users seems counterproductive. Reason 3 - Centralization Risks We all want decentralization in Ethereum, and by blacklisting legitimate users who tick off criteria to be determined in the future because they decided to sell all/some of their first airdrop risks us seeing centralization within the $OP holders very early on. I would not be adverse to a multiplier being applied for users who hodled if this was to be voted on, but to actively punish users who sold seems to me to be a very counterproductive measure as we try and grow the Optimism ecosystem.

I mean, you are saying that even if banning is the correct path here, no other L2 platform should do this because it would be bad PR. This is nonsense, Optimism should make an example by barring these wallets from receiving additional rewards even if this decision would potentially harm people\u2019s view of the collective. For the Freedom argument,  I would disagree with that on the design purpose of crypto. What crypto provides is the means to acquire a different political field. And it does this on the premises of decentralization and openness (of code, of the transactions etc.). It provides the means to detach people from the grasp of authoritarian organizations such as the state and corporations. What we should do with crypto is not to re-enact oppressive structures, and certainly not \u201cfree market\u201d. On the contrary, we should use blockchain to utterly destroy them. There is no freedom when there is a \u201cfree market\u201d in the conventional sense. Yes, there is no guarantee that people would not buy back OP in the future, but it is the act of selling itself that is discussed here, not the people\u2019s intentions or inner thoughts or whatnot. Also, there is nothing keeping people from contributing to the collective even if they are banned from the airdrops. For the concerns about Centralization Risks, It is not realistic to think that opting for the ban would compromise the collective to centralization by itself. Wallets under the risk of being banned are a very small fraction of airdrop receivers. Promoting decentralization should not mean allowing everybody to have equal ground regardless of their benefit or harm to Optimism\u2019s premises. ",

If we could also block all IP addresses from accessing Optimism as well that have ever sold in the past six months, along with the wallet addresses. It is likely that punishing these users for selling by not allowing them in airdrops will reach the same end result as blocking them but we should just be 100% sure. All Optimism users should be mandated also to vote or delegate or be punished as well. All protocols should only allow buying on optimism, and should be linked directly to bridges so the protocols only sell tokens directly from L1 or other L2\u2019s. Also slashing should be implemented as well for all sellers of all tokens. We should definitely publicly post all wallet addresses who sell tokens to publicly ridicule them too. John has started this thankfully, so we need only add to the list. Good work. Using protocols and being an active user of Optimism should count for nothing, ZERO. It should be mandatory that any and all airdrops on Optimism have a TEN YEAR VESTING PERIOD. After the vesting period, tokens will be released to users, but they will have to sign a contract agreeing to drive a stake into their own beating heart if they consider selling, swapping, pooling, profiting, transferring to another wallet, wrapping, or bridging. Protocols should be blacklisted for any type of rewards, as it is basically the same as selling for $0 dollars. In fact, generally commerce in general involves someone selling something to obtain something else. Commerce should generally be banned and punished with airdrop blacklisting, slashing, ip blocking, wallet blocking, and stake driving. Please, feel free to add more ways to punish, blacklist, stifle, chase off, block, hurt, cancel, destroy, decimate, eviscerate, ravage, annihilate, and decimate sellers. SELLERS will not be allowed here on Optimism, and we will let them know it. We need to be EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE here guys. That means EXCLUDING PEOPLE TO THE EXTREME. It is the only way to truly attract the people we want here. It does not matter at all that we will discourage people who sold anything ever, even for a moment for profit and even 1 token because THESE PEOPLE are certainly one of the following: -poor/ financially not good (we certainly want to punish the poor and oust them) -traders -poolers -defi users -recently rekt by the bear market -uninterested -scared of losing money -needed money to put in optimism protocols -sick and had medical bills -dumpers -in debt -just a bad person -dirty degens -clean degens -apes -got scared when price dropped on launch -didn\u2019t see the available use cases appealing -SUPER poor -\u201cdon\u2019t believe\u201d in voting -thought it was \u201cOK\u201d to sell their personal tokens (note: they were wrong) -had to deposit to stop a liquidation on an optimism protocol -needed money to donate on gitcoin (donation is a form of selling for $0 and is condemned here) -and just pure evil STAND TOGETHER OPTIMISM COMMUNITY. Together we can clear out ANYONE WE DEEM UNWORTHY. Eventually we will be left with the select few\u2026 the proud\u2026 the perfect holders. In 50 years when quantum computers have effectively depreciated the internet and 99.99% of the perfect holders have died of natural causes, staking, decimation, and general whatnot we will be left with one.

If some wallets dumped their OP tokens then let them, I\u2019m sure if you didn\u2019t dump you\u2019ll probably get a multiplier for the next airdrops. Some people probably don\u2019t have the time or understanding to participate in quality governance so they sell their tokens. Also what if they sold their OP to provide liquidity, make transactions within Optimism or test out other dapps with funds provided from the OP airdrop! Even if they bridged their funds to another ecosystem who cares, that is what our buddies at HOP protocol rely on. Punishing people for making their own decisions is not the answer, just give a bigger reward to those who contribute more. May peace be with you. ",

Good liquidity is needed in the secondary market. A market without liquidity would be catastrophic for op. Good liquidity comes from a lot of buying and a lot of selling. So there must be sellers. The people we should punish are the ones who go through the contract to claim the airdrop (wallet address). Their actions are causing panic in the community. The team should not be overly concerned about the price of op. It should focus on the governance of the op system. op governance is still in the early days. The team\u2019s view is crucial to op development The team should be careful what they say. the size of the op airdrop is unprecedented. more than 200,000 wallet addresses, but this is does not mean that there are 200,000 or so real people, right? It\u2019s too normal for each person to have a few wallet addresses. Although let\u2019s do a witch exclusion. But only a portion of the exclusion. what the op community needs is dynamic growth. There are new people entering the op ecosystem and old people exiting the op ecosystem. As long as the amount of entry is greater than the amount of exit, it proves that the op ecosystem is growing, right?  ",

I believe a balanced view can be achieved in line with the suggestion by @polynya where long term holders become eligible for a multiplier. If its Optimism\u2019s goal that tokens need cannot be sold, then they could have issued soul-bound NFTs instead of tokens. On the contrary, Optimism has chosen to go with 2 tier governance model -  the Optimism Citizen\u2019s House will comprise of members who can vote on governance but cannot sell their NFTs, while the Token House members will be free to do what they want with their tokens. This creates a liquid market for Optimism tokens. Also one of the major goals for Optimism Collective is to fund public goods. Projects in the sphere can be funded properly only if they are able to sell their tokens. For example, let us say Optimism Collective funds a Optimism Analytics Dashboard with 100,000 OP tokens. For the project to benefit from the funding, they will need to pay for expenses, pay for employees etc with these OP tokens. This will invariably involve selling a portion of OP tokens. Allowing people to sell their OP tokens without any artificially imposed \u201chodl mode\u201d creates a free market for the tokens, which can be beneficial for the project. ",

I think a more constructive outlook would be to actually explore locked airdrops after a certain size. I think if larger accounts get their share but have a vesting and release could be accelerated based on net positive contribution, this would actually encrourage people to participate and may be even stay even after thier tokens are unlocked.

What I\u2019d do instead is not to punish \u201cbad actors\u201d but reward good actors. It is so much easier to make a whitelist than to make a blacklist. Just reward those people disproportionally who did these things for example:  Held onto $OP Delegated to someone or was active in governance Used tool x, y or z since the airdrop etc\u2026  This whole thing was blown out of proportion. Let them sell. Make a list of people who you want to reward, not a list of people you hate. Also\u2026the criteria for the first airdrop was less then ideal. For example I should have been eligible for \u201cpriced out of Ethereum\u201d since I\u2019ve been using L2s for a very long time, but there was a limit, so only whales got rewarded. I have also been using Gnosis, but I didn\u2019t match that criteria either (I didn\u2019t check but probably because I\u2019m not a whale). The initial distribution wasn\u2019t something that I would call fair. ",

They were indentified specifically by Optimism and rewarded so handsomely because they were already determined to be good stewards and valuable contributors to the same values as those held by Optimism. It\u2019s literally why they got so much $OP. Meanwhile, the vast majority couldn\u2019t even claim until the price had tanked 50% and you want to fault them for selling? I see absolutely nothing wrong with selling something you believe in; if you see things falling off a cliff. You stil want to get back in but are you supposed to take a bullet for Optimism? Of course not. And for myself, I LPed $OP - meaning I sold some $OP for $USDC so that I could add liquidity on Velodrome and also Uniswap - does this active participation mean I should also be labeled as anti-Optimism. Again, of course not - LPing is engaging productively in a new ecosystem in one of the most supportive ways possible. This feels more like a witch hunt then anything else. Which is what the entire past couple months have felt like to be blunt with all the \u201csybil attackers\u201d and other nonsense that has consumed so much time. Hundreds of applications could have been built and deployed to Optimism with time spent ticking boxes and this is not how I envision a decentralized and prosperous Collective to function; not in the least. For the sake of everyone, I would suggest just drop it. Don\u2019t airdrop such large amounts to relatively few people. Move forward and support the ecosystem so that it doesn\u2019t implode like we all watched Fantom do with drama quite similar to this in nature. Felt compelled to share some thoughts here - the time you spent researching could have been spent building some awesome Dashboards on Dune and the time I spent writing this I could have been setting up sweet new markets on Exotic Markets etc. Don\u2019t mean to be too negative either here; I understand the points being made. I\u2019d just continue to point out: big picture. To thrive; there is not enough bandwidth then 100% focus by all involved here on bringing assets and talent to Optimism. Period. Weston Nelson ",

Technically it would be swapping OP tokens to meet the pool balance\u2026 So it would be tough to weed out who actually held\u2026 2nd, this amount of money is SO different to people in different parts of the world and in far diff. economic situations. Very possible for somebody to be a huge supporter of Optimism, weigh in and help w governance, participate in all positive ways, but holding ~3,000 USD worth of one coin is just a HUGE amount of money. To others w greater financial standing, it may seem like a drop in their bucket and they could easily hold w hopes of qualifying for the next airdrops w the intent of dumping still. TLDR: I like the thought but needs a bit more work to do it properly. ",

So from that point penalising someone for using their own money for their own purpose is really against values, mision and vision of Satoshi in the first place.   We will ban accounts from receiving new airdrops, but what will stop these people of making other accounts and receive airdrop from different account?   Try to think - Is this proposal driven by common good, or only by our individual anger, because token ins dumping on price because of this actions?   I think we should more think about how to engage people not to sell token in future. And this must be personal need of every person. So token need to have some function or value, which will give people will not to sell it at all.   Gas payments: Change the use of OP tokens from a governance token to the main network token for gas payment   Some other incentive in voting or for example some badges in community. I dont know how, just giving creative question.   Discounts on different dApps for using or hodling OP token.   Better yields for holding some amount of token (for example something like BNB on Binance VIP).   So in total I would focus energy not to slash addresses, but create ideas how to keep people of selling tokens. I we need to remember, that crypto is financial area and people will always want to get benefit of it. Thats why Satoshi vision is so great, because every participant in network is benefiting of it.

This proposal would benefit the Optimism community. The largest reason is that holders can be fit into two camps (poor traders and optimism fanatics). As a community, we need to look out financially for these two groups in order to keep the network users in good morale. Additionally, there will almost certainly be future liquidity mining campaigns will provide OP yield opportunities for early dumpers provided they remain in the ecosystem. Just for elucidation, those who did not sell are poor traders because the FDV was 5.5 billion. The entire global asset market is in contraction and safer and higher yields are possible outside of defi. Additionally, almost all airdrops are \u201cDown Only.\u201d Futhermore, there is not currently any staking mechanism or collateral opportunities to utilize OP. It would be wise to expect that large investors were shorting OP immediately. ",

Let\u2019s imagine what happens when BTC is held only by all \u201cbelievers\u201d and stays permanently in the miner\u2019s address after it has been mined? The changing of hands of assets is the transfer of consensus from one body to another. This transfer is akin to Darwinian evolution, where the good and valuable are always embraced by the market and pursued and agreed upon by all. What is the point of consensus if optimism relies on compulsory lock-in airdrops to maintain \u201cprice\u201d and \u201cconsensus\u201d? How is it different from banning your people from leaving the country and proving that they are patriotic by doing so? I\u2019m not selling my OP, but I\u2019m not proud of that behaviour. I just recognise it relatively more and I would be more willing to use our development to attract more people to become holders like me rather than by punishing. People suffer the consequences for their choices, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can threaten to get everyone on our side. Consensus is like a river that flows only to the most suitable place and ignores the king and his army on the shore. It is like love, you can never force anyone to really love you by any means. ",

The effects of this proposal are to inflate OP price over the airdrop period, after which there will be a cliff as airdrop receivoooors dump en masse. You\u2019re never going to avoid the tendency of users to sell their airdrops \u2013 and this shouldn\u2019t be looked down upon; especially when the value of the airdrop is a significant portion of some user\u2019s crypto portfolio. Importantly, those who sold their tokens before a proposal like this passes are likely to have their opinion about the protocol permanently sullied. Not good for adoption. Another byproduct is that it suppresses other users\u2019 ability to accumulate OP over the airdrop period by artificially supporting the price. This means relative latecomers to the community will have an opportunity to achieve outsize influence by waiting for the post-airdrop dumps to fill their bags. All in all, I think it\u2019s better not to adopt this idea. And if it is adopted, I think it should be applied as a percentage penalty to the tokens received, as opposed to complete disqualification. ",

I\u2019m sharing my perspective so that you might consider a little grace. I am just now coming to a full understanding of the governance and public good space. I had no idea, all of my people were on this side of the blockchain.  When I got my OP drop, I held it for a bit but sold it because I didn\u2019t have a deep enough understanding of the culture or the mechanics of your work. About 6 weeks ago, worn out from the NFT space, I took some time off. I was working with 40 Acres Dao during their Gitcoin grant round and my head popped completely off!  Immediately I dove110% into the studying what everyone is doing here. I am gifted at onboarding and educating people because of these challenges because it takes me a little longer to wrap my head around everything. I love being in and around communities like OP. It\u2019s inspiring and gives me hope again. I just paid some big bills and buying back my coins back isn\u2019t possible right now, especially because I\u2019ve struggled to monetize all the work I love the most. I don\u2019t know the solution because the points are more than fair.  There is so much shallow greed in crypto but there has to be others like me who just needed more time. I\u2019m ready to lie in the bed that I made, but felt it was important to point out that OP could potentially be missing out on some valuable members. Appreciate your time. Trish. ",

Hi Trish, I\u2019m glad to hear your story. This is what OP airdrop was about, to bring people like you to this community. I think the best we all can do is to forget about future airdrops and start building and participating. The best we can get here aren\u2019t OP token, but learning and having the opportunity to share with great people. Welcome, and I hope to hear from you around. ",

I sold most of it inside the blockchain, transferred it to USDC. But thanks to this drop, I have the means to live in the Aptos blockchain, I have a start-up capital specifically in Aptos. Thanks to this, I studied almost all the products in the ecosystem, collected a collection of NFTs, and participated in tokensales. I am also an active member of the forum, I have many OG roles in their products. In general, I use the ecosystem 100%. And the whole drop did not leave the system, the coins remained and are used internally. Therefore, if the recipient of the drop withdraws tokens from the blockchain, then this is bad, of course, but if he exchanged them for other tokens inside and continues to live within the ecosystem, then this is good. Why didn\u2019t many people withdraw tokens from Aptos after the drop? Because there will be a second part of the drop, and no one knows for what exactly. They test everything they can, buy up all the tokens and NFTs in a row to get another drop. Motivation. And while they are doing this, time passes, and they, as users, get used to the ecosystem, get to know every corner, create a comfort zone for themselves. When they receive the second drop, most of them will not leave here, because they have penetrated and studied all the products, it is easy and quick for them to navigate. You have to get used to the new. Optimism - accustom to the good! ",

But i do disagree, what if owners of these wallets want to trade with their tokens to create for themselves a greater position in OP, are they not allowed to trade without being excluded from furter aidrops even if they meet the criterias? What if they are in need of some liquidity and will be forced to sell? How can u know about these things just from looking at their activity onchain? U can not exclude these wallets imo, and also trading is healthy for the ecosystem. I do understand your point but i think it will be a very unfair way going forward. ",
