In theory a new account can be created and apart to post throttling this individual (or bot) could create offboardings for every single core unit all of which have to go to vote. It is my opinion that due to the severity of this action we should have a minimal level of Sybil protection. Spam submissions haven\u2019t happened yet, but they likely will especially as conflicts in the DAO heat up under bear market conditions. I would like to get ahead of this by proposing a modest threshold to submit a facilitator offboarding requiring posting 1 MKR. If the proposal succeeds then the user gets their MKR back, if it fails the MKR is forfeit. This will result in the user having to post financial stake to begin the offboarding process. The stake is low enough that if truly desired offboardings are there it is not hard to surmount and likely the user will get their MKR back. On the other hand this will prevent spam submissions from clogging up the governance process.  Amended MIPs and Components This MIP4c2 subproposal revises MIP41 as well as related subcomponents MIP41c5.  Amendment Pull Request   github.com/makerdao/mips         Add 1 MKR requirement for Facilitator Offboarding   makerdao:master \u2190 hexonaut:MIP41-modification            opened 08:13PM - 03 Jul 22 UTC               hexonaut             +14 -0       This makes the voluntary offboarding language more clear, adds a 1 MKR requireme\u2026nt for offboarding along with a bypass via Signal Request.  https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip4c2-spxx-mip41-facilitator-offboarding-amendment/16297        Relevant Information ",

It also goes against the notion that we evaluate proposals based on merit because it gates proposals behind the ability to put 1MKR at risk. Maintaining obligations is one of my core values and I don\u2019t want us to wantonly off board neither CUs nor facilitators. Nor do I want governance to get jammed by requests for off-boarding because lone individuals want to settle scores. To try to reconcile those differences I suggest an additional clause to this proposal. \u201cThe requirement of 1 MKR is waived if the suggestion has passed a signal request prior to being introduced as an MIP.\u201d ",

If a bunch of well-written, hand crafted MIPs came in to offboard every core unit all at once, would @GovAlpha-Core-Unit block this? My guess is no, but I\u2019ll let them answer.   To confirm, if properly submitted (following Request for Comments rules on timing, in the correct format that our MIP editor would assist with etc.) we would allow the proposals to enter the voting cycle. MIPs are the rules MKR holders vote in for us to enforce, so unless there\u2019s something passed making the action forbidden it\u2019s our duty to allow the community to vote on it, absent a severe danger to the protocol in promoting such a vote. It is often a difficult situation for CUs that have been the subject of an offboarding proposal, but we try to emphasize that it is the merit of the argument that should be focused on. The identity of the person seeking to offboard is pretty irrelevant, as if they have known supporters (people that will vote with their name in favor of an offboarding proposal) the proposal could just be forked and run by one of the supporting delegates.  Perhaps this is a problem (lower barrier to demand CUs justify their existence than the effort it takes for CUs to defend themselves from malicious offboarding), and this amendment addresses  part of that cost. Ultimately that\u2019s what we should be discussing, what problem does this address and is it the best solution to that problem. Appreciate the initiative to start that discussion with this proposal @hexonaut and happy to answer any other Governance interpretation questions. ",

While I don\u2019t have a problem with offboarding if it is desired by a majority. My problem is that it\u2019s not clear this is what is desired for a 2 month RFC+wait+vote period. This leaves the CU in uncertain limbo of whether they have jobs in 2 months. In the case of events they were actively scouting venues for DevCon. Should they continue scouting? Who knows? I actually like this signal request idea better the more I think of it because it gives quick/advanced clarity that token holders are likely to follow through with the offboarding and avoids financial stake which I agree is not optimal. @JustinCase @Doo_StableLab + other delegates - would you prefer I remove the 1 MKR clause and just keep the requirement to an advanced signal request passing?

It seems weird if you look at it abstractly, but I can provide concrete example of how this will help with reference to the current Events offboarding:  Status Quo Anyone can initiate an offboarding proposal which has very real consequences for long term planning. The Events team is actively scouting a venue for DevCon, and if the offboarding is successful then they will only be able to cover 75% of the budget for that event. Downpayments are required months in advance. Should they continue scouting the venue? This is unclear because we do not know the likelyhood of the offboarding proceeding until mid-August. The observation is it requires barely any effort to essentially cause effects worth $60k+.  Fast-fail Signal Request By including a faster temperature check we get a much stronger likelyhood indicator in a 2 week span vs the 2 month AND the CUs still can defend themselves. If the SR passes then the CU should start preparing for offboarding by cancelling long term plans. If it fails well we know this quickly and can continue working. ",

The trouble with making a poll a requirement and the only path is that it can become a way to block MKR holders from enacting a wanted change. I think we need to recognize that CU members and MKR holders may not have aligned incentives in all cases and in particular in off-boarding cases. Off-boarding should not be a quick and easy process but it should not be possible to keep away from a vote if a sufficient number of MKR backs the idea. ",

The only thing that could make an impact is if new information comes to light, and then that information would first be transparently processed in the DVCs.   I\u2019m not sure why DVCs will be able to formulate clear positions on which CUs they are for or against when the community/delegates aren\u2019t close to doing so today (as seen with Events and other recent issues where the community and delegates both do 180-degree turns). Also, what does it mean for information to be \u201ctransparently processed\u201d in DVCs\u2026? How is this different to how information is processed by the community across the forum, Discord and calls today? I\u2019ve set out more questions about DVCs here: The Endgame Plan part 3: The Endgame Decentralized Workforce - #4 by Matt_NZ I am certainly not against DVCs but given how central they are to the Endgame plan I am keen to understand how they will address our existing problems and how tough situations (ie disagreement as to how DVCs are constituted, what happens when DVCs disagree) will be resolved.
