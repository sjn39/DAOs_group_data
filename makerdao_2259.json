I reference a post from June, just under a year ago\u2026  image1284\u00d71829 133 KB    Nikolai I highlighted the urgency of getting out of USDC - ASAP, using BUSD as holdover during transition. Was this my own original idea? No. It was Nikolai\u2019s, he was able to see into the future\u2026 maybe too far for his own good.  What now? Approximately exactly zero efforts to address the situation we\u2019re facing now have been taken since. BUSD is not some magic saintly collateral immune to default. Its risk profile is about the same as USDC. DAI\u2019s. current depeg, was was entirely avoidable. Come Monday, will Circle recapitalize?@PaperImperium has some hope. I do too. But, whether we reclaim peg or not, celebrate all you want if it does, but DAI\u2019s reputation is now publicly tarnished forever. Black Thursday was a true black swan. It was a hard time, but we got thru it. This was not a black swan. The fact that we allowed this to happen is an embarrassment.  Continuing the discussion from [Signal Request] Immediately Onboard BUSD & Introduce 0% PSM:    [Signal Request] Immediately Onboard BUSD & Introduce 0% PSM     >80% of DAI is backed by USDC. USDC may or may not be compromised.  Surprisingly, large players have been mismanaging customer funds, going under, and defaulting. It is feasible that Circle may have mismanaged USDC.     80% of DAI is backed by USDC.   A potential default could be imminent. This would be an existential risk to DAI.    Immediately onboard BUSD as collateral.  BUSD will be a temporary alternative to phase out USDC or at least diversify the risk of single collateral defaulting.    ",
