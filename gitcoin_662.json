Screen_Shot_2022-01-14_at_10.08.20_AM_720x720\u00d7916 78 KB  Here\u2019s what the book is about:  This book is about cryptoeconomic systems that create positive externalities for their neighbors & for the world. We explore the intersection of programmable money, game theory, & mechanism design. We search for powerful new ways to to fund, design, develop, & market regenerative web3-era applications and digital assets. We launch the meme of regenerative crypto-economics into the world.   Foreword from GitcoinDAO As part of the book, I\u2019m having a handful of members of the web3 regen community write forewords, and I\u2019d like to include \u201cGitcoinDAO\u201d on that list as well. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got drafted up:  Our vision is to establish an empowering, open and collaborative space where individuals and communities can access resources in proportion to their value creation independent of their geographic location, education, background or offline identity. By creating collaborative, decentralized funding mechanisms, Gitcoin has become the natural choice for seeding and supporting digital public goods. The DAO enables building for the public, by the public by helping individuals and communities start, fund, and scale open source projects. We are the EVM whisperers, the DAO cartographers, the internet citizens, and the chaos magicians of the internet of money. We are the schelling point for the hopeful . We are still discovering new & innovative ways to solve coordination problems in a DAO-era world. We systematically discover or invent these mechanisms, and if we\u2019re lucky + good, we then scale them.  Astute readers of this forum may note that the first two paragraphs are pulled from this thread on mission/values which was authored by @Pop (but synthesized bits from many many community members) and the second two paragraphs are from the what is gitcoin post that I authored. Here is how it looks in the layout.  101755\u00d72214 128 KB   111755\u00d72211 224 KB  I would like to solicit feedback on the above content. What do people think?  Should we include a GitcoinDAO Foreword in the 0th edition of this book? Who even has the legitimacy to author a statement on behalf of the DAO? Does the fact that these posts have been up on the forum for months + have already solicited comments imbue legitimacy, or can legitimacy only come from the formal governance process? Maybe a middle ground would be to ship this book with a statement about GitcoinDAO instead of from GitcoinDAO?  ",

If a person is already part of the DAO, then they would already have every right to write something in their name, but since it is a community of people, all of whom are included, then there must be a certain degree of acceptance that is denoted in the reactions of the forums or RRSS, it depends on what you have written. If it is already legitimate, since many people participated with comments or corrections, then you already have the acceptance that you mentioned in point 2. (We will never agree 100% on everything, but the idea is to reach an acceptable percentage ). Since the whole community is here reading this, then you can now send it from GitcoinDAO.  These words are only an opinion I hope I have served you, have a good day. ",

For me, the second paragraph does describe what I believe, and the following two are good, if somewhat whimsical. But I\u2019m not a fan of the first one, simply because it is formulated ambiguously, between \u2018in proportion\u2019, \u2018their value\u2019 and \u2018their geographic location\u2019. And we found out since Sept that locations do matter\u2026 An organization does not have a \u2018voice\u2019, in the sense of not having a corporeal physical existence, but it can certainly have a speaker. There is no doubt that for Gitcoin, beyond being the founder, you are the visionary and the speaker. Still, foundational statements made on behalf of the DAO could be further confirmed as accurate and representative through some form of a referendum or a process of ratification. ",

I also really like that you pulled from existing material, and that these materials have largely been discussed before. One personal preference of note, I dont love this:     owocki:  communities can access resources in proportion to their value creation   It feels exclusionary and as if we are only offer these resources to those who create value. I would love to think we are offering these tools to dreamers, dabblers, value creators and critics alike. We as a community are stronger by incorporating the best of what works, sharing our learnings and discarding what doesn\u2019t. Gitcoin of yesterday will look different from Gitcoin of today. I would like to believe we have something to offer all who seek to understand. So, one humble suggestion:  Our vision is to establish an empowering, open and collaborative space where individuals and communities can access resources independent of their geographic location, education, background or offline identity.  I would also strike \u201cdigital\u201d from the second paragraph as we are already moving into real life public goods as evidenced by GR12. Third paragraph has a space at the end (near the period) that shouldn\u2019t be there (it does not look like this space is in the proof you shred though). Final paragraph, perhaps use: \u201cWe will continue to discover\u2026\u201d as we opened with \u201cwe are\u2026\u201d in the paragraph above. This will able maintain the tense for the second sentence in that paragraph. In the second sentence, consider changing discover to uncover as we used discover in the first sentence . ",

I would love to think we are offering these tools to dreamers, dabblers, value creators and critics alike   Thanks for the thoughtful commentary Kyle! This is a great point, and forces some thinking about our values and hard tradeoffs to be made. Here is my 002 wei.  Open to others feedback! On one hand, I believe that being as inclusive as possible is important.  It is not the fault of the underprivileged or under-resourced that they were born into where they were, and we should make every effort to be as inclusive as possible. On the other hand, I feel like the north star mission is to \u201cbuild and fund the public good\u201d.  If we are not prioritizing the people who are providing value to the public good, then how are we to accomplish this mission? Perhaps a middle ground is to have a baseline amount of resources available to everyone (Gitcoin\u2019s code, its lore, its culture, its governance model), but then have some resources (eg the matching pool) that are only available to those who are creating value for the public good.

Absolutely +1 on this, although I agree with @kyle that we should say Gitcoin, it\u2019s really one core community, and we\u2019re all on the same mission in different ways.   Who even has the legitimacy to author a statement on behalf of the DAO?   I think it might be a bit late if we really want the whole DAO to have input depending on when we need to bring this to press, but it could always be something that\u2019s included and iterated on for V1 as well.   Does the fact that these posts have been up on the forum for months + have already solicited comments imbue legitimacy, or can legitimacy only come from the formal governance process?   I think most of the points here definitely reflect all the conversations folks have had in Public Goods Funding, and so from that perspective I think it\u2019s the right vibe.   Maybe a middle ground would be to ship this book with a statement about GitcoinDAO instead of from GitcoinDAO?   I don\u2019t know if this is truly distinct, whether we say it about or from the DAO it represents the DAO and I think our position on the degree to which this represents everyone\u2019s views should be the deciding factor on either way of wording things.
