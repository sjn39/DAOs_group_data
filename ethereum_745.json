Summary Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and other PoW-coins need an agreed and clear voting/signaling workflow before the next difficult decisions occur. This paper proposes a voting/signaling concept that can be developed and implemented in a short period of time and on a low budget. The system divides the key stakeholders of PoW-coin\u2019s Network into 3 branches(separation of powers):  Core Developers(Contributors). Those who actually creating underlying software and technology used in Network. Coin Holders. Those who invested own fiat money thus bought coins and holding it now. Miners. Those who securing PoW network.  Agreed acceptance criteria for Referendum it is any TWO of branches passing representation threshold and gain more than 50% of YES votes for Referendum proposal.

A less charitable way to view this is that any two branches, if in majority agreement, can compel action by the third branch, even if it is against the third branch\u2019s majority agreement. The reason I chose the less charitable phrasing was to illustrate the main conflict: how to incentivize a \u201cbranch\u201d to a unified action when their majority opinion is against it.  Realistically miners and developers cannot compel coin holders to act one way if they don\u2019t want to, or for any other majority branch against a minority branch.  The minority branch always has the option of walking away/forking and taking the minority of those other two branches to form their own coin.  Even a three way minority can do that too. (ETC?) My opinion is that unless there is fairly uniform agreement between the three branches in this model that any non-unified change would then be contentions.  Only a change that would be in agreement to all three branches would work long term, so it would be better to spend time persuading the minority branch to act than compelling any action by any branch.

When I\u2019ve been thinking about signaling, I\u2019ve avoided defining thresholds in order to keep the signals \u201csignals\u201d rather than votes. Determining that 51% simple majority is the way to go creates further arguments for delegitimizing such votes, such as, if 51% miners say AYE, and 49% say NAY, will this cause a network split or will the entire population accept the validity of the vote? Such a result will not signal that \u201crough consensus\u201d has been reached, and therefore no \u201cwinner\u201d should be determined. On a completely separate note, we should have a note on coin-voting precedent, using the DAO carbon vote as an example:  DAO Carbon vote finished at block 1,894,000 http://v1.carbonvote.com/  Supply at block 1,894,000 (July 20th, 2016) was around 82,000,000 https://etherscan.io/chart/ethersupplygrowth  Turnout was 4,542,416.51 ETH, amounting to around 5.54% of total ETH supply AYEs got 87%  \u2026 Result was 97% market cap remaining with ETH, and 3% market cap with ETC. It was however, a different time with a much more concentrated community and distribution of ETH. Also, market cap is not an ideal metric, but in my opinion, the best we have for the health of a network and determining the success of a chain after a chain split. ",
