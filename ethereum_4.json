That may be cut down to just 2 days or otherwise have short days. Oct 30th is \u201cday 0\u201d for DevCon4 which will mainly be registration day there. Oct 28th is last day of the Status hackathon. @JosefJ and his company Polynom are acting as our Host Organization on the ground and has a tentative venue that should fit up to 150 people. Unlike Berlin, the core will not only be unconference style. Ring Makers and EIP authors will be invited to set aside chunks of time (2 - 3 hours) to work together in moving issues forward. This also is very specifically different than content at DevCon \u2013 we gather to make progress on EIPs/ERCs. This may be pair programming, plugfests for interoperability testing, whiteboarding, circle discussions, or anything else that moves towards running code and rough consensus. @jpitts & @gcolvin will be submitting a proposal to talk about FEM at DevCon as well, as part of getting more people involved. We will be announcing a call for volunteers (as in, an actual live call) \u2013 if you want to get involved please leave a comment below or PM me and we\u2019ll make sure you get a call invite. Basic details:  Website: https://ethereumevents.global/events/2018-council-of-prague/  Registration: https://www.picatic.com/ethmagicians-prague-2018 \u2013 waitlist right now while we finalize details Wiki Agenda: https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Council-of-Prague-Agenda \u2013 please edit and start gathering your rings  ",

If people want to organize such things \u2013 sure! We are mainly limited by organizing bandwidth, which ideally the Ring structure will scale. I think deep work does need a change of pace so we can mix technical work with learning how to work with other people.
