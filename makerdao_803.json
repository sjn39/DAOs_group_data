                    "content": "Growth CU will manage two calendars for posting content in the MakerDAO Twitter account, one internal calendar and the other, the DAO calendar, with content from the CUs.  The Internal Calendar In the internal calendar, we\u2019ll be working on a production line of content, from the planning to the final post, derived from the most important updates of MakerDAO, to raise awareness and inform about what we are working on MakerDAO. The tweeting process in the internal calendar comprehends the following steps: Identify the type of information we want to communicate. As for now, we identified three essential types of information to communicate:   Discussions around the future of Maker and Dai: In the forum, there are engaging discussions about the future of Maker and Dai, although for a regular forum user, it\u2019s easy to understand, we want to aim for the inclusion of a broader audience by using Twitter to explain these discussions. We already published a thread explaining one of these discussions extracted from the forum. The next step is to thematize this type of recaps.  The Maker Community Update (Maker UpDaits): A general update about the state of MakerDAO, we will talk about governance, the protocol, and community matters. Initially, the recurrence will be bi-weekly to study its performance, and depending on the results we could modify this event in the calendar. Wait for the first Maker UpDait next Monday!  CU Updates (CU UpDaits): Monthly updates of the milestones achieved by the Core Units through their work within their specific MakerDAO vertical. Hoping to publish the first version in April\u2019s first week, to explain what happened in March.  MakerDAO Announcements: We have the responsibility to update our users with changes occurring in Maker, such as collateral onboardings and offboardings, liquidation updates, and any other change that will have a direct impact in them. Also Partnerships or special initiatives fall into this category.  These types of content are likely to change and evolve due to how our audience reacts to them. Extract specific ideas that will fit these types of content. The next step is identifying ideas, thoughts, updates, events, etc., from all Maker\u2019s sources of info, such as the forum, the governance portal, dashboards, etc. We have a research team inside the Growth CU specialized in extracting this information and digest it so we can have inputs from different sources that will help us to create the right content. Write, create and iterate the content asset. With the idea and the section defined, it\u2019s time to create the content asset. We manage the writing creation process of the content for the tweet. If needed, our content team will ask for complementary assets, such as videos, infographics, images, to external agencies, which will work as the production arm of complex pieces of content. Schedule and publish. When the content asset is ready, we schedule it in the internal calendar and the tweet will be posted automatically.  The DAO calendar The DAO calendar is for CUs to communicate their updates. As we understand every CU will want to use the Maker Twitter account to give visibility to their announcements, we created a framework for Core Units to request communications to be published in there. Process for Tweets requests We created a Notion template to manage each communication request as a small project. This template considers three steps:   Request of communication   Content to be tweeted and date to be published (we will iterate on this until the content fulfills the publication criteria)   The tweet or set of tweets on the MakerDAO twitter    Step by step guide for tweets:    Request a tweet by creating a Notion page into the template.   When a Core Unit is ready to request a communication, a representative designated by this Core Unit must open the Core Unit Tweet Request Notion, hit the arrow button next to the New blue button, and then select \u201cRequest a new tweet by clicking here!\u201d.  1527\u00d7515 74.9 KB  A new request page will be created automatically. After that, there are 3 easy and quick steps you need to do:  Choose an emoji (optional) Write the title of your request. Fill out the two first properties of the page: Core Unit with the Core Unit or Core Units requesting the communication and Estimated Publishing Date with the date they\u2019d like to publish the tweet.   1188\u00d7693 83.4 KB  Go down to the page body and answer the \u201cFor petitioner\u201d questions. These questions will help us understand what we need to know to make the content of the tweet or set of tweets, if the request doesn\u2019t have a tweet already written. In this case, as an example, we will request a new tweet about a recent integration between the Real-World Finance Core Unit and an important institution called Institution.     Writing, iterating, and scheduling.   Cool! From Growth, now it\u2019s our turn to read all the information to put our hands into work.   If the info we received in the previous step is incomplete or we have any questions before writing the content, we\u2019ll ping the requester through comments on the Notion page or through our private Discord channel. Then we\u2019ll change the request status to \u201cRequest for comments\u201d.   Once all the info is complete and we\u2019re ready to start writing the content, we\u2019ll change the request status to \u201cWriting\u201d. Then we\u2019ll write the content of the tweet on the \u201cFor Growth Core Unit\u201d side of the page body (at the bottom).    958\u00d7562 132 KB    Once the first writing proposal is ready, we\u2019ll ping the requester again to review it and receive feedback in a prudent time gap that allows us to make the post on time.   When the tweet is scheduled, we\u2019ll change the Status to \u201cScheduled,\u201d and the property \u201cFinal publishing\u201d will be filled with the final publishing date.   With all this information completed and clear, everyone will see the scheduled tweet at the \u201cPublishing timeline\u201d view. This view will work as a calendar that will organize automatically all scheduled communications from all Core Units.    1553\u00d7658 101 KB   We tweet!   Once the tweet is successfully published, we\u2019ll add the link to the \u201cLink\u201d page property and change the Status to \u201cPublished\u201d.   1482\u00d7550 67 KB   Next steps  Each Core Unit that wants to be included in this framework will designate a representative who will request communications to the Growth Core Unit. We\u2019ll add all these representatives to the Core Unit Tweet Request Notion and a private Discord group. For this to be done, we\u2019ll need the representatives\u2019 emails.  ",
