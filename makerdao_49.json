Today we are pleased to announce the incorporation and launch of Token Flow Insights SA, a company incorporated in Switzerland with the goal of being the leading provider of contextualized analytics for the DeFi ecosystem. You can find more information in our launch blog post here, but the TL;DR for the MakerDAO community is:  Our core team worked together in the Product, Oasis and Data Services teams of the Maker Foundation where we delivered protocol specific datasets and tools such as the MCD Vaults Tracker and MCD Voting Tracker as well as the now open-source Ethereum transaction decoder EthTx; We remain committed members of the MakerDAO community, and in the interim period between leaving the Foundation at the end of May and our launch this month we have continued to provide data and support from our own budget to a number of Core Units and occasionally to community members and delegates on request; As part of this involvement we have sought to open the discussion on the DAO\u2019s data engineering needs with a previous Forum post. We look forward to continuing this conversation with the community and finding a sustainable way to continue to support the various Core Units that we work with as well as the wider community. We plan to post a follow up to this previous thread in the next few days; We warmly invite community feedback and involvement - you can find our Discord, mailing list and other links in our blog post, and we are active on the MakerDAO Forum and also in Rocket Chat as well as a number of the Core Units\u2019 Discord servers.  We look forward to continuing our post-Foundation journey with MakerDAO. The Token Flow Insights team @Arran @tmierzwa @Leonid_Logvinov @piotr.klis @kchojn & Piotr R ",

The short answer is yes, over time. The longer answer is that we\u2019re starting with L1, then capturing and labeling the bridges to L2/scaling solutions, and then as a next step adding L2/scaling solutions directly where possible. We typically prioritize by liquidity flow (as well as technical requirements - the closer to L1 EVM it is, the easier it is to add) so we wouldn\u2019t capture all scaling solutions, but we would endeavour to include the most important from a cross-chain/scaling liquidity perspective  Are you able to track high-frequency trading desk data that moves from TradFi to DeFi?  One of the requests we have seen a lot from alpha and beta testers is whether we can combine CEX and DEX data to give a more holistic picture. The answer to this is similar to L2/Scaling in that we would focus on pure on-chain first, then add entry/exit to CEXs where the addresses can be labelled (not always easy), and then see if that gives enough insight on the overall liquidity flows ",
