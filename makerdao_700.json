                    "content": "Overview It has long been understood that governance participation at MakerDAO is less than ideal. Looking at executive votes, the highest participation executive spells by voter count are far in the Maker protocol\u2019s past.  Table Description automatically generated1364\u00d7760 181 KB  More recent executive votes have consistently seen far lower participation.  Table Description automatically generated1366\u00d7690 186 KB  The situation is similar for polls. The polls that closed the first week of February collected 11-12 voters each. The previous cohort of polls tended to be under 20 voters each. Going back to November and December 2020, it was typical to get between 30 and 45 voters on polls. Part of this drop off in governance participation is widely attributed to sharply rising costs of transactions throughout 2021. Part of the drop off is also likely due to the introduction of vote delegation. While these might be part of the answer, there seems to be more at play, as gas prices per transaction are reported to be highest in May 2021 and delegation went live in early August 2021. The number of calls to the governance contract have declined considerably from September 2021 and have not recovered. In fact, this long-run trend is consistent with economic literature on the private provision of public goods, where participants are less willing to supply public goods at cost to themselves over time.  Chart Description automatically generated1600\u00d7576 219 KB  As of writing, only 42 unique addresses have participated in voting in 2022 according to beta.mcdgov.info. Of those, 20 hold zero MKR, and closer inspection shows that some are only included as active in the headline statistics due to the lifting of MKR from the governance contract. It is also probable that at least some voters are obscuring their stake by utilizing multiple wallets, meaning that there are likely fewer than 22 individual holders that have participated in executive voting in the year 2022. At the time of writing, there are currently 51 addresses with MKR in the governance contract. The top 10 addresses hold 67% of the MKR within that contract, and likely represent only 7 distinct holders. The top 1 address contains 44% of the MKR in the governance contract, making functional governance extremely dependent upon a small number of actors. This Signal There have been several discussions, both formal and informal, around increasing participation of both MKR \u2013 to discourage malicious or nonresponsive governance \u2013 and individuals \u2013 to ensure governance power is not centralized. Unfortunately, how to attract engaged, informed voters is a problem that has largely gone unsolved in most democracies. How to attract and retain new voters who are actively monitoring the protocol and exercise sound, informed judgment is an open question. Efforts to attract a diversity of large holders have also met with mixed results, with only three large holders clearly active in governance. This Signal Request is to initiate a trial of potential payments to individuals participating in the voting process. The initial trial is aimed at polls, which have more straightforward metrics to monitor. The goal is to compare polls treated with potential payments vs polls before and after the treatment, as well as the difference between treated/untreated and governance participation one year earlier. The design will utilize the concept of the dominant assurance contract that was first formally introduced in 1998 by Prof. Alexander Tabarrok. It has, unfortunately, not been tested widely in the real world, perhaps because it requires an entity willing to escrow or believably pledge assurance payments to participants. The only serious documented attempt was by the US Department of Agriculture that successfully used it to increase farmer participation in a program to utilize hay fields for avian conservation. Design An assurance payment of .1 MKR is provided to any address that contributes \u2265 1 MKR in a non-abstain vote on at least one low-turnout poll on any closing date. A low-turnout poll is defined as an ended poll that has <20 addresses that vote an option other than abstain. An address that votes with <1 MKR is not counted for this purpose. This trial will calculate assurance payments on closing dates. A closing date is defined as any Monday or any Thursday after Maker governance approval of this trial that has at least one poll ending. A maximum of .1 MKR may be awarded to any address for any individual closing date of this trial. All MKR rewards will be sourced from the MakerDAO treasury. A budget of 8 MKR will be reserved for this trial. This trial will be in effect until the MKR budget is exhausted or 6 weeks, whichever occurs first. For clarity, only voting on polls with <20 non-abstain addresses (contributing \u2265 1 MKR) will make an address eligible for an assurance payment. Example: Two polls close on a Monday. One poll qualifies as a low-turnout poll, while the other does not. Only those addresses that voted on the low-turnout poll are eligible for .1 MKR. For clarity, no payout is made if a poll has at least 20 addresses that vote with \u2265 1 MKR and vote an option that is not abstain. For clarity, if 20 or more addresses vote on a poll, but fewer than 20 have at least 1 MKR voting weight at poll close, or fewer than 20 have voted an option other than abstain, that poll is considered to be a low-turnout poll. Example: A poll closes with 22 addresses having voted an option other than abstain, but 3 of those addresses carried <1 MKR weight. That poll would be considered a low-turnout poll, making the 19 participating addresses with \u2265 1 MKR eligible for an assurance payment (provided they did not vote abstain). This design was chosen because it:  Offers the potential for payout, without guaranteeing there will be an expense for MakerDAO. Is relatively simple to market/communicate to potential voters who are engaged but not motivated. Offers a meaningful reward to small holders willing to provide a public good at their own private expense. Is straightforward to estimate its effectiveness vs no treatment.  Reporting & Administration To maintain low burden on core units given the simplicity of this trial, GFX Labs will track and publicly update what addresses (if any) are eligible for assurance payments following the close of each trial date. @GFXlabs will provide a written report (via forum post) and oral report (if desired) on a Governance & Risk call after the close of the trial. The report will include the results, as well as recommendations on whether to extend or iterate upon the trial. GFX Labs will manually track which addresses are entitled to assurance payments, submit those addresses GovAlpha for confirmation, and publicly post those addresses to make them aware of their payments, similar to past announcements related to SourceCred distributions. Assurance payments (if any) would need to be included in upcoming executives, similar to distributions made manually to Recognized Delegates. If this trial was made permanent or extended, a technical solution or manual tabulation by GovAlpha would be the most appropriate forms of implementation. GFX Labs is requesting 1000 DAI to cover the cost of allocating personnel for these tasks for the maximum trial duration of 6 weeks. Pros  Potentially increase governance participation, particularly amongst smaller holders Offers payments only when marginal increases in participation are needed Allows experimentation with a novel mechanism without committing to large or ongoing payments Trial will be administered by GFX Labs to avoid adding to governance burden of core units  Cons  Could incur a maximum expense of 8 MKR and 1000 DAI May not generate conclusive results If chosen to be extended or made permanent, this program would likely require an increase in the workload to administer on an ongoing basis Will require some measure of marketing/communication in order to make MKR holders aware of the trial program If the assurance payment amount of .1 MKR is too low to attract voters to polls, then rewards would accrue to those already voting rather than the marginal voter     Implement The Governance Mining Trial Outlined Above?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps This poll will run until 2022-03-02T05:00:00Z. Its outcome will result in an on-chain poll if affirmative. No action will be taken if it is negative. Special thanks to @twblack88 and @ultraschuppi for input when drafting this request. ",

                    "content": "I like anything that tries to break the governance log jam. The hardest part will not be to get button pushers but to actually get intelligent voting (how does one define this btw). Second point.   I wonder why set an arbitrary cutoff on the payments vs low vote participation. In my delegate platform I proposed simply putting down a bounty on poll and executive participation.   Using your above example we could just assign like a 1-2MKR bounty randomly to one or more polls for the week.   People won\u2019t know which poll, they will just know that one of them will get the MKR distributed.    Then run the MKR bounty on alternate weeks to get a clear signal and distribute the 1-2MKR between the qualifying voters for each chosen poll. The whole point here is we want as strong a signal as possible about whether ANY reward for polling would cause people to vote vs. when there is no reward.   Doing this randomly on any single poll may obscure the signal\u2026 How the MKR reward divides between players.  If we do this via wallet vs. something else we can predict what polling is going to look like. 1MKR reward for polling = about .66ETH, .005ETH/poll means we will get just about 100-110 participants.  If this alternates randomly 1/2 the time would drop to 50-55 participants.   But if you have this low vote cutoff on rewards basically can guarantee we probably only get 2x votes each time.  So it might be wise to just pick a poll bounty that is split by voters AFTER the vote based on least number of votes or least MKR voting. Other point I think to be eligible for this trial one might want to have a criterion to have your MKR in governance for some minimum period (like 30 days or something) and to keep it in the governance contract for at least 30 days after the trial ends.    It would be interesting if we also added a reward multiplier on these.   Poll_bounty*poll_wallet_participation_percentage.   Which means what you get in rewards is multiplied by your poll_participation_percentage over the period of interest. This kind of criterion would damp out the signal on non-poll reward weeks but should give a decent signal between rewards on/off. The whole point of doing this as a period trial, with performance and eligibility conditions and a time frame is so the cost to distribute rewards in ETH doesn\u2019t exceed the cost of MKR to send.  i.e. do a one time reward for a longer period of governance activity. I am for doing such a trial btw.   Given I think polling should move to a cheaper chain or even a snapshot I think we really should consider doing this on executives as well. Even though I suggest changes I support the plan as constructed and would be willing to offer 1K DAI personal funds if necessary to grease the wheels on this. Link to my delegate thread where I solicit for comment about a bounty model of rewards for executive and polling participation.     MakerMan delegate platform Delegates       I am putting this into my delegate platform first to solicit for feedback before I even try to poll on this.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about a model for governance compensation that is:   Fair Simple includes compensation for delegates includes a mechanism to encourage delegation of MKR controllable by the DAO has a reasonable cost element rewards directly in proportion to MKR being voted and participation  I believe I have achieved this goal with the following proposal.

I have posted my reservations in the other thread. In a nutshell:   Maker voters are essentially making executive decisions on a monthly or even weekly basis. In the first place we want informed voters who understand the nuances of MakerDAO decisions.   We know it\u2019s practically a full-time job to stay informed about Maker governance and make informed decisions. That\u2019s what our delegates are doing, and they\u2019re being compensated for it.   It makes no sense to try and draw in \u201camateurs\u201d who don\u2019t have enough time to consider their vote properly.   I think we\u2019re confusing Maker voting with democratic voting, which are typically representative democracies. Democratic voting is not the equivalent of voting on a poll in MakerDAO. It is the equivalent of choosing whom to delegate to. Therefore I think that a better way to push for greater decentralization and wider MKR holder participation would be to encourage more MKR holders to delegate their MKR. Run some form of elections where MKR holders are encouraged to pay attention for a moment and delegate their MKR. If we want to play around with incentives, delegating MKR should probably be incentivized more than random voting on polls simply because there aren\u2019t enough voters. To quote my other post:    Improving governance participation rate at MakerDAO   Voter participation is not a goal in itself. In my opinion, the goals are (1) to have good decision making, (2) a resilient governance system that is hard to corrupt, and (3) security against governance attacks.   This experiment, in my opinion, is a good example why the difference matters. Voters == MKR holders delegating MKR holders voting directly on polls will more likely than not be inappropriate micro-management that will make decision making worse. Unless these MKR holders happen to spend an awful lot of time keeping up-to-date with things (like the delegates), or the poll happens to be exceptionally high-level. ",

On top of this, I recommend adding another criterion for eligibility by requiring a comment when voting. Ideally, this would motivate new users to rationalize and state their voting reasons (like our delegates do) to foster higher-quality and well-informed decisions.     wouter:  MKR holders voting directly on polls will more likely than not be inappropriate micro-management that will make decision making worse.

No, I don\u2019t see it as a chicken-and-egg issue. I\u2019m arguing we\u2019re confusing two fundamentally different things: votes by which executive decisions are made in a DAO vs. token holder participation. The one should be done by full-time experts and we should not try to involve uninformed decision makers in the process. The second is put in place to enforce checks and balances (keep delegates in check), and avoid voter apathy and other typical issues. In the future, the difference between the two should only grow. The efforts of GovComms, Strategic Finance, SES, and others, to improve transparency are also needed because otherwise the complexity grows so quickly that even full-time delegates can\u2019t make informed decisions. I don\u2019t believe it will magically turn every token holder into a good decision maker, that\u2019s a different thing. ",

I used to vote semi-regularly when gas was cheap, not because I thought my vote would affect outcomes but because I liked the aesthetic. I do still keep tabs on the governance forums, reading through posts maybe twice a week but never take time to post. As the system has grown in scope and TVL, it is difficult for someone with a financial stake but ultimately casual interest to stay fully informed. I\u2019m not sure trying to entice someone like me or dozens of us to vote meaningful improves the resiliency of governance since the tendency would be to vote with the prevailing consensus. That said there are definitely recognized delegates who have approaches to governance that are much more compatible with how I would do things if I were a decision-maker. I would readily entertain delegating my MKR to one of them if there were a financial incentive. At the moment though, I\u2019m not all that excited to pay gas to take my MKR out of an AMM liquidity pool and put it somewhere that produces less yield, since I don\u2019t think my position will affect any outcomes.

Would it be wise to pay Tesla shareholders more dividends if they give their opinion on how the production line should be run? No, it would simply incentivize the wrong behavior. A DAO is not Tesla. But that doesn\u2019t change the basic fact that good decisions are properly informed decisions. Without extra incentive, it\u2019s still entirely possible for MKR holders of all sizes to participate, even directly. This is radically different from a traditional organization. If you feel particularly strongly about an issue, or if you feel delegates aren\u2019t doing a good job, all information is available and you can cast your vote directly. This is critical and I\u2019m not saying we should change that.

Short-term yield fariming projects from 2020 have simply disappeared completely from the scene, a handful have survived, with an use case. Yield farming only due to yield farming seems there is a lack of sustainable postitive effects. I think that is a natural and right thought process from a delegate to increase the activity for voting regardless of the possible more MKR ending up in the voting power. And creating a dependency on minimum quantities and minimum duration of presence rather increases the chances to participate, on the contrary it should be easier to participate with incentives. In the end, I think there needs to be a long term vision where we need to connect governance and tokenomics, especially with the interplay of L2. The faster we get there, the more such incentives working with governance mining/yield farming in the MKR protocol and we will see more decentralized and sustainable postitive effects result from this. Recently, more and more comments and threads have been piling up regarding this topic of increase governance and tokenomics, including burn. Maybe it just seems that way to me. There is an enormous urgency here that needs to be solved, or rather, concrete approaches need to be taken. Standing here, we want to get there - this is the way/ways! Long term concepts like Multichain Strategy just for governance including tokenomics. ",

Firstly, I\u2019m glad that @PaperImperium made this proposal, and I\u2019m heartened to see the level of discussion here. It\u2019s always been hard to get people to make proposals that could result in concrete actions. As Paper lays out in the trial, the immediate cost to governance is quite low. There is limited downside to running such a trial should it fail. I am however a little concerned that the trial succeeds (or appears to) but that the incentive structure does not work when scaled up. In this case the costs could be much higher over the long term. If this signal does pass, and the trial is successful, I would recommend carefully expanding the scope over time, rather than jumping straight to \u2018production\u2019 values. I\u2019ll also add that I share Wouter (and others) concerns that this incentive structure is targeting the wrong problems. This proposal is designed to increase the number of on-chain voting addresses. There are a couple of points to clarify with this:  Addresses != Individuals / Entities. This the Sybil issue. One entity can control multiple addresses. More voters does not necessarily result in better decision-making.  My main point is that if adopted on a larger scale, this will almost certainly increase the number of participating addresses. However, I think it is likely that those addresses will not result in much more decentralization or better decision-making. Only the appearance of such.  To go back to something I posted in discord. If you\u2019re designing an incentive system in increase participation in governance at Maker. There are a number of points / objectives that you should consider. They are:  Incentives scaling with protocol performance (helps ensure alignment and encourages informed voting.) Rewards that are available for directly-voting MKR are also available to delegated MKR. Delegation reduces the aggregate cost of governance and means that incentive-seekers are not forced to vote directly in an uninformed manner. Ideally you want some structure that encourages long-termism among active governance participants.       williamscofflaw:  Figure you guys might have some interest in hearing my perspective.   It was helpful. Thank you for taking the time.     Puzzler:  It makes me think I paid money for experts to get kingly payments while token owners are told to go away. That is not what you intended I am sure. But it is how it sounds, my friend. Please fix this.   Realistically, it\u2019s a matter of maintaining equal access (any token holder should be able to vote for themselves, and (in my view) receive the same rewards. But there should always be the option for them to delegate their stake and hand-off the decision-making instead of doing it themselves. If you attempt to force people to vote personally in exchange for rewards you end up with either:  Everyone voting without being well-informed of the issue (most likely outcome)  Everyone paying the significant costs required to stay informed about issues of governance (very unlikely, but theoretically possible.)  Delegates currently make this optional, and this should remain the status quo (by offering incentives to voting and delegated MKR equally.)     wouter:  I\u2019m interested in building decentralized organizations that actually work, not something that looks nice on paper but runs itself into the ground.   Somewhat harsher than I would have put it, but essentially this. Incentives are a really good way to end up with unintended consequences, and potentially permanently break things. Trials are fine, but before we scale up any incentive system to \u2018production tier\u2019, we need to have a good understanding of the balance of incentives, the success/failure cases and at least be reasonably confident in its long-term stability.

The Recognized Delegates represent a path to transparency, accountability, more credible decentralization and more effective and efficient decision-making. More MKR delegated from more varied sources reduces the amount of potential leverage any individual MKR Holder has over the delegates, and thereby directly mitigates one of the sources of centralization. The requirements of communication and participation make the system more accessible to the rest of the community and help to avoid the feeling of powerlessness that has resulted from delegation in some other protocols. At this stage, I don\u2019t think the problem is lack of viable options. There are a number of delegates with varied views (though there is always room for improvement here). The most obvious and immediate problem I can see is that the \u2018activation\u2019 cost and ongoing opportunity cost of delegation is too high, given the alternative uses of the MKR token in the current environment (ie borrowing stables and yield farming.)

                    "content": "I am very much in agreement with @LongForWisdom, but with a slightly different take. I don\u2019t think the issue is so much the total amount of MKR delegated (even though it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have this increased as well), but rather the distribution and the number of delegates. We are starting to get into the double digits of recognized delegates, but I still think we would stand to benefit widening this pool, especially with more outsiders joining the ranks. The collective tends to make better decisions than individuals, but only as long as you avoid groupthink, which can more easily happen if backgrounds are too similar (For more in depth reasoning, see this or this study) However, right now the distribution of delegated MKR means that for practical purposes decisions are made by the three delegates with the most MKR delegated to them. Even most delegates are actively involved in discussions surrounding decisions the actual decision is made by a smaller subset. We have a recent example of votes where the recognized delegates were split 7-1 and the decision went according to the minority number of recognized delegates but obviously in the majority of MKR delegated. In another recent poll the recognized delegates were split 8-1 and it barely was decided in favor of the way the majority of the recognized delegates voted. As a result I think the most pressing concern is to gain a better distribution of MKR token holders between recognized delegates to put a greater emphasis on consensus. This means we should focus on initiatives that either incentivizes new MKR holders to delegate or that makes existing MKR holders consider a different distribution of their delegation. An alternative could be to entice MKR holders to vote directly, but I believe that the effort that has to be put in to be an informed voter tend to make delegation a superior option. Going off the feedback provided from @williamscofflaw and analysis given in the larger discussion on governance participation, it seems addressing financial incentives to delegate might be a prudent priority.

Although the proposed trial is well-written, I\u2019m voting a hard NO on this proposal.     wouter:  I\u2019m interested in building decentralized organizations that actually work, not something that looks nice on paper but runs itself into the ground.       LongForWisdom:  If you attempt to force people to vote personally in exchange for rewards you end up with either:  Everyone voting without being well-informed of the issue (most likely outcome)  Everyone paying the significant costs required to stay informed about issues of governance (very unlikely, but theoretically possible.)    I couldn\u2019t agree more with @wouter and @LongForWisdom on this one. I am strongly opposed to implementing governance mining as it incentivises voting as opposed to informed voting. The governance proposals being brought to vote at MakerDAO are of increasingly complex nature and require a lot of context and domain knowledge in order for someone to make an informed vote. Although I agree that the governance participation rate at MakerDAO is evidently low and we should explore ways to improve it, I also believe that the quality of discourse in MakerDAO governance is high and we should never compromise on this. Just as plain liquidity mining schemes tend to attract mercenary liquidity and distort growth metrics, I believe that introducing plain governance mining creates incentives for behaviour that is not necessarily aligned with the long-term well-being of the DAO. It might succeed in attracting more unique voters, but how do we make sure that these newly attracted governance participants are acting in the best interest of the DAO by being informed voters. And what are the consequences of attracting phony voters? I believe the consequences are dire\u2014the outcome of governance proposals directly impact the direction of the project and the actions of the individuals that contribute to it. The DAOs decision-making being distorted by uninformed voters is a direct threat to the long-term success of MakerDAO. I guess it comes down to this question; what are we optimising for? Do we simply want to increase the unique number of voters on the average proposal (a vanity metric imo), or do we want to optimise for a healthy governance ecosystem where the voters are informed about the underlying subject-matter and aware of the consequences of their votes? If the answer is in the latter, then I would state that governance mining is detrimental to this cause. A trial seems like \u201cit can\u2019t hurt to try\u201d, but it\u2019s a dangerous road to go down in my opinion. It\u2019s easy to quantify unique voters (again, a vanity metric) but it\u2019s very hard to quantify the aforementioned unintended consequences (being: impacting the quality of decision-making). ",

To be clear, I 100% agree with you here. I meant to communicate that for me this issue has recently fallen into second place behind the importance of getting more MKR to the delegates. It also seems to be an area in which we\u2019re doing fairly well. The number of delegates is increasing gradually, and some are coming from outside the core community.     JustinCase:  As a result I think the most pressing concern is to gain a better distribution of MKR token holders between recognized delegates to put a greater emphasis on consensus.   This is also important. I\u2019m hopeful that it will come about as a natural consequence of getting more MKR to the delegates. It is a little delicate though. In theory you could offer more incentives for delegation to MKR Holders delegating to delegates with smaller amounts of MKR\u2026 But in practice this skews and undermines the core mechanism of MKR Holders selecting delegates that they believe will effectively represent their views.

KNC has a similar mechanism (rewards voting, not quality decision making or delegating) and what occurred is when gas fees were low, you had people voting randomly or with the consensus opinion.  When gas fees were high and no longer justified the rewards, the voting dried up. I think the delegation system makes the most sense and should be equally rewarded to voting on ones own.  The bigger issue is there is an incentive not to vote (and in fact a disincentive).  If you lock your MKR in the governance or delegate contract, not only is that costly to do (both enter and exit), but you could make much more yield on your MKR by depositing in an AMM or a lending platform. Even just keeping it on an exchange or in a HW wallet makes more sense, since then it is readily and cheaply available to send to a CEX or DEX to trade. To improve governance, I would recommend the following:   Providing a small inflationary staking reward (either in MKR or DAI) for locking MKR in the Delegate or Governance contracts.  I do not think we need to offer higher yields than DeFi and CeFi money markets for MKR aligned holders to delegate or vote. We just need to offer something that will reimburse for gas costs and provide a little yield to narrow the difference versus lending out MKR.   It is essential to lower the cost of voting for individual MKR holders. Perhaps the voting mechanism can be moved to an L2 Roll-up such as Optimism or Arbitrum.  Currently I delegate, but I would probably vote on my own if it only costs a couple dollars instead of $30-$40.   Start using gas-less snapshot voting for Signaling votes.   ",

That said, I agree with @wouter @LongForWisdom and @0xdeniz\u2014it seems to me the problem to solve is to encourage engaged and informed participation in a well-functioning system of governance. I don\u2019t think that incentivizing direct voter participation is the best way to do this, particularly when it opens the door to gaming. Many physical-world democracies actually have quite high levels of participation, and while they are far from perfect, the level of policy expertise in the system is often high\u2014it\u2019s just not concentrated among voters, but rather among the bureaucracy (analogous to the Maker workforce). Democracies (or really, republics) make this work by focusing the voters\u2019 attention not on individual policy decisions, but on electing representatives who (a) develop more policy expertise than voters have, and (b) oversee bureaucrats who are experts on specific issues. So I think it would be really valuable to do some experimentation in this area, but I think it should go in the direction of improving delegation rather than incentivizing voter participation in general. It would be really valuable to trial different ways of incentivizing people to delegate, as well as other ways to change how delegation works. As I\u2019ve argued elsewhere, I think simplifying the delegation problem by creating a defined \u201celection period\u201d when voters are briefly asked to pay attention and decide whom to delegate to would help, and could be one thing worth piloting. Economic incentives to delegate could also be interesting to explore. ",

While I agree on most of the objections that has been brought up, I think there is one wider potential benefit that should be considered. One of Maker\u2019s greatest strengths is its community. Creating community engagement is an important part of that. What is the likely outcome of this initiative. We are likely to see some increased voter participation, probably from smaller MKR holders. As such they are unlikely to make a meaningful change in the outcome of votes. Thus the quality of decisions are likely to remain unchanged. The costs are low, but they might entice people who are currently passive today to become more active participating members of the community. If we are, as some assume, going into more bearish territory we\u2019re likely to lose some members of our community. Having this initiative potentially bringing some more in seems worth the cost to me. If we\u2019re really lucky maybe there is even a future delegate resulting from this very initiative. ",

JustinCase:  The costs are low, but they might entice people who are currently passive today to become more active participating members of the community.   You hit the nail on the head, which is why I also voted yes in the first place. This initiative is a top-funnel growth strategy to get the ball rolling and bring new users into governance. Some people might become dedicated participants or even future delegates as they go down the funnel and Maker rabbit hole. As we measure success, we can evaluate the staying power of governance and optimize processes for new voters from our learnings. I understand the objections and agree that the needed improvements to the delegate process will have a high ROI. I like the idea of incentivized delegation and @Andrew_Hall\u2018s idea of periodical elections to keep delegates accountable and voting fluid. Of course, this would likely need an off-chain component such as Snapshot for accessibility and frequency. Otherwise, let\u2019s focus on getting new users into the funnel. ",

It would be best to avoid stretching teams too thin.   Pardon. These statements seem to argue differently from each other? I agree with the first. But it is a solution to the second nonetheless.
