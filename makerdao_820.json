                    "content": "I propose that the value of Dai be decoupled from the inflation factor that fiat currency has, specifically;  If the Dollar decreases, Dai would remain stable If the Fed succeeds in making the Dollar rise in value (which is difficult to sustain in the long term with the current macroeconomic outlook), Dai would rise along with the Dollar;   if the Dollar then has a mild correction, that correction would only take away part of Dai\u2019s rise if the correction is larger than the rise, the entire rise would be subtracted, and the rest of the fall would not affect its value. This would be achieved by increasing the interest rate charged for issuing Dai enough for the value of Dai to offset the inflation of the Dollar. This may be counterproductive in short to medium term as less Dai will be in circulation due to some vault closures. Still, on the other hand, in the long term, institutions and individuals will borrow Dai and exchange their fiat money or other stablecoin for Dai, as they will be incentivized by the fact that inflation will not affect their capital, although not exactly, as inflation varies by location.  This improvement should increase its adoption. It would be the most exciting stablecoin in the crypto ecosystem and the one that investors who want to take profits from their portfolios in bull markets would opt for the most. Institutions and businesses would adopt it because if they are going to choose to spend or invest capital after half a year or more and want to be absent of most of the possible risks, they will be sure that the value of their equity will be the closest to the previous one than with any other crypto asset. According to my criteria, this idea would fit more with the concept of a stablecoin; the correct term for current stable coins should be parallel coins, as they parallel track their price. Disadvantages and risks:  Mild impermanent loss in Dai pairs with other stable currencies. Will probably slow down the adoption process in the short and medium-term; borrowers will be a bit less motivated to open a vault because of rising interest rates. It would be a bit less attractive for users borrowing Dai to buy and increase their position in different cryptos (the solution to this may be option B below).  If it is not feasible or optimal to make this modification to Dai, then option B could create a new stablecoin with this anti-inflationary feature, a Dai.Ex is an experimental Dai, something similar to how the Polkadot ecosystem does, which has its experimental layer \u201cKusama,\u201d where all the tests are made with real money before putting the original and official project into operation. Dai could become an alternative or secondary haven of value to BTC in the best case.  WhatsApp Image 2022-03-07 at 6.25.11 PM1200\u00d7630 90.4 KB  I add that the forecasts are increasingly negative for the dollar, imagine a Dai in 4 or 5 years with 50% or more annual inflation, is that healthy for Maker?

Suppose electricity gets cheaper and now the investment is only worth 15M GBP (only 19.5M USD). Suppose also that the GBP:USD exchange rate falls to 0.99 (e.g., Soros breaks the bank again ). Now the solar farm is worth sightly less than 15M USD and is subject to liquidation (less than 10M * 150%).

Assuming:  CPI=10%/yr cpiDAI/USD increases by 10%  this means the borrower will pay 10% on top of Stability Fee if and when the borrower needs to buy back cpiDAI. Borrowers would just pick the cheaper vault types, can you help me understand if I am missing something? Thanks  (Edited) Found this from Frax - \u201cThe Frax Price Index Share (FPIS) token is the governance token of the system, which is also entitled to seigniorage from the protocol. Excess yield will be directed from the treasury to FPIS holders, similar to the FXS structure. During times in which the FPI treasury does not create enough yield to maintain the increased backing per FPI due to inflation, new FPIS may be minted and sold to increase the treasury. Since the protocol is launched from within the Frax ecosystem, the FPIS token will also direct a variable part of its revenue to FXS holders.\u201d - Inflation Hedge - Frax Finance \u00a4 ",

Taking the above into consideration, there is no reason to change this in the long run, (most free algorithmic currencies fail or are little used). Perhaps it would be best to diversify into other denominations such as EURDAI or something similar and put together a basket of fiat representations of DAI, that may bring advantages in usability and disadvantages to the protocol.

All this has nothing to do with the concept of a store of value, largely there are more reasons why an asset is a store of value. If we look for more information on the previous point Bitcoin is a store of value, because it has all the main characteristics of a store of value and even has advantages over its traditional rival gold.  These are trust, durability, limited supply, divisible and transferable, uniformity and low storage cost. All these characteristics Bitcoin shares with gold, we can say that if it is a store of value. Now comes the best part the value, the value is something subjective, that is, it is the market that gives this value, the value comes from the people who trust and exchange with this asset, if this asset can be exchange it will have value. There is a lot of misrepresentation, but technically it could be defined that Bitcoin has an \u201cintrinsic value\u201d. Bitcoin is also Money, if we look for all the characteristics that make an asset to be money, we will see that Bitcoin fulfills all of them. In principle the most transcendental that are unit of account, medium of exchange and deposit or store of value. (Here we see that DAI also fulfills what it is to be money). Therefore, inflation is a maladjustment to the economic rules presented by \u201cgovernments or the economy in general\u201d. Inflation does not encourage growth, as does disinflation, which is the process we are in due to the passage of the coronavirus. All these imbalances and adjustments if they are in small portions are beneficial in the long run by balancing the economy, if they go to the extreme as in the case of deflation, they all generate destabilization, job losses, etc. In short, the economy is a cycle, a spiral that does not stop, that needs incentives to grow.

Inflation protection needs to be obtained in a another way, which is arguably best kept outside of Maker\u2019s scope. A couple questions one would have to grapple with:  How do you define inflation? The CPI is one measure, many would contest it. Perhaps you want to maintain your USD buying ability vs real-estate (keep in mind, asset price \u201cinflation\u201d is not what the CPI measures) ? Commodities? Etc\u2026 No \u201ccorrect\u201d answer, but something to decide on.

Commodity futures are one way; making them interact with the crypto universe requires a bunch of work.  And so forth \u2026 much thinking and work here to be done.

The specific issue there is what do we index to? With baskets of currencies the IMF\u2019s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) comes to mind, it is also called paper gold because in a way it was intended to replace gold in transactions (I suppose it is used on certain occasions, maybe today not), it is simply a unit of account made up of several currencies in proportion that banks use as a reserve. Perhaps that model can be transferred in another way to build something crypto? The usability of these currencies if you manage to find their logic will be null, because despite being good references in terms of purchasing power or usability, you said it yourself Bitcoin is not usable in everyday life, we need that indexation to fiat to understand its value. It is good to debate a bit about this, I am very interested in these issues of \u201cstability\u201d and everything that has to do with monetary value. ",

                    "content": "Well, I think what you\u2019re after is a currency that maintains buying power, rather than a denomination that is tied to a specific point-in-time in terms of USD buying power. E.g. you want your 100 Dai today to maintain the buying power of 100 USD as it is today, into the future, in perpetuity. The question is, what mechanisms would support it? Maker today has vaults, every loan is backed by properly collateralized assets which ensure the Dai is properly backed by sufficiently liquid USD-denominated assets. But if you deposit 1 ETH today and get 1500 CPI-Dai out, what mechanisms are there to back its value? What if ETH a year from now is $1500 while the CPI has gone up 10% ? Would the borrower be required to add up collateral to back the eroding buying power? I guess you could do that, but I don\u2019t know how many borrowers would jump on that proposition. Another point -  a point-in-time reference for the USD buying power would have to be chosen. E.g. the CPI-Dai needs to represent the buying power of the USD at a particular moment in time, in order to be consistent. Otherwise if you deposit 1.01 USDC today and 1 Dai out, and I deposit 1.01 USDC 6 months from now and get 1 Dai out, they can\u2019t be the \u201csame\u201d Dai as they have different values. ",

I think the solution is to use RAI, if you want to be purist, in that it is not correlated to fiat. (Technically, we could say that this DAI already exists without correlation to fiat). You could also use RAI to mint DAI, although I don\u2019t know what use cases it would have? In the past it was intended to be used as collateral, but it didn\u2019t come to anything. ",
