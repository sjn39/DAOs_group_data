Now that we have successfully hired a team and are operational, the focus shifts to the formation and execution of the product plan. As a review, the CES mandate reads as follows:  Scale the Dai supply by enabling anyone to onboard collateral in a stable and cost effective manner.  To achieve this mandate, it is imperative we manage collateral as a product and introduce what I refer to as the Collateral Management Lifecycle (CML).  Mandate Overview While there are many dimensions to the CES mandate, the words stable and cost-effective encompass the following attributes and qualities when managing the protocol\u2019s collateral:  Revenue growth Collateral diversification Managing the hard costs Stable Dai growth Sustainability of collateral Technical complexity Reducing risk Security implications Innovation in future collateral types  When we reduce the CML to the basics, there are several distinct Lifecycle Initiatives that reinforce the CES mandate and continuing requirements of the Maker protocol.  Lifecycle Initiatives  Support the ongoing onboarding needs of On Chain (crypto native) collateral. Architect and implement Off Chain (real world assets) collateral solutions to aggressively onboard and scale Dai. Enable a portion of prospective collateral to be onboarded using individuals, partners, and/or intermediaries. Maintain and operationalize all collateral within the Maker protocol. Support the entire collateral lifecycle with Product Management best practices.   Collateral Management Lifecycle1197\u00d7835 118 KB  Based upon the graphic above, the following sections will give a bit more detail on the strategies, goals, and recommendations for the key CML components.  Collateral Management (CM) Types Currently, the Maker protocol is made up of two main types of collateral. Examples include:   On Chain  Crypto/Ethereum native tokens DeFi tokens Stablecoins LP tokens Yield generating tokens (aDai) Future crypto native assets like cross-chain, L2, and NFTs    Off Chain  Real World Assets Future implementation of the Real-World Sandbox  Example: OFH Tokens from Societe Generale-Forge      Based upon the work from the stakeholder alignment meetings, the MakerDAO Initiative Tracker outlines the two initiatives for the Maker protocol collateral and these tracks, CMON and CMOFF will be referenced as such in the CML.   CMON - Collateral Management for OnChain, crypto-native assets  CMOFF - Collateral Management for OffChain, real world assets  It is important to note, while both types of collateral follow the same CML, there are differences in the implementation details. For example, when we look at liquidations for onchain and offchain collaterals, the approaches vary greatly. Onchain liquidations are primarily driven by price data from an Oracle. When a certain price is reached, an auction will happen within a very small amount of time to repay the Dai in the vault. With an offchain liquidation, while there might be a pricing Oracle, it is a very different concept. A liquidation is a significant and infrequent financial event in the real world. A more common scenario is the protocol dealing with a poorly performing asset. In this case, we would initiate a recourse event to custody the asset with a third party then start the price discovery process and assess the next course of action. It might be that the protocol indirectly holds the asset to maturity or engages a market maker to sell the asset. With the above in mind, we are developing the CML to encompass all collateral types while addressing the specific needs of the assets.  Processes, Deliverables, and Operations It is important to point out that each of the key CML components incorporates three key areas of focus.  Processes  Goal: Define and manage processes, roles, and responsibilities   Deliverables  Goal: Identify, develop, and deliver tools and resources   Operations  Goal: Define, track, and communicate results  The CES planning uses these focus areas as a guide to identify and breakdown the work for the Core Unit. Please note, the upfront identification and definition work is considerable due to the constructs of working within a DAO. The GovComms cross Core Unit initiative work is encouraging and addressing many of the CES planning needs relating to information gathering and collaborating across Core Units. Once the Processes have been identified and agreed upon, the Deliverables naturally materialize to support the workflow that has been developed. In many cases, the current workflow is in need of refinements and the transition into a new state requires additional work to support the old and the new until we have the ability to deprecate the old. There is also an Operations focus to ensure we set goals and communicate the results of the work delivered. This is an ongoing effort and the learnings uncovered become inputs into helping us refine the Processes.  Collateral Onboarding Since Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) launched in November 2019, the Maker protocol has been evolving its approach with onboarding collateral. Within the Maker Foundation, it was quite a bit easier to select, prioritize, and implement that collateral types to onboard into the protocol versus the processes we work with today within the DAO. As we are all aware, it is time to iterate and upgrade the collateral onboarding process to scale into the current and future needs of the protocol. Today, the protocol has a legacy of theories, philosophies, and opinions behind the collateral we see in the ecosystem. The protocol had multiple phases of collateral onboarding initiatives starting with ETH and working through ERC-20s, Stablecoins, DeFi/LP/Yield tokens and now, ETH derivatives (stETH, crvstETH, etc.) and using tools like the PSM, D3M, and institutional vaults. And now, the attention is focused on real world assets. The current situation with Maker collateral onboarding is clear:  Processes for collateral onboarding are outdated and not serving us any more e.g., many times, strategic decisions overrule the priorities Bottlenecks often overrule all other priorities \u2013 for example if Oracles is too complex, that vetoes the choice Attempts to onboard collateral that doesn\u2019t add value to the protocol wastes a lot of time Attention needs to be given to the protocol\u2019s \u201cquantity\u201d collateral onboarding phase and expectations reset (Collateral Framework Official) \u2013 many Greenlight statuses with no indication of if or when the collateral will be onboarded Lack of clarity and a single source of information on how to onboard Maker collateral and the expected timeframes   CML Component: Collateral Onboarding The first of the two key CML components is Collateral Onboarding. Enablement is a key part of the strategy and it starts with operationalizing the current collateral approach. As CES continuously learns and optimizes, we teach and enable others to onboard collateral and ensure we do not become a bottleneck. While limitations exist today, like oracle costs, future protocol advancements will enable both dimensions of quality and quantity within collateral types. For the moment, it is in the protocol\u2019s best interest to focus on asset quality to fulfill the CES mandate.   Processes As a reference and starting point, the Collateral Onboarding Process (COB) is a series of DAO and community steps to onboard a single collateral. The Collateral Governance Process lists the timing for onboarding collateral. The Collateral Onboarding Guide contains all of the domain team details for collateral onboarding. The process requires a cross core unit collaboration and worked reasonably well when it was introduced about 18 months ago. Today, it is in need of many updates to support the realities of the Maker protocol and future collateral types. To update the COB process is a significant body of work. As part of the GovComms cross core unit stakeholder alignment meetings, CES has identified this work as a strategic focus. The first three and fifth Lifecycle Initiatives above are covered within this component. Both on chain and off chain collateral types follow the same process although the details within each step of the process may vary.  Deliverables The high-level Deliverable(s) are listed below. This is the initial list and it will change over time to support the needs of the protocol, Dai supply, and DAO.   COD1 - COB Process  Deliver the next major revision for the Collateral Onboarding process to clarify and set the proper expectations for onboarding collateral into the Maker protocol    COD2 - Off Chain Collateral Onboarding  Operationalize and scale the onboarding processes to enable the rapid onboarding of high priority real world assets  Supports our enablement strategy e.g. deliver parallel spellcrafting process, clear documentation, toolkits, technical advisory, and other resources as necessary   Innovate on existing frameworks (e.g. MIP21) to fit the operational and legal requirements of off chain collateral deals    COD3 - On Chain Collateral Onboarding  Onboard the highest priority collaterals to ensure Dai growth with the crypto native collateral types  Supports our enablement strategy e.g. deliver parallel spellcrafting process, clear documentation, toolkits, technical advisory, and other resources as necessary      Each Deliverable above is made up of many smaller deliverables. For example, documentation, toolkits, or the onboarding individual collateral types. These will be identified within the CES stakeholder alignment work, tracked within a project management framework, and reported on a quarterly basis.  Operations Based upon the Deliverables above, the Operations focus provides the ongoing reporting of results. The definition and collaboration work of the Deliverables is in progress and at this point, CES is able to identify several metrics and general time frames to include here. This list will be expanded based upon the results of the stakeholder alignment meetings and work breakdowns.   COD1 - COB Process  Q1/Q2 2022 - First revision of the Collateral Onboarding process including reprioritization of collateral    COD2 - Off Chain Collateral Onboarding  Q1/Q2 2022 - Onboard SocGen and other identified/prioritized partners (the names are intentionally not included)    COD3 - On Chain Collateral Onboarding  Q1/Q2 2022 - Onboard crvstETH-ETH and additional collateral not yet prioritized    This is a point in time look at the current CES work products for this component. Updates will be provided using standard and ongoing communication formats and channels. Some of the CES progress and reporting will be rolled up into cross core unit initiatives and readouts.  Collateral Maintenance To date, a majority of the collateral focus has been onboarding. While it is vital to identify and onboard high-value collateral, ensuring it stays that way is equally important. Collateral Maintenance is the other half of the lifecycle process. Today, it is difficult to identify ongoing, holistic, objective, repeatable processes that continually inspect, assess, and adjust the collateral in the protocol. In most cases, a variety of contributors, Core Units (e.g. Risk), and/or PPG (e.g. MOMC) from the DAO identifies situations where a collateral is not profitable, a parameter needs to be adjusted, or draws attention to a specific issue. It is immensely valuable to have a feedback loop from the community and all indications show it is time to operationalize that knowledge and expertise.  CML Component: Collateral Maintenance The second of the two key CML components is Collateral Maintenance. Management is a key part of the strategy and continuously monitoring, reporting, adjusting, and making choices about Maker collateral is the goal. This is a cross core unit initiative and CES plays a key role in the coordination and execution of plans that keep the protocol healthy.   Processes In traditional finance, there are entire divisions within companies where the main goal is the continuous evaluation of collateral under management. On a smaller scale, the Maker protocol has the same need and the CML component Collateral Maintenance focuses on collateral management specifically. This is another Lifecycle Component requiring substantial cross core unit participation and data inputs from a variety of sources. Hopefully it is clear that communication and collaboration is the cornerstone of most high-level initiatives within MakerDAO. As far as existing processes or sources of data, there are a few today:   MakerDAO OMC - Publishes a proposal of collateral parameter changes to be considered by the community.  Risk Core Unit - Provides a critical source of information with their growth and risk metrics and monthly reviews.  Data Insights Core Unit - Provides deeper insights into the Maker protocol using tools such as the MCD Vault Tracker and providing datasets and resources to a variety of MakerDAO groups.  Real World Finance Core Unit - Publishes financial insights and data into the health of the Maker protocol.  Based upon the data and insights above and others yet to be developed, the Maker collateral will be managed holistically and proactively ensuring the appropriate decisions are made when collateral exceeds the expectations or doesn\u2019t perform as expected. This introduces the concept of Collateral Operations and a focus for the CES Core Unit. It is a proactive activity that monitors the health of the Maker collateral to assist all of us in knowing when to take action on a specific collateral type or an entire category. In the past, this has been a bit bumpy especially in the cases of collateral offboarding or working with under performing collateral. For real world assets, there is a requirement for ongoing collateral analysis and review since the concept of a liquidation is very different from the Maker protocol\u2019s on chain process. The fourth and fifth Lifecycle Initiatives above are covered within this component. Both on chain and off chain collateral types are considered in this initiative although the details within the steps of the defined processes will vary.  Deliverables The high-level Deliverable(s)s are listed below. This is the initial list and it will change over time to support the needs of the protocol, Dai supply, and DAO.   CMD1 - Collateral Operations  Deliver and implement the first iteration of the Collateral Operations process to ensure the proactive management of Maker collateral  An important use case is the management of collateral onboarded and iterating on MIP62       CES is in the initial phase of starting this work and Collateral Operations is made up of many smaller deliverables. These will be identified within the CES stakeholder alignment work, tracked within a project management framework, and reported on a quarterly basis.  Operations Based upon the Deliverables above, the Operations focus provides the ongoing reporting of results. The definition and collaboration work of the Deliverables is in progress and at this point, CES is able to identify a general metric and time frame to include here. This list will be expanded based upon the results of the stakeholder alignment meetings and work breakdowns.   CMD1 - Collateral Operations  Q1/Q2 2022 - First iteration of the Collateral Operations process implementation    This is a point in time look at the current CES work products for this component. Updates will be provided using standard and ongoing communication formats and channels. Some of the CES progress and reporting will be rolled up into cross core unit initiatives and readouts.  Summary While there is a lot of information in this document, the goal was to give the community an idea of the CES plan and process we are following to fulfill the mandate and deliver value to the protocol. Yes, this will change as soon as this document is published and the reporting and feedback mechanisms will be designed to provide meaningful updates on an ongoing basis. Very quickly, the deliverables and metrics will get much more specific once there is better definition of the dependencies/requirements from key stakeholders and Core Units. This is already underway with the stakeholder alignment meetings through the ongoing GovComm work as well as the continued onboarding of the CES team. Thanks for reading! ",

The work we\u2019ve been doing so far has mostly been focused on ensuring that the operational and legal requirements of the RWA deals are supported by the technical implementation onchain. MIP21 is a great baseline to build off of, but we\u2019ve already seen the need to make minor modifications in the implementation for RWA in the pipeline to meet operational and legal requirements. A lot of our work will thus be to analyze what changes are needed for a each deal and implementing them. Over time we expect to have a small library containing variations of contracts within the MIP21 framework as building blocks, similar to how we have many different GemJoin adapters, that we can pick and choose from when onboarding RWA depending on the specific needs. In terms of your bullets 1 and 2 I would say these are definitely within our scope.   Personally I\u2019ve worked on numerous integrations with custodial service providers in the past, and it is a component of the deals we\u2019re are already working on. So if the need is there, CES can and will definitely provide integration support.   For one of the deals we are currently working on, we are building a simple UI to allow a non crypto native stakeholder to easily carry out tasks in the operational flow of managing the RWA vault. Here we identified the need to teach this stakeholder about best practices regarding private key management, and how to sign/execute Ethereum transactions in the dapp using a hardware wallet. I would say this \u201ctechnical\u201d onboarding/support is definitely part of our scope.   For 3 and 4 I\u2019m not as certain about our role yet, but here are my initial thoughts:   From a high level point of view we\u2019ve identified the need for better reporting and monitoring of RWA collateral types, but we still need to understand these needs in more concrete detail, and how this fits in with the operational flow of RWA vaults. I\u2019ll let @monkey.irish chime in on this one in terms of CES\u2019 role in achieving this.   I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll be the direct service provider here - I\u2019ll let @monkey.irish add more color here as well. I believe we can as a minimum act as a facilitator of ensuring that a third party can provide operational security audits and best practices similar to the Immunefi Security Core Unit offering within MakerDAO.

A liquidation is a significant and infrequent financial event in the real world. A more common scenario is the protocol dealing with a poorly performing asset.

It might be that the protocol indirectly holds the asset to maturity or engages a market maker to sell the asset.   As @monkey.irish observes, this is an important distinction between exclusively on-chain assets and off-chain assets. @Real-World-Finance are collaborating with the Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit and the Sustainable Ecosystem System Core Unit to develop a proposal on how best for Maker to address a poorly performing asset. For certain, up-front due diligence and developed legal structures will support Maker in this process.     monkey.irish:  In traditional finance, there are entire divisions within companies where the main goal is the continuous evaluation of collateral under management. On a smaller scale, the Maker protocol has the same need and the CML component Collateral Maintenance focuses on collateral management specifically.   This \u201ccontinual evaluation\u201d is a critical part of the CML. And again, exclusively off-chain assets will be very different in terms of requirements compared to on-chain assets. Fortunately, traditional finance provides guidance in this regard. From a contract perspective, we will continually seek avenues (subject to  confidentiality concerns) to leverage the transparency ethos of the Maker community to ensure higher visibility in collateral management.     monkey.irish:  Very quickly, the deliverables and metrics will get much more specific once there is better definition of the dependencies/requirements from key stakeholders and Core Units. This is already underway   I confirm that the Core Units are already making measurable progress in substantive areas of CML and I look forward to the continued learning and collaboration. ",

I\u2019ll let @monkey.irish chime in on this one in terms of CES\u2019 role in achieving this.   Hey @flipflopflapdelegate! I was out on vacation and back today. There is a lot of definition needed for Collateral Operations. I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll work with the key stakeholders and come up with the necessary processes and techniques to ensure the assets locked as collateral are healthy. We\u2019ll need to figure out where we or others can provide financial and technical assistance. My goal is, when we identify infrastructure outside of our domain knowledge, those would be opportunities to partner with external firms. Today, we could leverage many well known traditional finance players to evaluate assets for us thereby augmenting our risk teams. Looking for ways to automate the integration of data is also a key objective. ",

I believe we can as a minimum act as a facilitator of ensuring that a third party can provide operational security audits and best practices similar to the Immunefi Security Core Unit offering within MakerDAO.   I definitely want to leverage resources with specific domain knowledge here. Again, identifying then filling the gaps is important to us. @flipflopflapdelegate ",
