This means the reputation tied to your soul(s) is important if you want to become a trusted source in the long run. But how should that work?  Questions and topics for discussion  How is citizenship granted? Airdrops are not a good option, do we grant it to individuals in this forum? Are \u201csouls\u201d public keys/addresses or are they non-transferable tokens as well? (Which brings up the interesting topic of social recovery) Should we be able to revoke citizenship? I think it would be important to figure out a way to remove bad actors, but doing it in a way that is censorship resistant is non-trivial.

In terms of granting citizenship I actually can\u2019t think of a Sybil resistant process that would work outside of either meeting in person or in significant numbers of online meetings. I\u2019ve recently completed the BrightID verification process, where you attend a short video chat and prove that you are a real human, but having done so it\u2019s clear that you could attend multiple meetings and the hosts would have no way to know you aren\u2019t new, but are just authenticating multiple accounts. I haven\u2019t tried Proof of Humanity yet but I suspect it has similar limitations. Accounts with a long history of POAPs could potentially be used, it would be pretty difficult (or at least time consuming) to attend loads of events and DAO meetings etc under multiple accounts, but it would also be exclusionary as not everyone who we might want to include as a citizen will have a long enough history. It\u2019s a really tough question, and solving it is probably going to be one of the most important next goals for the Optimism Collective. Regarding souls, yes I absolutely think they should be linked only to social recovery wallets, it would be heartbreaking to read stories every week from contributors who have lost access to their wallet and therefore lost their soul! The only real mass-adoption ready social recovery wallet I know is Argent, which doesn\u2019t support L2s other than zkSync, so maybe we need to allocate some funds to get an OP native one built. As for revoking citizenship. Tough one to be honest, but I don\u2019t think so. If we have strong enough Sybil resistance that users really do only have one citizenship account then this will end up as the basis of a lot of reputation. If someone is found to have been doing something bad enough that you would consider revoking citizenship if it were possible then presumably they would have a severely tarnished reputation. Unlike the Token House where a bad actor could theoretically buy they way to more power, I envision the Citizen House as a governance structure where everyone has an equal vote, therefore the consequences of someone making intentionally negative decisions would likely be minimal. I guess that does depend a lot on how the structure of that model works. ",

It\u2019s hard to know to be honest, because we don\u2019t see a lot of submissions trying to do that - because most people don\u2019t want to risk a deposit over another identity. Having your profile removed also removes the person that \u201cvouched\u201d for you, so that\u2019s another layer of security/associated cost. The community has tools to find duplicates, like faces.humanity.tools, and if you challenge a registration successfully you should get around 0.1 eth (minus fees).

I think it would be important to figure out a way to remove bad actors, but doing it in a way that is censorship resistant is non-trivial.  Yes, I agree, there should be an option to remove the citizenship. But important is to agree on definition of bad actor, what makes a citizen a bad actor? are there any set of rules, best practices, I think this is second important question. One approach would be, gov model, if someone found and proven bad actor from the gov voting his/her citizenship would be revoked. ",

That not enough, may be join meetings, go and attend local Op ecosystem seminar/hackathon. Make is point base, once you have a sufficient number of point, you get the citizenship.   I agree with this, as far as possible Optimism and its community should be able to establish their own mechanism or depend minimally on other ID systems (as an extra it may be). Precisely I think that the delegates already relatively identified as unique identities, we can take a role as initiators, curators, but the mechanism to avoid malicious behavior should be well thought out.

While you can argue either side of the coin on that one, I think somehow connecting citizenship to voting is an interesting concept. Obviously people are busy and can\u2019t always vote on every proposal, but it could be a time based thing, like voting once a year minimum etc. The other part of that would be that voters need to pass a test (similar to the airdrop test) for the vote in order to ensure they understand what they are voting for. To incentivise engagement there could be financial rewards as well, that function kind of like how people get paid for doing surveys. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lot, but enough to imply that engagement is rewarded. ",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an easy way to do this at the moment, but I could imagine it wouldn\u2019t be super difficult to set up a mechanism to do this, or am I missing something? Perhaps being a citizen, rather than a one-time / short-term thing that\u2019s awarded with a single token, it\u2019s also weighted depending on participation? So e.g. someone who is very active for two months has a right to be involved in decisions at the end of that period, but if they were then to stop participating for a year, they have less of a say in what happens then?

This part is interesting! This will boost real participation and involvement in the proposals. But, at the same time, we are not fully dedicated to one thing, we are humans and A LOT of things happen in our lives. We have to be careful in the way we communicate this, if this becomes a standard of the Citizen House. The point is how do you measure participation?
