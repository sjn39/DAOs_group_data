Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: Sushi\u2019s ethos has always been about multichain expansion. We\u2019ve ran various liquidity mining programs on Polygon, Fantom, Moonriver, Arbitrum etc. We\u2019ve helped kick start liquidity in various ecosystems and plan to continue to do so. Recent deployments in 2022:  Metis Launch Kava Launch Boba Launch Optimism Launch Arbitrum Nova  Competitors, peers, or similar projects:  Uniswap TraderJoe Spookyswap  Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes, Sushi has always been open sourced. Optimism native?: Multichain Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: Sushi got deployed on Optimism in May 2022. Check out the announcement here. Project Description, Optimism Alignment & Ecosystem Value Proposition: Sushiswap is currently one of the leading decentralized exchanges which was launched in August 2020. The protocol adopts an AMM model and has facilitated over $225.05B worth of trades since its inception. Sushi products deployed on Optimism (Over the past 3 months):  Trident  SushiXSwap Coming soon: Limit orders, Kashi, MISO & Permissionless Onsen Farms, Trident Stable Swap Pools  The team at Sushi plans to use this grant to help increase the liquidity of the Optimism ecosystem. How will the OP tokens be distributed? All of the OP tokens granted to Sushi will be distributed to liquidity providers who help bootstrap the initial Optimism liquidity for Trident with cross-chain swaps via SushiXSwap being the focus. SushiXSwap is a unified, multichain UI for swapping tokens across any of the major chains.The team solves the liquidity crunch by plugging into our own Sushi liquidity pools which are currently deployed on over 18 different chains. Being able to use this liquidity guarantees our users to always receive the best price for any pair across all the chains. SushiXSwap can be currently used here. With cross-chain swaps in mind for the rewards, we\u2019re proposing to incentive these 3 pairs to start:  OP-ETH 1% (500 $OP per day for 180 days) ETH-USDC 0.05% (1500 $OP per day for 180 days) ETH-USDT 0.05% (800 $OP per day for 180 days)  OP rewards will be used to bootstrap the 1% fee tier for OP-ETH, and 0.05% USDT/USDC - ETH pairs. Each of the pairs will be constant product pools (50-50), and will have TWAP oracles enabled. With the OP rewards we will be targeting around 10% APR on $10m in TVL for ETH-USDC, $5m for ETH-USDT, and $3m for OP-ETH. With liquid ETH-USDC & ETH-USDT pools an easy gateway will open up to allow users on other chains to easily swap tokens from the source chain to Optimism tokens. Main benefit being the ability to top up gas on Optimism wallets via swaps on any source chain Sushi is deployed on. For example w/ fee tiers and stargate\u2019s 0.06% bridge fee, users will be able to swap from MATIC on Polygon to ETH on Optimism with a 0.16% fee. Also with a 1% fee tier on the OP-WETH pair it will ensure that swaps from any chains on Sushi will be routed through the Optimism OP-WETH pair with all of the fees staying within the OP ecosystem. How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Sushi has plans to co-incentivize the liquidity pools as well. With targeted 10% APRs on the pairs, we believe this provides enough rewards to bootstrap the main pairs enough to get things kick started for cross-chain swaps and help increase the activity & usage on Optimism. We\u2019ll also be looking to bootstrap other pairs with SUSHI as they work their way into the onsen program. With increased liquidity on OP, it\u2019ll also open the opportunity for native projects to have a place for their token to become liquid for cross-chain swaps as well. Added benefits in the form of BentoBox\u2019s strategies will also deploy idle capital (OP, WETH, USDC, USDT) within the Optimism ecosystem, and thus will help aid in increasing usage and liquidity across OP. Sushi has previously run similar dual rewards for LPs on Polygon, Gnosis, MoonRiver, Fantom, etc. Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? The plan is to kickstart cross-chain activity with bootstrapped OP rewards for 180 days, and SUSHI rewards continuing after the OP rewards end (potentially also recycled Sushi from fees w/ implementation of Meji proposal). Expectations are that volume will reach levels that it continues to be profitable w/o rewards, and liquidity will be sticky enough for long-term usage of the cross-chain swap functionality. Additionally, Sushi has plans to deploy each of our other products on Optimism and with bootstrapped liquidity it will be a good kickstart for activity from day one with the additional products like Miso, Kashi, Furo and Limit Orders. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The rewards will be distributed over a 180 days period. Has your project previously received an OP token grant? If yes, what\u2019s the status of these tokens? Sushi has not received any grants from OP. This is the first proposal submitted. How much will your project match in co-incentives? Initially Sushi will be able to reward similar rates as we do on other chains, with 100-300 SUSHI per day being the initial targets for each pair plus expansion into rewarding other pairs as they pop up or work into the onsen program.  300 Sushi per day for ETH-USDC 250 Sushi per day for ETH-USDT 150 Sushi per day for OP-ETH  The above are rates similar to what we incentivize on Arbitrum (700 sushi per day in total).

One of the main reasons why we haven\u2019t deployed rewards yet on OP too is because we were planning on spinning out our new permissionless Staking Contract here to start. Also actually am curious though what everyone thinks in regards to the amount of rewards we are asking, initially we wanna keep it low to just get a good start going here but we also wanna keep it low so we can do other cool things with OP grants n stuff down the road especially if/when Meji comes through and opens up an easier and streamlined way for funding grants / further development. Totally agreed on Meji as well, a lot of us are really excited with the proposal / work already being done for it as well. Which is why I do think it\u2019s important to get a kick start going on OP for 180 days, and then when Meji kicks in the fly wheel will already be in place to really get it spinning here. ",

                    "content": "Thanks a lot @jackanorak @Jiro Has covered it very well. I would just like to add few more details to it. To, start with we have already deployed several of our products on Optimism - Trident, SushiXSwap, BentoBox and Furo. These all our new products powering the best of Sushi, just for OPtimism. Sushi is very focused in the Multichain vision. We believe that the future will be multichain first. We are taking careful steps in that direction. The first multichain expansion was with the SushiXSwap, which gave users the capability to do cross chain swaps. Our next step in this expansion is Sushi 2.0 UI. Which is a UI that is built to rule them\u2019all and blur the lines between different chains for the user. Users will be able to see all the opportunity at Sushi across all the chains in a single page, providing superior UX than any other dapp in the ecosystem currently. This would allow better visibility for Optimism as users don\u2019t have to change chains to see the opportunity. The UI would also allow users to LP directly into these opportunities via SushiXSwap. So, now users see all the opportunities in a single page, and no matter which chain they have funds in, they can easily LP into OPtimism in just a single transaction. We will be also deploying Bentobox Strategies that will provide better capital efficiency for sushi users on Trident & Furo. These strategies will be deployed to dapps on OPtimism, hence contributing to the larger ecosystem. We are also launching a new Pool Type on Trident really soon, which will allow users to trade the correlated assets better, it inherits all the benefits of the bentobox as well. As @Jiro has already mentioned, our Permission-less Staking will also be released on OPtimism, providing incentive for multiple projects inside OPtimism ecosystem. With all the benefits we provide to the OP ecosystem and it\u2019s users, it will help us build the strong foundation and provide users to move from various chains to OP  The main component for this would be our Trident and SushiXSwap, coupled with the new UI, users can see the opportunity at OPtimism and can easily traverse into it. So, the above grant helps us to build strong foundation on OPtimism and paving the way for future products to easily extract the benefits and give it back to the OP users and the ecosystem. On the Meji Proposal, like every tokenomics update, we would be looking at all the aspect and how it impacts the Sushi Ecosystem, as unlike other protocols, Sushi has been working towards a DeFi Powerhouse and soon a NFT Powerhouse too  We would be looking at various data points and try to improve the model from that gathering, but as @Jiro outlined, it will make our process only smoother.

Below is a short summary of the concerns and what we\u2019ll be doing to address them. 1. Extend Rewards Distribution Cycle: Previously, we were planning to finish distributing the $OP incentives over a 6 month period. However after some feedback, we decided it would be best to extend it to a 1 year distribution period so liquidity providers will be incentivized to keep their liquidity on OP. Sushi will be matching and co-incentivizing the pools as well. 2. Be clear about the matched incentives: Initially we gave an estimate of around 100-300 Sushi rewards per day for each of the pools. We are now clearly defining the reward numbers for each pool.  300 Sushi per day for ETH-USDC 250 Sushi per day for ETH-USDT 150 Sushi per day for OP-ETH Do note that we plan to expand and incentive more pairs going forward. The pairs listed above are what we are proposing as an initial kickoff.  ",

                    "content": "hi @Trudahamzik, thank you for your well written proposal and your adjustment to the feedback by community members and delegates. I personally value Sushi for its solid products and its ability to ship across multiple areas across swaps, cross-chain, lending, NFTs, and streams. I recognize that my feedback might come in a bit late, given that you have started gathering feedback since mid-august. I hope you wouldn\u2019t be frustrated with the long process and it would be a fruitful experience for you, Sushi, and Optimism. Given your diverse product ranges, I will further take @jackanorak comment for Sushi products and  encourage you to split the incentives not only towards the three pools, but also towards others. Sushi contributors mentioned correlated assets pools, permission-less staking and others. I might not be fully updated to what Sushi has been cooking, so please update me where I am at fault:   Kashi Markets: Kashi Markets isn\u2019t on Optimism yet. Is there a possibility deploying a few selected isolated pools on Kashi Markets to Optimism, and add incentives to them.   Limit Orders: Limit orders aren\u2019t yet available on Optimism. Is there a space to incentive using them?   Shoyu 2.0: Your future open marketplace for NFTs. Is there a place for an initial optimism launch, instead of mainnet?   Furo Stream: This is a great product that is well underused. Is there ways to push for a wider adoption for DAOs on Optimism?   Interested to hear other community members and delegates feedback on this well. Sushi is a fully loaded Swiss Army knife that is yet to unleash its potential on Optimism. IMHO, your proposal would be much stronger if you manage to cooperate with the different teams in Sushi to collectively increase usage for Sushi on Optimism. Lastly, a logistic question to clarify the splitting of the proposal: are you including both Part 1 and Part 2 in cycle 7 for a voting round? My understanding is that Part 2 proposal would come in 6 months after Part 1 for review, given how the incentives have worked. ",

Here are some answers to your questions:   Yes, we do plan to launch additional pools and split the incentives among them as well. As our main focus is currently SushiXSwap, we decided to start off with the 3 most popular pools (OP/ETH, ETH/USDC, ETH/USDT) to draw initial liquidity over to OP. We do have plans to offer incentivized WBTC, Sushi & Synth pools as more liquidity flows into OP. We also didn\u2019t want to go crazy right off the bat with the incentives but gradually ramp them up over time instead.   Kashi Markets & Limit Orders will be launched on OP for sure. We\u2019re currently in the midst of integrating them with our new Sushi 2.0 UI. This might take a while, but we\u2019re hoping to get them up and running asap.   The team from Shoyu plans to launch only on mainnet for now. But yes, there will be a place for an Optimism launch in the future.   Thank you for highlighting Furo, we do have big plans for it. Furo currently has a TVL of almost 100M. We\u2019re planning to use \u201cSushi Academy\u201d, an education hub that features content on all things Sushi to educate users on our products and push for wider adoption. We also want to get our new head chef to actively engage with other native OP protocols and ensure they know that Sushi has a streaming/vesting product that can be implemented with their existing DAO tooling system e.g Making appearances on OP radio or various AMAs held by the OP team.   Part 2 of the proposal should only be reviewed in April 2023. I will not include it in cycle 7 for a voting round.   Feel free to DM me if more clarifications are needed. ",

Trudahamzik:  Las expectativas son que el volumen alcanzar\u00e1 niveles en los que seguir\u00e1 siendo rentable sin recompensas, y la liquidez ser\u00e1 lo suficientemente r\u00edgida para el uso a largo plazo de la funcionalidad de intercambio entre cadenas.

As of now SushiXSwap is integrated only with Stargate. We are currently in discussions with various bridges to get them integrated as well.   To elaborate more on the statement, Sushi\u2019s long term plan is to help increase liquidity and trading volume on OP up to a sustainable level where neither extra $SUSHI nor $OP rewards are needed to incentive liquidity providers to remain on OP. e.g. Earning the swap fees alone will be enough to keep liquidity providers for various popular pool pairings happy   You can find a chart below which shows the Swap, LP, Lending & Borrowing activity on Sushi Polygon. Unfortunately I could only retrieve data from October 2021, but we started our dual reward incentive programme in May 2021 hence the uptick in activity. Fast forward to a year later (in a bear market), you can see that the current on-chain activity still sits in a healthy 5K - 20K range.    Swaps, LP events on Sushi Polygon866\u00d7741 114 KB  ",

Por ejemplo, ganar solo las tarifas de intercambio ser\u00e1 suficiente para mantener contentos a los proveedores de liquidez para varios emparejamientos de grupos populares.
