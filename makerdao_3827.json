People have articulated better than me on this forum and on Twitter, but a potential (and highly speculative) scenario is:  we take a hit on USDC (we might even have to mint MKR to pay bad debt and dilute its value) the whole world realizes that decentralized, permissionless, and censorship resistance matters more than they thought someone looking for stablecoins that follow those criteria picks up the phone and ask you why you like DAI you tell them \u201cbecause it\u2019s decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant\u201d you drop the mic  ",
