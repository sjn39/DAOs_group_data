Generally, those participating in the core devs group are able to come to a decision based on discussions among well-informed and trusted peers. There are not many barriers to joining these discussions, but there is a meritocracy informally maintained in the discussions themselves. In order to achieve the highest possible quality of governance decisions, each participant must be able to follow the logic of a particular discussion and relate it to the greater context of the Ethereum protocol and ecosystem. Participants judge the specific points that are made and determine their weight or bearing on the general direction of the discussion; first by knowing who made the point, and then by interpreting the content of the point. This point-by-point judgement requires a lot of experience with each other, and with the technical material at hand. From that process, the group is able to come to a decision on a protocol change, by rough consensus, without even voting. ",

                    "content": "I don\u2019t think this is a very hypothetical scenario.  There are two main players when it comes to governance - the decision makers (core devs / client creators) and the enforcers (miners). It\u2019s been observed time and time again that the majority of enforcers are either apathetic to governance changes, or purposefully side with core dev decisions.  I personally believe it\u2019s apathy, but until we have signals for yes/no/abstain AND \u201cno vote\u201d, it\u2019s hard to support that argument.  For those who are not apathetic, there is a strong financial incentive to follow core dev decisions due to a number of reasons. So, if we assume the enforcers are always going to side with the decision makers, then there is really only a single governance entity (although it itself is not a single body).  Still, this entity is comprised of a narrow slice of users/developers that do not really reflect the demographic using Ethereum. This group of core devs / client creators inhrently have a meritocracy though, like @jpitts is saying.  They don\u2019t need even an informal system to determine who is consistently presenting logical discussions and valuable research.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that people like Vitalik rank quite high on this totem pole, while an anonymous redditor probably ranks fairly low (regardless of arguments being presented).   This is the \u201crough consensus\u201d that was not accidental, but planned from the start. To an outsider though, it certainly looks and behaves like a benevolent oligarchy. ",
