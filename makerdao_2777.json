Despite several years of daily use of ERC20 tokens, I unfortunately managed to make a mistake and send  some ERC20 tokens  to the DAI contract instead on another wallet. Here is the DAI contract address : 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F Could you please tell me if there is a way to get those ERC20 tokens back? Maybe using the read & write features of Etherscan? I am very sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate any help. Best, ",

My impression was that:   the Dai sent to the contract was (effectively) burnt. we could check in the blockchain if Dai was actually sent to the contract (and the originating wallet).  So I don\u2019t think that minted Dai would count as \u201cunbacked\u201d.  You are right that you would probably need to create a function that mints Dai manually, so it probably would weaken the security of the system.     ",

However, in principle, MakerDAO could recognise that loss and mint new DAI to cover your (and other people) loss. At the moment, however, this policy has never been executed, nor properly designed. What can you do: You should do one (or better, all) of the following:  Join MakerDAO\u2019s discord channel and ask for help to learn how to make a Signal Request.   Study, in this forum\u2019s history, how Signal Requests are made. Perhaps somebody can even link you to a template. Start a discussion and Signal Request, to implement the feature to refund people who lost money sending DAI to the DAI address.  It\u2019s a bit of work. Sure. But maybe 50k DAI is a sufficiently good motivation/compensation for you to do it. And it will also be useful to others. Good luck! Edit: additional problem. It seems like you used coinbase (link to transaction). So, if implemented, the DAI will be sent back to that address (i.e., Coinbase) and you\u2019ll need to contact them to see if they would then send the DAIs to you. ",
