                    "content": "Hi Everyone, As most of you know, we had an informal poll to have a cool off period before we decided what to do with the 84k MKR received from the Foundation. While months have not passed, I think enough time has gone by that we can make certain decisions about these funds. I would personally like to propose that we send these funds to the burner. Pros  Removes the cognitive overhead of deciding what to do with these funds. Trying to find a \u201cpurpose\u201d for these funds will ultimately lead to potential wasteful spending. Potential positive PR implications  Cons  Potential legal ramifications with regards to securities law when minting future MKR to replace burned ones Could be used in the future for fundraising or any unforseen capital costs. Counter-argument is minting would achieve the same goal (loop back to possible legal ramifications)  Should we burn the 84,000 MKR sent to us from the Foundation?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Next Steps Polling will end on 2021-06-10T16:00:00Z. If \u201cYes\u201d wins with a majority, I will create an on-chain poll for MKR holders to vote on the following Monday. If \u201cYes\u201d then passes the on-chain poll, an executive in the future will be created that includes a spell that will burn this MKR. As always, I look forward to hearing your feedback and discussion. ",

I suppose by burning them, we reduce the likelihood/temptation of having them find their way into the market, diluting the price. I\u2019m not sure how it looks though to burn a little under 10% of our supply. We\u2019d basically just chop our market cap by that much. Is that bad? Good?  ",

Instead of burning, a better symbolic act would be set aside a portion or the whole set to reward supporters and bootstrappers of the Sai & Dai Credit System with MKR.  The same way Uniswap airdropped their UNI token to LP\u2019s and users, it would be great to widen the circle of MKR governance community and a show of goodwill to anyone who has interacted with/created a vault, OasisDEX, voted, or any other Maker property, because without these users the system wouldn\u2019t have been possible.  Since the MKR token preceded even Sai, it was impossible to reward these early participants with MKR (such as through yield farming schemes which exist today\u2013which I\u2019m not recommending btw).  I think it could potentially be a big event in DeFi. ",

Regarding the cognitive overhead, I think it\u2019s one of those \u201cgood-to-have\u201d problems so that doesn\u2019t worry me too much - I am confident our governance is able to handle such issues. My recommendation is that we keep it as an emergency reserve or strategic reserve fund. We only do something with it when the protocol has an issue that is beyond the scope of the surplus buffer. That kind of satisfies this requirement to a large extent     Aaron_Bartsch:  We should act like they don\u2019t exist.   As for this point     Aaron_Bartsch:  Counter-argument is minting would achieve the same goal (loop back to possible legal ramifications)   You\u2019re right that it\u2019s the same thing but the optics of burning now and minting later vs the optics of \u201cusing our insurance fund\u201d to cover protocol losses are quite different.

Burning seems a somewhat shortsighted attempt to pump the MKR price that really isn\u2019t necessary. We already have a very solid reputation when it comes to low token supply, and trying to make a big PR stunt about a manual burn event could very easily attract regulators\u2019 attention. It\u2019s one thing to have it as a protocol mechanic (with already a very high burn ratio!), it\u2019s another to explicitly decide to burn for PR effects. Minting then creates again legal risk, and breaks the rule that MKR is only minted to save the protocol from insolvency. The latter could be very bad PR. With the 84k otoh, it will be a long time before we need to mint anything. You can have an \u201cX days since MKR was minted\u201d counter for a milder PR meme if you want one. I\u2019m pretty convinced that it would be better to keep the MKR to pay out retention bonuses and avoid minting for as long as possible. ",

Agree.     wouter:  Burning seems a somewhat shortsighted attempt to pump the MKR price that really isn\u2019t necessary.   This is not my motivation. I am against having so much capital. It creates incentive to spend it inefficiently.     wouter:  We already have a very solid reputation when it comes to low token supply, and trying to make a big PR stunt about a manual burn event could very easily attract regulators\u2019 attention. It\u2019s one thing to have it as a protocol mechanic (with already a very high burn ratio!), it\u2019s another to explicitly decide to burn for PR effects.   I am against any PR stunts.     wouter:  Minting then creates again legal risk, and breaks the rule that MKR is only minted to save the protocol from insolvency.   Yes, legal risk is very good con argument. Maybe exploring this further would be wise.     wouter:  I\u2019m pretty convinced that it would be better to keep the MKR to pay out retention bonuses and avoid minting for as long as possible.   That\u2019s the reason i suggested partial burn. I feel 84k is too much. I am changing my vote to abstain. Would like to hear more arguments. ",

However: our primary goal surely has to be the long-term sustainability of MakerDAO/stability of Dai. I\u2019m not sure whether burning meaningfully serves this, though I agree that minting (a related question) would be a very bad look. Is there a priority in the Surplus Buffer? I.e. are we happy that it\u2019s filling fast enough for where we\u2019re at right now and could be in the near future. While I\u2019m very impressed with how Liq2.0 performed, I think the severity of the recent crash and the strain on the system surprised most of us. Had Liq2.0 been rolled out a month later, or even conditions on the day been a little different (e.g. a slower bounce) things could have gone VERY differently for MakerDAO and, by extension, much of DeFi. It\u2019s probably not an overstatement to say it could have ended it or set it back years. So I\u2019d say that if there\u2019s any question the SB isn\u2019t adequately funded, let\u2019s get our house in order. Sell e.g. 15k MKR, fill the SB to 100 million Dai, and burn the remaining 69k. I\u2019d hope and expect the market would recognise we\u2019ve got our priorities right, taking care of immediate risk but proving that it won\u2019t be something we do again by burning the rest. ",

The funds were already taken out of circulating supply when they were sent to the PauseProxy. We\u2019ve seen how the market does not care at all about FDV, so I believe the potential positive PR impact of a large burn of funds outside the circulating supply is minimal at this point \u2013 especially if we instead introduce a meme of uncertainty about future mints on an ongoing basis, which we know will happen instead as Core Units start to vest MKR. Having what can be perceived as a treasury I\u2019d argue makes Maker seem less risky, and that has its positive PR implications as well. Furthermore, the community already has to make tough decisions regarding spending of surplus, so saying that there\u2019s a risk of inefficient spending or cognitive overhead is not a risk that applies only to the MKR in the PauseProxy, but to the project in general. MKR can be minted and inefficiently spent by the community as well, so I\u2019m not sure I follow the argument here. Another point is that these funds actually provide flexibility as we can potentially avoid future ideological debates and contentious gridlocks around MKR minting in the community by keeping this stack of funds around. I do not think minting MKR for rewards or other opportunities in general is a topic that has been fully debated yet, so burning these funds without a proper understanding of the community sentiment regarding minting-at-will (which would be the direct consequence of burning the funds) might just put us on a path of future problems. Therefore I argue that we should keep the MKR for now so we can at least cover the costs we know are coming, which are the CU incentives, and trust that the governance processes are strong enough to properly handle the remaining funds.

The only time I hear people talking about these 84K MKR is in the context of wanting to burn it. Even if there were proposals to spend it, I trust the MKR community to come together and evaluate any proposals on their own merits. The optics of burning it for short term PR benefits are not very good especially when we would have to turn around and mint MKR for CU retention. IMO we shouldn\u2019t touch the MKR until our Surplus Buffer / CET1 ratio are at the level the Risk CU recommends - we are FAR below that at the moment. Let\u2019s not forget that we have to pay CUs out of the Surplus Buffer as well. With markets as volatile as they have been, I\u2019d prefer to not touch the Foundation MKR. ",

First, it is work, it costs gas, it takes time, it entails (very small) risk, and it achieves nothing useful. There is no reason for MakerDAO to alter how much MKR exists in this fashion. At best it is completely useless. In reality it is worse. Original MKR supply was arbitrary but simple. No need to muddy it. MakerDAO has protocol level mint and burn mechanisms. There is no need to complicate that. This entire conversation is a distraction.  There is an illusion of massive funds generating thoughts on \u201cwhat to do with it\u201d.  Burn that idea, not any MKR. I urge those voted to burn or Abstained to change their vote.  If you do not, I may feel compelled to post a [Campaigning] topic and ask you a second time. 1 Million MKR were minted. Period. The protocol flops (mints) and flaps (burns). Period. It is simple.

Traditional companies buy back their shares because they deem the shares cheap or can\u2019t figure out a better way to spend their cash. So two questions to answer here:   Is the process of building the MakerDAO ecosystem complete with massive Dai adoption that no funding at present or future is needed? (Minting new MKRs would undoubtedly be bad for MKR prices if we decide to burn what we have.)   In the future, will MKRs eventually be liquid enough for large institutional investors, even pension funds, seeking a stable return to come in? If you think the answer is yes, then the focus should be on gradually getting MKRs in the hands of more people.   ",

If these are not burned, it does mean that from an accounting standpoint, total equity is reduced to account for the fact these tokens no longer circulate but are still outstanding. This should not come as a surprise as price*total MKR tokens = market cap is clearly not the actual equity of MKR holders until you subtract the 84,000 tokens held in treasury. Whereas, if they are burned \u2013 and actually all of the burning Maker has done to date \u2013 needs to be accounted for in one of several different methods. I suspect this is a massive headache for whomever has the unenviable task of trying to make a guesstimate balance sheet for Maker, since some of the methods require knowing what the original paid-in capital was (the original sale price of the tokens). I suspect we have not been tracking this (I\u2019m not sure how you could without access to the Foundation\u2019s books), so were I the person in charge of that, I\u2019d probably prefer that the 84,000 not be burned, simply because it represents a significant amount of the tokens outstanding, and the number already burned are small enough to (with a footnote or other disclosure) ignore until we can really try to sit down with the Foundation and get all the information they have on their books to figure out what the paid-in capital was on original and BT token issuance to be. It\u2019s pretty simple to deduct the 84,000 from equity, but likely a bit of an information hunt to coordinate with the Foundation (or maybe we don\u2019t, since I\u2019m not sure what happens when transferring contra equity to a successor entity?) how these would affect retained earnings or paid-in capital. That Maker is a bit of an accounting frontier and the unusual transition from Foundation to DAO of liabilities like debt guarantees (DAI outstanding are probably guaranteed debts for which we accept a premium to be the guarantor?) coupled with whatever basis the Foundation\u2019s MKR are really makes this a nightmare. I think that @SebVentures is stuck with trying to hold together the rough draft financial statements until we can actually get them done in a more detailed manner, so I would suggest anyone voting on this defer to him as to his preference. The distinction between burned and not burned is not functionally different, but one or the other may save some grief in trying to get our books in order. ",

If we deposit this MKR there, it might be too much of a governance risk.   Fair enough it is probably a bad idea, but as a general idea it is equity. They can also disable lending on collateral. But yes I was one of them  to worry about aave and since the last vote the amount decrease and voter increase, I think we should thank people to have done it. And I am also way less worry since I realized nexos was the biggest one into AAVE. So I am sure it will move away if their found are at risk. ",

                    "content": "My 2 cents, I abstained, not because I\u2019m against a burn but I would prefer to see that MKR (at least partially) distributed among executive voters, proportional to their vote count over the years and irregardless of the amount of MKR they voted with. It would bring extra MKR into circulation which would add downward pressure on the price for a while but also increase peoples voting weight for those who actually participated in and supported governing the system over the years at the benefit of the entire Ethereum ecosystem and versus those just holding MKR surfing on the actions of others. I\u2019m also pro air-dropping some MKR to vault owners to increase distribution some more. In short, partial burn, partial reward for voters, partial airdrop to vault owners. All numbers to be discussed of-course if this has support from others. anecdotal but still \u2026  twitter.com    \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 MBA, CFA, FRM, CFP, NGMI, HFSP, HENTAI (DegenSpartan)  the best part about my $MKR strategy is that i do fuckall and the hardworking community pumps my bags while i scream autistically at them that its a piece of shit twitter.com/DegenSpartan/s\u2026 \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 MBA, CFA, FRM, CFP, NGMI, HFSP, HENTAI @DegenSpartanscenario 1 (default scenario): $MKR goes to $0 and my bags go to zero, but im right - always have been  scenario 2: MKR holders are pissed off and pump it, im rich  checkmate losers https://t.co/0EYHoycrWk https://t.co/pYFVHmRIQJ    2:44 AM - 31 May 2021     120          2            ",
