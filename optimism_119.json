Reading time: 12 mins \ud83d\udd51 Likes: 34 \u2764       Optimism Alignment: Rocket Pool facilitates liquid staking, and the ability to become a node operator with less than 32 ETH, without compromising on Ethereum\u2019s core values. Rocket Pool is open source, decentralised, permissionless, client diverse, and non-custodial. Node Operators: The Rocket Pool protocol currently has 1,261 permissionless node operators, making it the most decentralised liquid staking protocol. rETH stakers: Liquid stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool and receive rETH in return. In the event of a slashing, the node operator\u2019s 16 ETH, and then their RPL collateral are penalised first, to protect rETH holders from this risk. Benefits: In light of recent discussions regarding self-limiting of staking pools above a certain threshold of staked ETH market share (15%, 22%, 33%), it is net positive to promote the growth of a decentralised liquid staking protocol below this threshold level. Promoting rETH liquidity on Layer 2 provides users with access to a liquid staking derivative (LSD) for ETH whilst also maintaining and supporting the decentralisation and security of Ethereum, and thus also Optimism. It further democratises access to ETH staking, by providing opportunity for users that cannot afford the transaction fees necessary to acquire rETH on Layer 1 mainnet. Proposal for token distribution: OP tokens will be utilised to incentivise adoption of rETH across the Optimism Layer 2 ecosystem through a targeted liquidity mining program. How will the OP tokens be distributed? rETH liquidity should primarily be targeted against ETH, in addition to the other major trading pairs on Optimism. Accordingly, we propose the following allocation of $OP for liquidity mining rewards:  70% $OP - A main Balancer/BeethovenX rETH/WETH pool 30% $OP - Velodrome rETH/WETH pair  How will this distribution incentivize usage and liquidity on Optimism? Liquidity for LSD\u2019s is fundamental to achieving adoption, volume and TVL in the context of rETH liquidity pools on decentralised exchanges, and also to drive growth in other applications that integrate with rETH, and Optimism as a network. There is already 1,387 rETH on Optimism, and it is well positioned to incentivise further adoption. Additionally:  The ecosystem is becoming increasingly aware of the issues of centralisation, lack of client diversity, and concentration of staked ETH among a small number of staking providers. Increasing liquidity for rETH will attract users to Optimism, as it will provide an affordable route to access a decentralised liquid staked ETH token. Liquid staking derivatives are an essential money lego in any DeFi ecosystem, and promoting rETH liquidity increases the utility of Optimism applications for end users. rETH demand and adoption is growing, including recent integrations with Ribbon finance, and the final stages of integration with MakerDAO as a collateral option. We anticipate demand will continue to grow, and incentivising liquidity on Optimism will allow Optimism to capture this growth too.  Why will the incentivized users and liquidity remain after incentives dry up? Liquidity begets liquidity. The promotion of rETH liquidity on Optimism facilitates the possibility of further integrations, which create new usecases that drive further demand for rETH within the ecosystem and continue to promote liquidity. This has been evident on layer 1 mainnet, where current integrations are now being approved following the increased liquidity of rETH. We expect the incentivised liquidity to accelerate integrations which will allow rETH to be used as collateral in lending protocols, and as a yield bearing token in LP positions and other money legos in the defi ecosystem. The inherent staking yield for rETH means it is well positioned to sustain demand, and foster ongoing sticky liquidity and TVL on Optimism. Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed? The OP tokens allocated will be distributed over a 6 month period, commencing two weeks after the allocation of $OP grant tokens. How much will your project match in co-incentives? A Rocket Pool governance vote will be raised shortly to determine whether co-incentives will be issued from the Rocket Pool treasury. ",

There is a very strong case that this proposal should be supported, precisely due to the risks of centralisation posed by Lido and Centralised Exchange staking providers. For clarity, Rocket Pool is decentralised.  There is over 1200 permissionless node operators on the Rocket Pool network, compared to approximately 30 permissioned node operators for Lido. The Rocket Pool team does not stake ETH on behalf of users, nor does it choose a small permissioned set of node operators perform this task. Anyone can be a node operator on Rocket Pool, if they have the appropriate amount of collateral (much the same as a solo validator on the beacon chain). It is non-custodial, Rocket Pool does not hold the ETH of stakers, nor have access to it. Neither does it manually match ETH from rETH stakers to node operators - this is performed by a smart contract. Similarly, when withdrawals are enabled, this will also performed by a smart contract. In terms of market share, Lido has approximately 31.8% of the total market share of staked ETH, compared to Rocket Pool at 1.8%.  I completely agree with your concerns around the risk of centralisation. In my opinion, supporting a decentralised staking pool, with a smaller market share, is the best possible way to address these risks, and protect the security and decentralisation of L1, and Optimism as an L2 which inherits these attributes.

                    "content": "Hi folks, I\u2019m a Rocket Pool community member and wanted to toss out my 2 cents: We don\u2019t have a budget to match a relevant amount of incentives. Perhaps a symbolic match could be possible if the goal is to see skin in the game?  LDO incentives budget (per a comment in the Lido proposal)  The Lido DAO\u2019s budgets for incentives and rewards programs have been upwards of 4.5M LDO monthly (e.g.: april, june), with overwhelming majority geared towards stETH. Depending on markets and price, this amounts to between $3M and $22M in incentives monthly.  RPL pDAO budget Budget is ~11k RPL/month = $100k-$500k/month depending on markets. This is not RP\u2019s budget for incentives, this is the total pDAO budget (the protocol dao is responsible for long term continued operations, which is a pretty big umbrella). At current market, matching 1M OP would cost more than 4 months of total pDAO budget, which I don\u2019t think is realistic. Again for emphasis - this is not our incentives budget, nor even our marketing budget - this is our total budget.  I encourage folks to look at Rocket Pool as being a significantly different animal than Lido. We have opted to be extremely decentralized. This incurs real costs, especially requiring node operators to take on all the risk and needing to incentivize that. It also has real benefits for the health of Ethereum in general. I have real fears that liquid staking becomes winner take all and that the winner has far too much power. RP is different in kind at this time: (A) we are starting from an order of magnitude lower market share; (B) the community is likely willing to self-limit in some way - we have talked about such things willingly before; (C) in the worst case, the amount of power that they\u2019d have as winners is much lower due to truly being decentralized - node operators need not even update their smart contracts if they don\u2019t wish to. I think Rocket Pool is very well aligned with the Optimistic Vision - in the end, a more decentralized liquid staking solution is well worth the incremental cost because it increases network security. Viewed this way, supporting Rocket Pool is partly to popularize liquid yield-bearing ETH to users on Optimism (yay $) AND it is also a public good to most effectively help secure the L1 we all rely on (yay security and decentralization).

                    "content": "Thank you to everyone for your feedback so far. To echo @valdorff, and to provide some further context regarding the practical barriers to Rocket Pool providing co-incentives:   The Rocket Pool protocol DAO (pDAO) treasury earns 15% of the 5% annual inflation of the RPL token, which since launch amounts to a total treasury of 75,367 RPL at present, or $872,000 at current prices. Given the extremely constricted size of the pDAO treasury, it is not feasible to try and emulate Lido\u2019s incentive strategy (which has a monthly incentives budget of $3m-$22m depending on market prices, which is many magnitudes larger than the entire Rocket Pool pDAO treasury)   The pDAO budget is undefined, and there is ongoing discussion regarding how to categorise the budget. There is not currently a budget for liquidity incentives at all, due to other priorities in a limited budget, including marketing, website design, and a community grants and bounties program.   Snapshot voting for pDAO initiatives and other governance processes are still in the process of being implemented.   The Rocket Pool community is strongly aligned with the values of Optimism and would love to offer matched incentives, however for the above reasons, it is probably unlikely that Rocket Pool will be able to provide matched incentives at this stage. I strongly believe that supporting rETH adoption is a worthy goal in itself, on the grounds of being a public good. Rocket Pool promotes the decentralisation of the beacon chain, whilst also acting as an essential counteracting force to Lido\u2019s dominance of the LSD market. We continue to welcome feedback on our proposal, and we are working on how best to incorporate this prior to progressing our proposal to the READY phase. Please feel free to share any additional questions, comments, or concerns you might have. ",

Additionally, given that Rocket Pool is likely unable to offer matched incentives, we are open to considering a reduction in the requested amount of $OP, as a reasonable compromise. By focusing on rETH/ETH liquidity, we should still be able to use a smaller grant request in an impactful way to foster rETH adoption on Optimism. @langers might have some further thoughts to share regarding this, and we will be sure to keep you updated.

They have a remarkable team, code is opensource so any vulnerabilities are much likely to be discovered and addressed in a dramatically faster form than conpared to projects that choose to keep their source code hidden. Perhaps more important is that Rocket Pool is also leading the charge on decentralization. Lido, on the other hand is quite different here, and although I think Lido is still a net positive, if you believe that having 24 validators means they are decentralized; more study on what makes a protcol resistant to censorship is needed. Rocket Pool will winout in the end in this niche, as the collective drive for freedom enabled by web3 - that can only be attained through real decentralization - is perhaps the most powerful rocket fuel in the world. Can\u2019t wait to support the Rocket Pool team!!!  ",
