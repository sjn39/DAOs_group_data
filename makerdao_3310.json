I don\u2019t think that the MKR Governance should be examining each single agreement we have.

We should promote the spawning of these initiatives without forcing them under the umbrella/control/direction of other Core Units.     Tosh9.0:  Does anyone else think that makes us look silly?   If this will eventually make us look silly, we can just stop the Core Unit and halt the activity (related to MakerDAO at least). ",

I felt the comment toward Aaron was sarcastic and merely wanted to reiterate @juan in saying that if you want to convince people of your point of view, attacking the intelligence of someone engaging with you and calling this proposal a \u201clooney tune idea\u201d isn\u2019t the most constructive way to go about that. To your point about the \u201cneed\u201d for this type of thing in DeFi, it\u2019s definitely a value judgement. From my end things like Unisocks show the powerful effect some swag plus a bit of marketing can have. That is to say, we wouldn\u2019t be the first DeFi project exploring the use of swag and I think this proposal was made in good faith. You clearly don\u2019t agree with the effectiveness of this and that\u2019s super valuable feedback, but will likely fall on better ears without the personal attacks. I am genuinely curious what place you think marketing should have as we go forward without the Foundation, that insight would probably inform some of the opinions you\u2019ve shared on this thread.

I\u2019m worried about the appearance of self-dealing on a couple different fronts, and for no real control over branding since we can\u2019t license MakerDAO\u2019s logo and brand.

Welcome to the CULPS #06. Today we have the MakerDAO Shop, MDS-001. The two guys proposing this are Coulter Mulligan and Mike Porcaro, and they will be explaining what they are trying to achieve and hopefully answering all our questions. For more episodes of the series, follow this link    Presentation  MakerDAO Shop Core Unit with Coulter Mulligan and Mike Porcaro (00:45)  1920\u00d71080 103 KB   1920\u00d71080 68.3 KB   1920\u00d71080 115 KB   1920\u00d71080 65.7 KB   1920\u00d71080 77.6 KB   1920\u00d71080 76.2 KB   1920\u00d71080 73.2 KB   1920\u00d71080 71 KB   1920\u00d71080 73.9 KB   1920\u00d71080 121 KB   12:07 \u2014 Andrew Burban: I like this idea of no funding requiered from the DAO, that it\u2019s all self-funded. I do think you should vest a little bit \u2014 maybe a portion of the profits, 5%, 10% goes into vesting back to you   13:27 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Let\u2019s say that Nadia\u2019s team is organizing some kind of event in Colombia next year and they need one hundred t-shirts or something. Would that be the retail price or would they have access to a special price or we\u2019ll see it on a case-by-case basis\u2026?   15:06 \u2014 Payton Rose: What does it mean to you to be a Core Unit? Further down the line, more ideas for merchandise come\u2026 Do you see yourselves trying to incorporate them, staying independent\u2026?   18:04 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Guys, I hear that you\u2019re speaking a lot about profit in the proposal. Let\u2019s say a t-shirt costs US$10 to produce. What would be your suggested retail price? How much profit would we be looking at?   20:28 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I\u2019ve usually be warned against going into partnerships where you share the profit and not the revenue, because it\u2019s extremely easy to just make up costs. So potentially you could say \u201cYeah, we need to invest on this, we want to put a store on this, we want to pay ourselves salaries\u201d, and then there\u2019s no more profit to share. So even if you say that instead of 50% of the profit  you\u2019ll share 20% of the revenue, at least it\u2019s a number that can be very easily measured and it\u2019s harder to manipulate   22:49 \u2014 LongForWisdom asks a question in the chat about shipping   23:23 \u2014 Planet_X: I have a question \u2014 or rather a comment about the website shop.makerdao.com. You want this website permanently. Some in the community might not be entirely comfortable with that. You could turn that thing into anything. If it has the MakerDAO.com name on it, I think a lot of people would want to own it. You could have the rights to the site for a number of years, but the name shop.makerdao.com belongs to MakerDAO   24:44 \u2014 Planet_X: I have a comment regarding the 50-50 profit sharing. Part of what you\u2019re selling here is that the community doesn\u2019t really have to get involved, but with a profit sharing someone at some point needs to go to your books and look into your numbers. Would it be possible to add a fixed fee\u2026? Let\u2019s say you sell a t-shirt for US$20, and then US$1 or US$2 is just a fixed fee to MakerDAO. Because then you would just have to set up the website\u2026   27:03 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: There\u2019s some topics that I would like to discuss, especially concerning the exclusivity and potential stop of activities. This brings me to one central point that we may want to touch upon later\u2026 While this may sound like a great idea, and maybe it is\u2026 I don\u2019t if I am personally in measure of actually evaluating this, and I\u2019m almost sure that most MKR Holders don\u2019t want to. So that\u2019s why I saw this more of as a kind of agreement between some Core Unit that deals with this type of things, and they can discuss with you and potentially other people and say \u201cHey, this is great. We\u2019re doing the due diligence, we evaluate these guys\u2026\u201d \u2014 so it\u2019s more like the same way we are delegating to S\u00e9b for Real-world assets\u2026   33:20 \u2014 PaperImperium: My questions are: first, where does the MakerDAO logo, swag, artwork, and stuff\u2026 where does that IP reside now? And secondly, anything that\u2019s cooked up for this, whether your relationship to the DAO would \u2014 should any ties be severed in the future, where would those designs for t-shirts, mugs, whatever, where would they go? Because if it\u2019s classified as a work for hire, it would reside with whatever legal entity is doing business on behalf of MakerDAO, whereas if it\u2019s just a straight-up licensing agreement, it would probably reside with the artists, though of course it would also include intellectual  property that belongs to MakerDAO   38:12 \u2014 The one concern that comes up to me is that, if the Maker logo intellectual property is open-source, this doesn\u2019t grant us control of messaging with the brand; but at the same time association with us\u2026 the big thing that we are offering you is a competitive advantage, however big or small it may end up being with the use of the URL\u2026 Seems like perhaps it might be better for you just to rent the URL from us rather than go through all this and have a more at-arm\u2019s-lenght relationship rather than try to make this a Core Unit, since it doesn\u2019t grant us any additional messaging power if anybody with an etsy shop is free to set up their own swag   39:36 \u2014 Payton Rose: I was wondering if you had any numbers of revenue or profit from the time operating under the Foundation   42:16 \u2014 Discussion around what should and what should not be a Core Unit ensues   46:15 \u2014 LongForWisdom: I think people will be understanding of stuff like this. If you get signed up as a Core Unit now, and later it turns out that it probably falls below the threshold of what makes sense as a Core Unit, I think people will be understanding and you\u2019ll just get shuffled into a different structure but will remain the same   48:27 \u2014 iammeeoh: I have one question that I think it\u2019s related to what you were discussing: What if we vote for this Core Unit to be formed and to run but we change our mind in one year or six months? What about your business? Would you accept to stop selling merchandising about Maker or with a logo of Maker\u2026? Basically to stop the business. Would you ask us for a time frame of six months of notice before asking you to stop?   50:11 \u2014 Payton Rose: This proposal is kind of unique in that you\u2019re proposing no funds from the DAO, so I guess initially there wouldn\u2019t be that kind of automatic retesting or reevaluation phase. I think that could be some valuable feedback, just say \u201chey, let\u2019s either put this up for vote or have a community report\u201d, or do something six months out as a retrospective   51:28 \u2014 PaperImperium: Maybe we can just come up with a nice fixed rate, make it easier for everybody\u2026 I mean, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having an official shop, but it seems like if we can\u2019t grant you an exclusive license, much less enforce one, that also means this is much less of a symbiotic relationship and more of just a straight up licensing deal\u2026   54:23 \u2014 iammeeoh: I think the idea of the Core Unit originally was, you know, you have some contributors that do something for MakerDAO and you want to structure this group of contributors in a way that\u2019s scalable, so the people inside this Core Unit work and they are coordinated by this Facilitator who is in charge of communicating with Governance. That\u2019s the general idea. Everybody is free t do whatever they want in the ecosystem of Ethereum, of DeFi, of MakerDAO. It\u2019s not a partnership, basically   56:15 \u2014 Andrew Burban: I want to look back around to the idea of the marketing\u2026 Is there going to be a maketing Core Unit? I guess there is none right now. This could maybe be like the subsidiary of the marketing team. I do like the idea of this being a Core Unit. Maybe this would be a subdivision of what marketing is rather than looking for a rent relationship\u2026   Outro  Juan Guill\u00e9n Mike and Coulter, where can people find you if they want to give you feedback or get in touch with you?

For those of you who haven\u2019t seen it yet, we added two posts today that will be very relevant to the meeting:     MIP39c2-SP15: Adding AmaZix Marketing Core Unit, AMZX-001 RFC       AmaZix has received a lot of feedback regarding our Marketing Core Unit proposal submitted on June 9th. While we have engaged in discussion about some of these items, we have taken all of this feedback seriously and are in the process of making significant modifications to our original proposal. We expect to release that proposal early next week. But we want to take this opportunity to provide a preview of some of the enhancements you will see soon.  Instead of focusing on historic accomplishmen\u2026         MIP39c2-SP15: Adding AmaZix Marketing Core Unit, AMZX-001 RFC       Dear all,  we would like to spend few words regarding AML provisions in a decentralized context.  Who\u2019s writing had the chance to work in DAO and blockchain since 2012. We personally followed THE DAO case and the mayhem originated by \u201cThe Attacker\u201d and the ensuing Ethereum hard fork.  As probably already highlighted in this chat and well known, the whole architecture of decentralized organization and cryptocurrencies is intended to remove middle man and make transactions permissionless.  Governm\u2026     Looking forward to next week\u2019s call! Best regards Paolo ",

Today we have the Governance Alpha Core Unit, so we have LongForWisdom with his team and they will be presenting the mandate, what they are planning to achieve, budgets, and personnel-to-be. For more episodes of the series, follow this link   Presentation GovAlpha Core Unit with LongForWisdom (00:43)  GovAlpha Core Unit Introduction1920\u00d71080 67.3 KB   Mandate1920\u00d71080 157 KB   05:30 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: How do you see neutrality? Is it more like making sure that all the possible points are covered in a discussion, potentially taking sides that you don\u2019t agree with, or is it more like making sure that everyone\u2019s voice being heard?   06:59 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: How would you think that things would work if there were no governance facilitation?   08:10 \u2014 David Utrobin: Do you think that Governance Facilitators have a duty to bring up the things about certain proposals that might be hidden from the author? Should Facilitators try to surface obvious issues in whatever might be overlooked by the community?   09:26 \u2014 Amy Jung: You speak a lot about current processes and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an aspect of the mandate that has to do with new processes or even about improving the current governance process, may that be something small or it could be drastically different.   Team Structure1920\u00d71080 138 KB   13:38 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: When you say Facilitators, potentially that means that the MKR holders will vote them to also be part of this core unit as Facilitators, right?   14:01 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: How would you try to make sure that the quality is there for a contributor to become a Facilitator? And once that\u2019s done, how do you see them to be ready to be a Facilitator?   15:42 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: You\u2019re going to be aiming for three Facilitators. It\u2019s probably ideal to have an odd number of Facilitators for agreement reasons. But in the case that there are two or four or something, do you have a formal process for Facilitator decision-making within the Facilitators?   Team Membership1920\u00d71080 118 KB   19:47 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Do you potentially see, like, hiring more people or getting more people to contribute, or do you think that this would be a pretty solid team for what you need in the short term?   21:04 \u2014 David Utrobin: Do you see a world where you would have the full-time MIP Editor or somebody from the GovAlpha team look over the entire MIPs cannon and make proposals around ways to make things more efficient et cetera? Does your core unit cover those kinds of projects?   Quarterly Focus1920\u00d71080 170 KB   25:23 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n:    26:30 \u2014 Tim Black: I\u2019m curious about the operational manual. The forum itself is a bit of an intimidating place to onboard through. Do you envision that being adjacent to the forum or\u2026?   27:47 \u2014 Frank Cruz: With regards to SourceCred and incentives to keep people motivated, how do you plan on dealing? Is that a job for you as far as keeping the community members focused and not burnt-out?   30:28 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I want to echo what Amy was saying in the chat, that sometimes people have a hard time navigating the governance of Maker, or the community. It\u2019s not very evident since the structure is very flat compared to other hierarchical models.   31:39 \u2014 What does your team foresee as far as streamlining the whole governance process? Is that something you are going to push for? Are you going to make a push for automating governance this way?   34:06 \u2014 Frank Cruz: And how close have you come to choosing another Governance Facilitator, like your Second-in-command?   Budget Breakdown1920\u00d71080 127 KB   37:12 \u2014 Frank Cruz: I think you\u2019re missing the health benefits and the MKR vesting options.   38:38 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Potentially you won\u2019t need it in the next three months, but eventually you might need to cover events or offsites or something like that.   39:10 \u2014 David Utrobin: For part-time contributors, what\u2019s your approach? Are you giving them a partial salary or are you tracking hours carefully and doing it through an hourly rate?   40:12 \u2014 David Utrobin: What kind of expectations should Maker Governance have with regards to self-reporting on progress, blockers, etcetera?   Vote on-chain now!1920\u00d71080 105 KB   41:47 \u2014 Payton Rose: Right now it doesn\u2019t seem to be a large need for a legal structure for the GovAlpha team, but is that something you thought about or something you can see in the future needing to take place in terms of having to pay contributors or different entities\u2026?  Outro Juan Guill\u00e9n Long, where can people find you and ask you questions directly about this? (43:19). Thanks, everyone, for coming.  Credits @blimpa produced this summary. Everyone who spoke and presented on the call, listed in the headers. ",

Today we\u2019re hosting another Core Unit Launch Pod, and we are in session #7. My name is Juan and I have the pleasure of having here David Utrobin. He will be telling us everything about the Governance Communications Core Unit and how he plans to bring more\u2026 I\u2019m out of words, David, so I need your help on this one.

Do you envision working with a legal Core Unit or a general counsel Core Unit when it comes to putting out public disclosures? Or is that something that the communication teams can take on their own?   29:40 \u2014 Frank Cruz: If regulation comes into fruition one day and, say, your team has to file something similar to what public companies do, which is a 10-K, if you had to file something crazy like that in the future, is that something you would handle or is that something that the legal teams have to handle?   21:58 \u2014 Frank Cruz: When it comes to emergency response, how would your team handle something like what happened on Saturday night Eastern Time, early morning in Europe, that big sell-off? Is that something that the emergency portion of your Core Unit would come out and say \u201cHey, so-and-so number of votes got liquidated, everything looks good\u2026\u201d?   24:15 \u2014 Frank Cruz: This is just a small example, what happened this Saturday night. I think the OSM was delayed, it wasn\u2019t changing, and Nick had to tweak it a bit and get it going right because the price wasn\u2019t updating. I guess that\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t get on Twitter in the middle of the night and say \u201cWe are tweaking the OSM. One-hour delay. We\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s back up and running\u201d. Is that something your team doesn\u2019t do?   26:20 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Maybe to follow a little bit on what Frank is doing, obviously this Core Unit is supporting other Core Units, and that\u2019s great. Is there something you would say \u201cThis we own and it\u2019s only our Core Unit that will do it in a vacuum\u201d, or pretty much everything is a little bit cross-functional?   28:20 \u2014 Elihu: I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019ve added the voter engagement part into your mandate and I would love to hear more about it, whether you\u2019re planning any specific action on this subject or if it\u2019s still in the planning phase   30:15 \u2014 Elihu: In terms of reaching out to a wider base of voters, are you planning on opening any new channels or are you sticking to the existing ones?   31:42 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I have a question about the roadmap. I was wondering if you have a very high-level plan that you were thinking about sharing it or you were going more like \u201cLet\u2019s see if we get voted, and if the DAO wants us to do the job we\u2019ll start working on that\u201d   35:40 \u2014 Payton Rose: As a Facilitator, David, do you have a particular philosophy? How do you see yourself operating and running this Core Unit in terms of growing it for the future and keeping it on track?   39:09 \u2014 Nadia \u00c1lvarez: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible, but it would be amazing if you could include information from other DAOs, if other DAOs are talking about Dai, about Maker, if we have to be aware of something, that will be super awesome. I don\u2019t know if you have considered that. The other thing is that last week we had this little issue with Coinbase custody, so the Maker Holders that had MKR in Coinbase custody couldn\u2019t vote. It would be great if your Core Unit could manage these third parties who are involved in the process of voting, because communicating is related to different things, not just telling anyone what\u2019s happening but also anticipating to this kind of events. So if we are close to a date where everyone has to vote, talk to Coinbase custody or other custody solutions to see if their system is working well and if we can help them in some way. That\u2019s my suggestion for your Core Unit   45:46 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Following up on Nadia\u2019s point, how do you envision your work with delegators? That\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to soon take off, I hope   47:06 \u2014 Frank Cruz: I guess one day you see yourself reporting why five delegates went one way and seven went the other way\u2026 They can communicate through you and push their narrative to the left or to the right   48:18 \u2014 Frank Cruz: I saw that Artem is the full  project manager. Artem, are you going to be doing lunch meetings once the pandemic is over and inviting stakeholders over?   51:31 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: You mentioned that you\u2019re a proactive person. Can you give examples of situations where you were proactive and you initiated things and made them happen?   53:43 \u2014 Juan Escall\u00f3n: I have a question regarding legal organization. Are you going to incorporate a legal entity? If yes, what are your thoughts and your needs about this?   55:28 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Regarding the timelines, do you know when you\u2019re planning on submitting this?   Outro  Juan Guill\u00e9n Anything else you would like to say before closing the call? (57:29) Thank you, David, and thank you, everyone, for coming   Credits @blimpa produced this summary.

Welcome to the Core Unit Launch Pod Sessions #01. In this case, we have the Growth Core Unit. Nadia and her team are here to talk a little bit more about how they are going to approach this project in general, the budget, and the whole MIP. For more episodes of the series, follow this link   Presentation Growth Core Unit with Nadia (00:35)  1920\u00d71080 160 KB   1920\u00d71080 163 KB   1920\u00d71080 195 KB   1920\u00d71080 172 KB   22:09 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: I think Gustav mentioned the methodical approach. How do you work to onboard the partners, identify them, see how the process is\u2026 What are these tools that you use both individually and as a team? 32:37 \u2014 Tim Black: There\u2019s quite an overlap with the Integrations team. Is that correct? Am I understanding right?   34:54 \u2014 Gustav Arentoft introduces Georgy Sokolov from Wirex 41:43 \u2014 Jen Senhaji introduces Nadia Taiga and Andy Alekhin from Snark.art 48:45 \u2014 Mariano DiPietrantonio introduces Henri from Buenbit   55:19 \u2014 Frank Cruz: This is going to be a post-Foundation movement. How do you think you\u2019re going to scale Dai compared to the previous 12 months? 01:02:28 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: How would you recommend MKR holders to judge your performance moving forward? 01:06:02 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: How do you define when a partner is actually onboarded? Is it when they have Dai in their product or is it when they sign or when they commit\u2026? 01:07:28 \u2014 Frank Cruz: Luis, you\u2019re into xDai out in Venezuela. I was just wondering how others are handling the issue with the gas prices? How\u2019s Buenbit dealing with this? And how important is it for the Maker Community to move to a Layer 2 or should we stay on the Layer 1 and let Dai make its way to Layer 2 on its own? 01:11:57 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Can you walk us a little bit through the budget? What are you guys thinking in terms of salaries, incentives\u2026? How are you planning on incentivizing the team?  Outro Juan Guill\u00e9n Thanks again for coming. It was great having you. If you want to know more about this proposal and the team, you can look it up in the forum, where it\u2019s properly tagged. We\u2019ll see you soon.  Credits @blimpa produced this summary.

Welcome to Core Unit Launching Pod Sessions #03. Today we have the Smart Contract Core Unit. Derek is joining us to present their mandate, budget, and himself as Facilitator. The vesting topic was heated up, so today we\u2019ll try to focus mainly on the Smart Contracts Core Unit implementation and not in vesting in general for the Maker community.

In my experience, that\u2019s a different skill set to development work. I think I felt that\u2019s potentially missing where we are now compared to where we were or when MCD was designed.

How long does it take before a new person is able to contribute?   Team Incentivization1920\u00d71080 258 KB   35:29 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Does this mean that, if there were 100 developers joining and staying for four years, we would dilute Maker by 10%?   38:06 \u2014 LongForWisdom: If it\u2019s 10% over four years, that\u2019s 2.5% per year, which is not really that much assuming that we burn nothing and assuming that we have 100 people that are getting 0.1%. I think the point is that the magnitudes aren\u2019t huge.   39:24 \u2014 LongForWisdom: Maybe a little bit off-topic, but from a Governance perspective I\u2019d actually be pretty happy if everyone who was involved got 0.1% over four years because that\u2019s quite good at distributing Governance power.   39:39 \u2014 Amy Jung: I have a question about these four years. How did you get to four versus three or five or something?   41:52 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Are you thinking about any type of cliff, Derek?   42:35 \u2014 LongForWisdom: I think the one-year cliff makes sense. You don\u2019t want people just bailing in less than that time, but I\u2019d maybe consider making these subsequent cliffs more like a continuous scale rather than like cliffs. Because it kind of sucks to be stuck in a job that you don\u2019t like for an extra six months because you\u2019re waiting for some vesting cliff. Or viceversa, if you do decide to leave, it feels bad if you leave after six months and you get none of the vesting [\u2026] Free discussion ensues   45:58 \u2014 Andrew Burban: We can maybe mint if the minting cannot be unlocked until we\u2019ve burned a certain amount, but in general I\u2019m very anti-mint [\u2026] I think having the printer button just there is very tempting and can lead to unintended consequences that I think are dangerous. If we\u2019re going to allow minting, we need to have very strict codified limits [\u2026] I\u2019m much more pro taking it from the burn [\u2026] Free discussion ensues   56:46 \u2014 Juan Guill\u00e9n: Potentially, using the burning function is going to\u2026 You\u2019re incentivizing people to burn a lot, so maybe they will say \u201cOk, we should not research L2. We should onboard more tokens because that\u2019s more burning. So we\u2019ll receive more MKR compared to potentially growing it more in the long term and suffer from the vesting during those months\u201d. I don\u2019t know if we want that. Free discussion ensues   57:31 \u2014 LongForWisdom: Another interesting question is: assuming that the MKR treasury gets burned \u2014which is obviously not guaranteed\u2014, are you then feeling better about minting, Andrew? Free discussion ensues   01:00:56 \u2014 Planet_X: This has to do with the coordination. You said on these slides that you coordinated with the other groups. Is this in some way coordinated with the Oracles team? Because after you there will be an Oracles Core Unit, I guess. As a community member, what I really don\u2019t want is for you to get packaged A, B, C, something, and then the Oracles team come out with their proposal, and what they propose tops everything you got. So, is this reasonably coordinated with the Oracles team?   01:02:30 \u2014 LongForWisdom: I just want to follow up and say that\u2019s kind of my main concern at this stage as well, that either we\u2019ll get into a situation where Governance is feeling like they have to kind of pay out all these small vesting things because the first one was 0.1% and now they\u2019re all that; or I don\u2019t want to get into a situation where the next Core Unit comes along and says \u201cWe want more\u201d, \u201cWe want less\u201d, and then when you\u2019re half down the line, someone is feeling dissatisfied with the amount of vesting they\u2019re getting in comparison to some other core team. To some extent that\u2019s going to be unavoidable, but I feel like maybe if we have some sort of more global or system setup that covers multiple teams\u2026 Maybe that\u2019s beneficial.   01:08:39 \u2014 Frank Cruz: I heard Derek said something about possibly looking at L1s in the near future. I was wondering if your team was well-versed when it comes to working with Rust, Vyper, WASM\u2026 How does that look? Is that a 2024 event or is that something that maybe can come a little earlier like 2023?  Outro (01:12:30)  Juan Guill\u00e9n Thank you, everyone. So, Derek, where can people find you? (01:12:33), Potentially give out your address if they want to go with their pitchforks. Big thanks to the rest of the Smart Contract Team for coming and answering all our questions  Credits @blimpa produced this summary.
