Thank you for joining Collateral Onboarding Call #47. I am Retro from the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit. Today I am joined by BlockTower Credit to discuss the recently submitted MIP6 application requesting a $150M initial debt ceiling to fund super-senior, asset-backed credit secured by short-duration real-world loans and credit receivables. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

What are you most excited for in the next five years? 28:37 - PaperImperium: For funds flows, does BT require an intermediary (like HVBC and 6S use), or would BT directly receive the DAI? If an intermediary is required, can you provide some background? 33:25 - Frank Cruz: Can you please expand more regarding your proposed \u201cfixed\u201d stability fees? What is your thinking behind the proposed 4% SF? Why is it important that the stability fee is fixed? 37:59 - Robert Jordan: Can you comment on the portfolio and active management? 41:36 - Akrasia: How large is the junior tranche on these deals, and what is the yield on them? 44:21 - Robert Jordan: Can you comment on the utilization of the MIP21 and MIP22? 46:46 - Akrasia: In that context, MKR earns 4% on their senior stake, correct? Is this comparable to what a TradFi lender would expect from this risk profile? 49:56 - Tim B: Will this presentation end up on the forums?   Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 53:34  I want to thank the BlockTower Credit Team again. We would be happy to host you for a follow-up session anytime.
