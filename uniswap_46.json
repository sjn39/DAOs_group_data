The current lending rate for Dai on Compound is 6.83%, so there is a simple arbitrage there, however, Compound rates fluctuate rapidly so that is one risk. Alternatively, Uniswap governance could borrow Dai using some part of its treasury and use some part of the remainder to provide liquidity on the UNI/DAI pair without having to sell UNI for stablecoins. The Dai could be swapped for other stablecoins to provide liquidity on other pairs. The Maker community would be excited to have Uniswap as a customer. Currently Maker supports a similar treasury vault from the Yearn protocol, and it\u2019s exciting to see more of these protocol-to-protocol partnerships develop. ",

Like @zenithlight mentioned, Yearn is currently in discussions to onboard a new vault with high collateral ratio, higher debt ceiling and lower fees. This ensures that Maker can safely take on more volatile collateral while producing more DAI and also giving the borrower better rates. If I wanted to push this idea forward through UNI governance more, what would be the best steps? I think this would be an especially good use for the Uniswap Grants program so you could pay out recipients in a stablecoin instead of UNI while still catching the UNI upside as the protocol continues to gain value. Not to mention its kind of hard to weaponize billions of dollars in illiquid tokens! I could put you together with our rates group or growth team to hash out a proposal. Let me know! ",
