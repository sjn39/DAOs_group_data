This was primarily for reddit, as most of you already know all of this. Please comment with additional questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this information and how it is presented. Disclaimer: This document will change as the situation evolves and was produced with funding from the Foundation. Thanks! Important Points  The Migration contract debt ceiling is now set to zero in preparation for the Shutdown of Single Collateral Dai.  This means SAI can no longer be converted for DAI through the migration contract, but DAI can irreversibly be converted to SAI. (if this causes issues for your Dapp reach out here)  The MakerDAO community and MKR holders are targeting April 24th for  Shutdown Once Single Collateral Dai  Shutdown begins, SAI holders can immediately redeem 1 SAI for 1USD worth of ETH (ETH price locked at Shutdown). CDP owners must wait for a cooldown period (currently 6 hours) to end before retrieving collateral through a web interface  Detailed Summary - Shutdown Requirements and Reasoning On March 27 Derek Flossman, a product manager with the Maker Foundation, laid out the required steps to safely Shutdown Single Collateral Dai (SCD) (1). The first step involved an executive vote setting the DAI-SAI migration contract debt ceiling to zero. This passed on April 9th (5). A reminder, the migration contract acts as a special type of vault, which accepts SAI as collateral and mints DAI. Reducing the debt ceiling to zero means SAI can no longer mint DAI, but DAI can (irreversibly) be redeemed for SAI. Derek explained that after the Shutdown of SCD SAI represents a claim on ETH, whose price is fixed at the moment of Shutdown. Normal fluctuations in ETH price theoretically would track to SAI, and since the migration contract swaps SAI to DAI 1:1, this could expose DAI to ETH\u2019s price movements. Therefore, once the debt ceiling is set to zero, DAI should be pushed through the migration contract, draining it of all collateral SAI. Currently 3.3 million SAI remains in the migration contract. No specific plan for draining the migration contract was presented in Dereks report, but active development of one is underway according to a rocket-chat communication (1). After users drain the migration contract, MKR holders can safely initiate SCD Shutdown. A governance poll (which only signals MKR holders opinion) affirmed intentions to enact the Shutdown of SCD on April 24th (6). For Shutdown to actually occur MKR voters need to pass an executive vote which calls the cage function in SCD. This executive vote will also define a cool down period in which keepers must bite all SCD CDPs before CDP owners can retrieve excess collateral. No liquidation penalty or discount for keepers exists once cage is called. Biting all CDPs is necessary only for system accounting purposes. Currently, this cool down period is expected to be 6 hours, but may change depending on market conditions. Note, CDP owners via a CLI, can retrieve their collateral during the cool down period, but could experience an unfavorable PETH/ETH ratio as SAI holders redeem collateral and keepers actively account for system debt. SAI holders can redeem SAI for ETH as soon as  Shutdown begins. (1) By initiating Shutdown, without utilizing the tax function, MKR holders forgive outstanding stability fees. The current consensus, based on the poll in (2), shows the communities belief that stability fees should be waived. These details hopefully help users trying to understand exactly what will occur during Shutdown. The context of why the community and MKR holders want to Shutdown SCD is explored below. Context - A central question remains: why Shutdown SCD at all? To engage with this question requires historical context, in the Maker community the question of when, if, and how to eventually Shutdown SCD has been deliberated since the deployment of MCD. The arguments at that point (Nov-Jan) primarily revolved around the resource drain of maintaining both systems simultaneously. In SCD Shutdown, no clear mechanisms exist for recovery of outstanding stability fees, so debate often revolved around how and why MKR holders should extract those outstanding fees. This turned out to be a quite complicated endeavor (4). Another reason for the debate, highlighted by almost everyone, was that community agreement on SCD Shutdown specifics would be necessary to effectively communicate to the public. In January 2020 community member @Aaron_Bartsch, maintained a forum signaling thread polling the various heuristics the community might want to use to determine when to Shutdown. The highest polling metrics were peg deviation, time passed, and SAI supply, the community showed they wanted SCD Shutdown if the peg deviated more than .05$, SAI supply fell below 10 million or if 6 months passed. SAI price only flirted past the five cent deviation on several occasions, the supply recently fell below 14 million, and 6 months haven\u2019t passed, so these metrics never ended up provoking further steps to close SCD(3). No consensus on stability fees was achieved either (4). These past efforts informed the present debate, but ended not determining Shutdown parameters. On March 12th, the Covid crash (or Black Thursday) brought significant chaos to the Maker ecosystem. Once the community had some grasp on the immediate situation in MCD, the topic of SCD Shutdown resurfaced in a forum signal request (again through @Aaron_Bartsch), partly because risk team member @Primoz highlighted liquidity, liquidation, and stability issues within SCD in a governance meeting. In this forum thread, somewhat chaotic debate ensued and the immediate market situation dominated the Shutdown related considerations. Many expected further crashes in ETH price, and MCD had its own problems still, so the majority of community members came to the conclusion that SCD Shutdown was the wisest option. Other community members highlighted that a subset of the community considers MCD insecure and that shutting down SCD breaks MakerDao\u2019s promise of a decentralized stable coin. Regardless, the majority of participants on the forum generally agreed on SCD Shutdown and the waiving of fees. The subsequent MKR governance votes appear to affirm the majority\u2019s sentiment. Eventually, the Signal Request resulted in multiple polls determining the Shutdown date of April 24th and the decision to forget about capturing stability fees (2). The sentiment gathered in this thread pressured the devs to detail the technical considerations of how to begin SCD Shutdown (1). This brings us back to the present situation. Communication of MakerDAO\u2019s actions and reflections continues to progress as this initiative deepens along with our collective experience. These efforts are born out of a recognition that communication failure has occurred and continues to require more attention.

I also want to add that CDP 3088 has worken up, purchased enough MKR to pay fees but likely will simply not close his CDP down because it will save him approx $1M  in fees as well as additional fees to source significant DAI liquidity to extract the SAI.   Literally if this position were to close it would put significant liquidity strains on the MCD DAI system as well as the SCD SAi system likely driving up the PEGs to 1.04 or higher if attempted.   This would add at least .3-.5M of additional cost to this user. I think the fee issue here is moot given MCD DAI minting is at .5% but could crank up if the MCD SF on ETH moves up.   So lets just get the SCD DC down to $14M ASAP. I think community should be prepared for CDP 3088 to become vocal but hey if I can avoid like 1.3-1.5M in costs to close I think I would be rather happy for the free loan so I would address any bitching in that context.   What we don\u2019t want to do is set up for more SAI minting with a 20M DC. ",
