                    "content": " MIP55c3-SP5: MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer  Preamble MIP55c3-SP#: 5 Author(s): @ACREinvest  Contributors: Tags: spf, meta-governance Status: Withdrawn Date Applied: 2022-06-22 Date Ratified: yyyy-mm-dd Amount Requested: 525,000 DAI Recipient Address: TBD   Sentence Summary The MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer Special Purpose Fund will pay legal fees and expenses to retain Kianga Daverington, Esq. through @DaveringtonPLLC as full-time Interim Chief Legal Officer of MakerDAO for a period of six months.  Paragraph Summary [TBD]  Motivation MakerDAO faces a number of challenges and opportunities that require legal review, analysis and expertise across a wide spectrum of areas including governance, operations, product and strategy. Being a fully decentralized autonomous organization is MakerDAO\u2019s greatest strength and asset for realizing its full potential in the years ahead. At the same time, the absence of DAO legal personhood frustrates its ability to: (1) to engage counsel on behalf of the DAO as a whole and (2) act directly as a counterparty in real world interactions. The current state of decentralization at MakerDAO and its distributed governance model via Recognized Delegates lacks adequate legibility and accountability for the risks and responsibilities resting with each natural individual participant and his/her/their organizational affiliation within the DAO. Efforts underway to redesign or improve governance and incentive alignment throughout the DAO require more than just an economic lens. We require a thorough and robust understanding of the global regulatory landscape both for the protection of participants and for safe-guarding the protocol\u2019s ability to provide its products and services to the world. ACREinvest believes that in our role as an Independent Delegate we represent the best \u201cproxy\u201d to serve as a client within the framework of an attorney-client relationship. We are in the unique position to have a Founder who is also an attorney admitted to practice law in the State of New York, United States and maintains a separate law practice, Daverington PLLC. Kianga Daverington has the flexibility, desire and ability to serve MakerDAO in this expanded capacity for a crucial interim period of heightened market risk while community consensus forms on the longer-term improvements needed in governance structure, tokenomics, strategy and operations.  Special Purpose Fund Name MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer  Special Purpose Fund Scope & Work Credentials The MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer Special Purpose Fund (SPF) will be used to retain the law firm Daverington PLLC and appoint Kianga Daverington as Interim Chief Legal Officer of MakerDAO. The purpose of engaging Kianga Daverington for this role is to address the vacuum of full-time senior leadership in the areas of legal and regulatory compliance that impact the DAO as a whole, Recognized Delegates, Core Units and other contributors.  Deliverables  Day-to-Day Leadership, Coordination and Support of DAO-wide initiatives involving matters of legal review and regulatory compliance including, but not limited to:  RWA Capital Raise AML/KYC Legal Review of MIPs LTS CU Treasury Operations Decentralized Workforce For reference:   Embedding legal analysis on new governance proposals SES Incubation Announcement: Legal and Transaction Services Core Unit (LTS) [Discussion] The DAO needs a serious discussion about legal structure - #43 by mlphresearch Self Insurance Fund - Update Grant Announcement: KYC/AML Compliance Research - #34 by layerzero FATF Guidance (Crypto vs. AML) and Maker - #11 by MakerMan [Discussion] Capital Raise Methodology for Review of MIP6 Structured Finance Transactions Real World Finance: Decision-Making and Delegated Committee Proposal      On behalf of Recognized Delegates, review of legal opinions and other confidential or private information belonging to potential counterparties and proposal applicants, consult with internal legal teams and external counsel as needed. Event: Organize and host a DeFi Continuing Legal Education (CLE) workshop for practicing attorneys to be held at the Yale Club of NYC in Q3-4 2022. Maintain Weekly Open Office Hours for the community Monthly written reports to and discussion with Recognized Delegates Legal Talent Recruiting & Workforce Human Capital Management Planning New York Law Legal Memo to ACREinvest as Recognized Delegate of MakerDAO addressing risks and responsibilities of participating in delegated governance on behalf of MKR holders. Establish and lead a MetaGovernance Oversight Committee (MGOC) via MIP46 \u2013 Parameter Proposal Groups submission. Similar in structure and operation to the MakerDAO Open Market Committee (MOMC), the MGOC would monitor and manage any governance obligations and opportunities associated with the DAO\u2019s ownership of governance tokens in the MakerDAO treasury. The MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer Special Purpose Fund Scope is limited in duration to funding 6 months of legal services and expenses. Funding will go to ACREinvest for the payment of legal fees and expenses to retain Daverington PLLC and Kianga Daverington in the role of MakerDAO Interim Chief Legal Officer for 6 months at a flat-fee of $500,000. Kianga\u2019s legal credentials are summarized on the @DaveringtonPLLC website.  During the scope of these 6 months, ACREinvest will pause its non-MakerDAO initiatives, other than support for ACRE DAOs, a tokenized impact investment community. Kianga\u2019s only other work commitments during the period will be fulfillment of her responsibilities as an Advisor to and multi-sig signer for the Climate Collective Treasury. See:  https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/60 The Climate Collective Treasury - Governance - Celo Forum The Climate Collective Treasury [v2] - #14 by Pinotio.com - Governance - Celo Forum    IMPORTANT: The legal services proposed here are in no way a substitute or alternative to any current requests/proposals for funding legal resources internally or via outside counsel. Rather, the additional provision of Senior Management legal oversight is necessary for the successful coordination of all legal and regulatory issues and services. The need is particularly acute in the short term until MakerDAO can implement its longer-term strategy for workforce management and oversight.  Funding Breakdown  Retainer agreement signed between ACREinvest and Daverington PLLC - 250,000 DAI disbursed. Conclusion of 6-month engagement - 250,000 DAI disbursed. Documentation of expenses paid to host CLE event, travel and meetings \u2013 up to 25,000 DAI as incurred per 1USD=1DAI.

I\u2019m comfortable providing legal advice technically to myself and business partners in ACREinvest as a client on certain questions given the risks, uncertainty and unsettled laws that may be applicable. ACREinvest will gladly share the memo with other delegates for their information, but it could not be relied upon as legal advice pertaining to any entity other than ACREinvest. Here I refer to:     ACREinvest:  New York Law Legal Memo to ACREinvest as Recognized Delegate of MakerDAO addressing risks and responsibilities of participating in delegated governance on behalf of MKR holders.   No attorney-client privilege or relationship would be created between Daverington PLLC/myself and any other participant in or stakeholder of MakerDAO. Thus my statement that the relationship is the best \u201cproxy\u201d I can think of to get some research done on key issues by someone who intimately understands what a DAO is, DeFi and what the community is looking to achieve. The day-to-day Interim Chief Legal Officer role otherwise is comparable to an \u201cin-house\u201d position if MakerDAO was a company. So sharing my perspective with other Delegates would not only be based on a New York law analysis, but as a General Counsel-type role would include input from other relevant counsel engaged where and as appropriate. The role would not be part of SES or any Core Unit incubation program, but accountable directly to MKR holders via governance.     flipflopflapdelegate:  How are you viewing the Self-Insurance Fund that SES has put a lot of work into these past 6 months, versus your proposal?

I am not too worried about an actual centralisation of power with her as Chief Legal Officer, but I am concerned about perception risk - how this appointment could make Maker itself seem like a centralised entity. It\u2019s vital for Maker to continue to act as a DAO (emphasis on the \u2018decentralised\u2019). We can\u2019t risk MKR being seen as a security, and that risk increases when Maker looks like a company (complete with c-suite) as opposed to a permisionless software project. Ironically, appointing a Chief Legal/General Counsel could help a regulator argue that MakerDAO owes legal and compliance obligations as a financial institution. ",

Doo_StableLab:  Why is it ok this time for you that you are a delegate but also requesting budget and taking a different role for the Maker protocol? How is this different from your criticism of @PaperImperium making proposals that he\u2019s part of multisig (which I personally don\u2019t find it as an issue) or me and Monet working as CU and Delegate at the same time. Unlike previous cases, this directly goes to your budget so there must be an explanation.   As for conflicts of interest, none of ACREinvest, Daverington PLLC or Kianga Daverington have investments in or plans to launch businesses or crypto projects that compete with MakerDAO. None represent or provide services to customers or clients which would create a conflict from the perspective of legal representation. I have not expressed any objection or concern about CU members also serving as Delegates.     swakya:  re: this proposal,  Does this subsumes @ACREinvest\u2019s activity as a delegate or comes in addition to it? Is there overlap with @christiancdpetersen\u2019s work?      No. ACREinvest is a separate legal entity and business that will continue to operate and fulfill its Recognized Delegate responsibilities. Kianga Daverington will continue to be the determiner of views and votes for the platform.   No. Please see \u201cImportant\u201d note above:       ACREinvest:  IMPORTANT: The legal services proposed here are in no way a substitute or alternative to any current requests/proposals for funding legal resources internally or via outside counsel. Rather, the additional provision of Senior Management legal oversight is necessary for the successful coordination of all legal and regulatory issues and services. The need is particularly acute in the short term until MakerDAO can implement its longer-term strategy for workforce management and oversight.       MFeinberg:  I think we need to avoid using the titles such as Chief Legal Officer as that could impact perception.   Title is not important. For purposes of this proposal it is the best legacy system framework to clearly communicate the scope, responsibilities and accountability required. Happy to consider alternative descriptions for the SPF and role.     layerzero:  I deeply appreciate your interest and efforts in working on the legal challenges and tasks that MakerDAO needs. We need indeed your expertise. However, I respectfully disagree with this approach. I don\u2019t find it appropriate to put in place a C-level Manager in a DAO.   That\u2019s totally fair and I value your perspective. This proposal has come about as a result of many private requests for my leadership and support in this and other areas which would require a significant commitment of time (full-time and over-time, frankly), exclusive focus and application of actual work as an attorney. I have also taken cues from the wider community discussions which suggest this project DOES need a better management model. I am fiercely pro-decentralization and anti-hierarchy. However there is a vacuum here that\u2019s a grave danger to this project succeeding long term. If I can be of service in this capacity, it would be an honor and a privilege. No views expressed to the contrary will be held against anyone! ACREinvest will continue in our current role with enthusiasm no matter the outcome of this proposal. ",

As soon as you have the overlap between delegates and core units the DAO no longer has a reasonable way to internally maintain a balance of power and you need sone kind of external check i.e. regulators. And really, there is absolutely no reason why every single CU wouldn\u2019t immediately spin up a delegate if its tolerated, since it just puts them in a so much stronger position. I am aware that Monetsupply right now is an exception and has overlapping roles as both core unit contributor to risk and delegate, and now it is spreading it is definitely causing me to reconsider my own delegation to him since that may be a part of the confusion that consolidated contributor/delegate power centers are reasonable.

As a community, we are already navigating the legal issues.  We would hope to draw from people with expertise such as @ACREinvest in order to respond to regulatory changes.  My hope for MKR is that we place our trust in our community over the opinion of any one entity regardless of their experience.   I am generally against paying for future work that is not clearly defined.  This may be controversial as it is not always how the CU structure works.  But I am more for rewarding accomplishments.  I believe that being a token holder or even a potential token holder who simply believes in the vision of this project needs to be enough for people to contribute.  There are of course critical needs that require full time employment but MKR cannot be expected to give an income to every single contributor for every kind of expertise.  This precedent has already been set and that is why we continue to see proposals where people request salaries for themselves.  @ACREinvest you are already in a position of influence and widely respected in this community.  But when someone requests income, it leads me to believe that you believe MKR is not worth your time unless you are paid what you are worth.  This will always be true to some extent as one must make a living but this request is of a much greater magnitude than that.  Given that you already dedicate some amount of hours per week as a delegate, how many more hours would we be getting per week out of you.  I am here because I like being part of something that can change the world and I simply want to contribute.  And if I truly believe in it, I can make my income by investing in MKR and then working my hardest to make the vision a reality.  (Something akin to what @rune is doing with his endgame proposals.)  This is an appeal to all contributors.   We are not in the position to be spending more money.  What a bear market gives you is time to build.  We should build features.  We should optimize inefficiencies.  We should integrate RWA.  We should nurture relationships.  But what a bear market takes away is capital and in order to build, we need to conserve our capital.  MKR is in decent financial position but we are not clearly profitable right now and in order to build, we must stay solvent.  As a community, we will do our best to respond to regulations but my belief is that our focus should be on building this protocol.   ",

                    "content": "The problem is real. But this proposal offers the exact wrong (and an extremely dangerous) approach.  Decentralization Issues Consolidating the DAO\u2019s legal power in one person (legacy 3rd person references notwithstanding) is completely antithetical to what any DAO should stand for. I\u2019ve already spoken to folks in SES (which apparently was not consulted on this proposal) that understand this dilemma. There are DAOs such as LexPunk that consist of decentralized groups of attorneys collaborating on ways to provide advice & representation to DAOs without having any centralized chokepoints and minimizing legal attack surface. We should be inspired by groups like LexPunk DAO. The idea of a CLO is exactly what we should be standing against if our goal is an increasingly decentralized future for this DAO.  Organizational Issues Proposing a C-level executive for a DAO is, in and of itself, a wildly radical idea. But in addition to this, CLOs often become the most powerful people in any organization that has weak leadership - even stronger than CEO. MakerDAO has weak leadership by design so it is safe to assume that a CLO with vested powers as proposed could easily & single-handedly determine the direction of the entire DAO. MakerDAO should not have any single person with this type of vested power - CLO, CEO, CMO or otherwise.  Ethical Issues The idea of a delegate sending a $500k 6mo engagement for themself to an on-chain vote without any prior checks & balances may not be breaking any DAO rules, but it is ethically questionable and rules should be codified that disincentivize this type of thing from happening in the future. It is far too easy for someone to use this type of process for an otherwise preventable power or cash grab. @ACREinvest, I\u2019d like to suggest the following:  withdraw this proposal take a look at what LexPunk DAO is doing work with interested parties (incl myself) to develop strategies that minimize centralization & trust as much as possible while still addressing the DAOs legal-ish needs  most importantly: support ongoing decentralization efforts within the DAO to reduce legal attack surface as much as we possibly can while still maintaining the DAOs core function & mission  ",

You\u2019re asking Maker to pay you $500.000 in order to get legal counsel from yourself. Getting this legal councel enables you to speak on behalf of the protocol in all legal matters (which is, for practical purposes, all matters) despite having the backing of 0,6% of all available MKR tokens. This is an endeavour that requires a full time and overtime engagement, yet it still leaves enough time to not impact being a Maker delegate and still leaves time to run support for ACRE DAOs. You also don\u2019t see a conflict of interest that you will get first access to priviliged information as a delegate. Furthermore you will be in a position to influence what counterparties get of information from Maker. To try to illustrate my perspective. If you were in a race to get elected mayor, and another candidate had a business running political campaigns. Would you hire that firm to advice on your campaign? Even if he pinky promised it was a different legal entity. I have no reason to believe there is nefarious intent, but the optics here are terrible. You talk about decentralization but propose yourself to the most centralizing position anyone has ever had in MakerDAO with a very generous compensation package to boot. ",

None represent or provide services to customers or clients which would create a conflict from the perspective of legal representation.   I don\u2019t think conflict of interest only applies when working against competing protocol. As I mention on my delegate platform and recognize, I have conflict of interest with Growth CU. I vote regardless and also vote against Growth CU if it\u2019s not aligned with my core value but as Rune mentioned above, it\u2019s fair to point out there\u2019s conflict of interest. In similar reasoning, there\u2019s conflict of interest for you and the law firm. Especially when it contradicts your own thought on the role of delegate:    Expectations of a delegate   Judicial Approach Without there being an explicit mandate from the community for Delegates to operate in this mode, ACREinvest views the delegate role more in the vein of a Judiciary actor. Accordingly, from my perspective initiating proposals would not be appropriate especially if the proposal includes a paid role for the Delegate or an affiliate to provide other services to the DAO. Dispassionate neutrality across the entire scope of matters before the DAO is what I\u2019m striving for!   As the proposal includes a paid role for the Delegate or an affiliate to provide other services to the DAO, I believe it\u2019s good to review again and maybe withdraw the proposal or help SES team instead.

The RFC period is valuable because it may give a perspective that the author does not have and allow improvement on proposals (or, in some cases, withdrawal) based on the comments received. It\u2019s up to the proposal authors how much they engage during the RFC period. Proposal authors may be more likely to be successful when they address stakeholder concerns.  The following is GovAlpha\u2019s interpretation of this proposal as currently written. In the interest of transparency, @ACREinvest attended our public office hours to enquire whether MIP55 was appropriate for her use case. GovAlpha advised that it was appropriate if the proposal met the specified requirements for a MIP55 subproposal. As always, this is not an endorsement of the proposal but meets our mandate of guiding community members through the Governance process when requested.  This is an application for a Special Purpose Fund as detailed in MIP55. It requests a transfer of 525,000 DAI funding which the SPF will use to retain the law firm Daverington PLLC. The application lists a summary of the deliverables for the law firm. These funds will be removed from the Surplus Buffer. This arrangement will last for six months. GovAlpha is satisfied that these specific and temporary objectives meet the requirement to qualify for an SPF. To proceed to an on-chain vote, the applicant will need to identify a minimum of 2 comptrollers as defined in MIP55 who will act as signatories on the multi-sig wallet holding the funds. (@ACREinvest, this must be done before the frozen period, although the actual creation of the wallet itself can wait until after approval is granted by MKR holders if it is forthcoming). The multi-sig should at minimum be a 2/3 multi-sig, with the point of contact (in this case @ACREinvest) and at minimum two comptrollers as signers - it should follow the multi-sig guidance described in MIP47. This proposal will enter the monthly governance cycle because this request is for more than 50,000 DAI. Assuming the applicant addresses the abovementioned issue, it will be eligible to enter the August cycle. It would be on-chain for two weeks and would also be required to attract the minimum positive participation value of 10,000 MKR and achieve a majority of non-abstain votes to pass. This proposal has been given a high impact tag as it involves the transfer of a large sum of DAI from the Surplus Buffer.   tagging @Recognized-Delegates & @GovAlpha-Core-Unit for information ",

Doesn\u2019t that itself send the completely wrong message to regulators? Namely, that MakerDAO is already a corporation of sort, there\u2019s a C-level board, but no legal entity? Maker needs to become more clearly decentralized, more profitable and needs less governance concentration in the hands of the well-connected few. I\u2019m continuously awed by Kianga\u2019s insights, presence and speed of execution, but I see no way to support this proposal, nor do I think it is appropriate at the current time. ",

I don\u2019t disagree that there might be other avenues to explore and incorporate but this is a lawyer agreeing to take on fiduciary responsibilities, not some power grab. This is to protect the DAO which now has a myriad of potential liabilities that we have fortunately (luckily) avoided thus far. An attorney has a duty to put the interests of the client before their own. An attorney can be disbarred if these responsibilities are neglected. An attorney should (and usually does) have malpractice insurance for some of these very reasons. Without diving into the merits of the MIP, this is clearly not some autocratic power move. This is a highly qualified duly licensed attorney willing to take the risks associated with trying to limit the plethora of current liabilities. We can come up with ways to \u201ccheck and balance\u201d the role as well.     ChrisBlec:  We should then address this whole thing from a problem-oriented situation rather than jumping straight to a solution   When? This cannot wait. ",

                    "content": "As an attorney working in the Crypto and DeFi space, I accept that DAOs could do with some legal support for their off-chain interactions. And while I admire MakerDAO\u2019s desire to fully de-couple from off-chain entities such as the Foundation, this will soon become an impediment to development, not a virtue. One can still design platforms around principles of open-source censorship resistance and decentralisation while simultaneously protecting stakeholders, developers and users from legal risk. The legal risk doesn\u2019t disappear simply because there\u2019s a DAO. It just shifts focus until it finds a target. So, there\u2019s going to be a need for some company structuring and formal agreements. For now it\u2019s in those intersections between on and off-chain realities where the lawyers are going to earn their pay and this task should be given top priority. With that out of the way, there are a few serious problems with the proposal that need to be addressed:   The cost agreement being proposed is way out there. There is no full-time in-house counsel working in fintech earning anywhere near those sorts of fees. Here are some benchmarks of what CLOs earn, noting that the tech industry tends to pay only a tiny bit above average (but not much). Simply put - CLOs don\u2019t earn great money (I know from experience!) but the upside is better work-life balance (allegedly) and stronger relationships with the client.   I\u2019m confident I could put an offer through my own firm to provide legal support to the DAO\u2019s off-chain activities for about half the cost of the OP\u2019s proposal (assuming we can get the other complications sorted out). This is not a full-time role. 90% of the ongoing legal support for an established fintech operation doesn\u2019t involve compliance/regulatory work in NY. It involves getting the basics right: Select and establish suitable entities, draft NDAs, various service/supplier agreements, HR agreements, website privacy terms and Terms of Use (e.g. the MakerDAO homepage still doesn\u2019t have basic legal terms which unfortunately isn\u2019t uncommon in this industry), capital raising term sheets/SAFTs, OTC negotiations, (ahem) lending agreements, reviewing marketing collateral etc etc. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a huge legal team being managed or ongoing market disclosures or IPO to handle so the premium isn\u2019t justified.   As I\u2019ve done this type of role before for other DeFi projects, I\u2019d estimate about 60 billable hours per month which makes the OP\u2019s hourly rate $1400/hr or thereabouts. That\u2019s very high, even by NY standards.   It\u2019s premature to propose a 6-month retainer when the actual workload hasn\u2019t been fully scoped. Could I suggest a month or so at an hourly rate first to see what sort of workload and budget is involved so the client can focus the lawyer on important tasks? WIPs should be left to junior lawyers to save costs. Even if the DAO voted to appoint the OP as a CLO (???), there could be considerable savings here.   NY seems an arbitrary (and very unwise) jurisdiction to base this role when the Foundation was established in the Caymans and countries such as BVI/Caymans should be preferred over the US. Since the bulk of the legal support is likely to be in a common law jurisdiction, it seems prudent to hire lawyers who actually work in those jurisdictions.       ACREinvest:  On behalf of Recognized Delegates, review of legal opinions and other confidential or private information belonging to potential counterparties and proposal applicants, consult with internal legal teams and external counsel as needed.     Based on the above quote, the fees don\u2019t cover external legal support required by specialists (such as off-shore advisors). How much is being budgeted there? This doesn\u2019t seem to be included in the $500K fee so the DAO would need to pay extra for that work. Expect the final budget to be hundreds of thousands more than USD$500K.   To complicate matters further - the OP isn\u2019t working as a true CLO because in-house counsel only have 1 client, being the employer. To double down on the complications: who is the OP proposing is the actual client here?       ACREinvest:  The role would not be part of SES or any Core Unit incubation program, but accountable directly to MKR holders via governance.       ACREinvest:  No attorney-client privilege or relationship would be created between Daverington PLLC/myself and any other participant in or stakeholder of MakerDAO.   This isn\u2019t how client-attorney relationships work and contradicts the earlier quote:     ACREinvest:  On behalf of Recognized Delegates, review of legal opinions and other confidential or private information belonging to potential counterparties and proposal applicants, consult with internal legal teams and external counsel as needed.     Let\u2019s think this through: Yes, the OP is taking instructions from stakeholders. Yes, the OP is being paid handsomely by the stakeholders. Yes, the OP is accountable to the stakeholders. But No, the OP is not the lawyer for any stakeholder. Sorry, but no bar/practice rules anywhere in the world support that type of mental gymnastics. It might be a good idea to work out who the client is for everyone\u2019s sake.   Is this CLO building a team? If so, how does the OP plan to extricate themselves once the team has been established? I don\u2019t see this engagement ending after 6 months.   Could I suggest the members put this role out to tender (or engage a recruiter) to see what sorts of proposals come in? This process should be handled on a competitive basis to get best value-for-money for DAO members and other stakeholders.   ",

Also, there are some outstanding attorneys in the space who would charge a lot less at major firms, not including myself I don\u2019t have the bandwidth   Hi @LegalG, welcome! I agree with much of what you said. And, no, unfortunately it\u2019s not a joke. I will be voting against as well. I believe that @SESLegalResearch is working on a more decentralized alternative strategy that will result in more legal resiliency for the DAO and its members. That, combined with a continued effort to reduce legal/regulatory attack surface and reliance on overly-complicated RWA, is the right way to go. ",

I believe the long and hard work that @layerzero and others have put into this subject matter is the best path forward for MakerDAO. TBH, I\u2019m saddened that you chose to take this route via a powerful tool, MIP55. There\u2019s so many other unique things this community can accomplished via this tool. What breaks my heart even more is that you are one first people I admired when you posted early views on the future of Regenerative Finance (ReFi), a movement that is seeking to transfer control of capital to communities that are most affected by racial, climate and economic injustice. Which leads me to another thing that breaks my heart, is that I\u2019ve never seen you attend an EndGame DVC meeting to date. Did you know that the construct of MetaDAOs have the possibility of reforming some of the same things the ReFi communities believe in? I personally believe one way you can truly help MakerDAO is by giving the EndGame and the Reformer MetaDAOs a chance. A listen. Because after all, we All want this beautiful tech to change the game.

To be clear, a budget and an actual expenditure are different. In the case of RWF (probably the largest budgeted legal spend), while Maker did incur external legal fees for the SG Forge transaction, our overall legal fees to date have been much lower than budgeted. We were able to allocate many (but not all) legal fees to 3rd parties in the HVB deal. New Silver has agreed to pay Maker\u2019s legal fees as has OPM for the ADTC transaction. A discussion is still to be be had on the other pre-green lit MIP6 applications. Of course, I am compensated by the RWF CU.

Particularly in my case where specific expertise is being called upon. Over the past several months I have also learned the lack of consistent attention, accountability, information legibility and coordinated leadership around the areas I outline in the proposal are extensive and frightening. I am uniquely situated to assist in these matters and willing to contribute more actively, full-time for a specified period. The DAO is going around in circles on many issues and potential solutions. This is my offer to be part of the solution in the form of a governance proposal that can be voted on imminently, rather than just create more and more discussion and conversation that doesn\u2019t land anywhere concrete. My hope is that this work would be part of a convergence of census about what\u2019s needed and by whom (many people taking on additional responsibilities that facilitate informed governance, risk management and strategic focus).
