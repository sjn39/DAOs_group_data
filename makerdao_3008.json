I\u2019ve now got the first few documents in reasonable shape, and would appreciate one or more people looking over them and providing feedback. The goals here are to:  Increase knowledge of what each parameter is, does and why it does it. Highlight the main trade-offs to changing a parameter. Surface some lesser-known details of some of the important parameters.  Drafts are currently complete for:  Debt Ceiling Debt Floor GSM Pause Delay Liquidation Ratio Stability Fee System Surplus Buffer  I\u2019d love to receive feedback for these in any form. Once they\u2019ve been somewhat finalized, I\u2019ll be pushing for them to be included in the new community development portal and we\u2019ll link to them in polls and signal requests. As a sidenote, as a result of trying to write these documents, I\u2019m considering pushing for some terminology changes around some of the parameters. Let me know if you have any comments on this topic. Do the commonly used names of any of the parameters confuse you (or did they when you first heard them)? ",
