                    "content": "MIP25: Flash Mint Module Preamble MIP#: 25 Title: Flash Mint Module Author(s): Sam MacPherson (@hexonaut) Contributors: Chris Mooney (@godsflaw), Brian McMichael (@brianmcmichael), Gonzalo Balabasquer (@gbalabasquer) Type: Technical Status: Formal Submission Date Proposed: 2020-09-25 Date Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd> Dependencies: n/a Replaces: n/a License: AGPL3+  References  The proposed dss-flash implementation Declaration of Intent  Sentence Summary This proposal provides a smart contract implementation of Flash, a module which enables any user to execute a flash mint of Dai. Paragraph Summary Flash mints allow anyone to mint as much Dai as they need with the one condition that they pay it all back in the same transaction with a fee. This allows anyone to exploit arbitrage opportunities in the DeFi space without having to commit upfront capital. This implementation conforms to the description laid out in the MIP13c3-SP2. Component Summary MIP25c1: Definitions: defines Debt Ceiling (line) and Minting Fees (toll). MIP25c2: Proposed code: contains snippet of proposed implementation. MIP25c3: Test cases: lists existing test cases, including integration test MIP25c4: Security considerations: comments on the limited nature of the security implications of adding the Flash. MIP25c5: Formal verification/audit information: comments on the amenability of the proposed code to formal verification, even though formal specification, audit, or code review have yet to be conducted. MIP25c6: Licensing: states the license under which the proposal and code are distributed. Motivation Flash can provide many benefits to the Dai ecosystem including, but not limited to:  Improved market efficiencies for Dai. Democratization of arbitrage - anyone can participate. Exploits requiring a large amount of capital will be found quicker which makes the DeFi space safer overall. Fees provide an income source for the protocol.  Specification MIP25c1: Definitions   Debt Ceiling: The maximum amount of Dai any single transaction can borrow. Encoded as line in rad units.  Minting Fees: How much additional Dai must be returned to the Flash module at the end of the transaction. This fee is transferred into the vow at the end of a successful mint. Encoded as toll in wad units.  MIP25c2: Proposed code see flash.sol. The core minting functionality is simple: function mint(     address _receiver,      // address of conformant IFlashMintReceiver     uint256 _amount,        // amount to flash mint [wad]     bytes calldata _data    // arbitrary data to pass to the _receiver ) external lock {     uint256 arad = rad(_amount);      require(arad > 0, \"DssFlash/amount-zero\");     require(arad <= line, \"DssFlash/ceiling-exceeded\");      vat.suck(address(this), _receiver, arad);      uint256 fee = mul(_amount, toll) / WAD;     uint256 bal = vat.dai(address(this));      IFlashMintReceiver(_receiver).execute(_amount, fee, _data);      uint256 frad = rad(fee);     require(vat.dai(address(this)) == add(bal, add(arad, frad)), \"DssFlash/invalid-payback\");      vat.heal(arad);     vat.move(address(this), vow, frad);     emit Mint(_receiver, _amount, fee); }  The IFlashMintReceiver interface: interface IFlashMintReceiver {      /**     * Must transfer _amount + _fee back to the flash mint contract when complete.     */     function execute(uint256 _amount, uint256 _fee, bytes calldata _params) external;  }  MIP25c3: Test cases see flash.t.sol  test_dex_trade test_mint_with_fee testFail_mint_zero_amount testFail_mint_amount_over_line testFail_mint_insufficient_dai testFail_mint_too_much_dai testFail_mint_line_zero testFail_mint_unauthorized_suck testFail_mint_reentrancy test_mint_data test_mint_no_fee_payback test_preexisting_dai_in_flash  MIP25c4: Security considerations The proposed solution is simple and non-invasive, interacting with only one other component of the system (the Vat) through an existing method for suck. A lock modifier has been added to  mint to prevent any possible re-entrancy bugs. MIP25c5: Formal verification/audit information The proposed contract is written in a way which is amenable to formal specification and verification, in accordance with the style and practices of the core multi-collateral DAI contracts, though it has not been formally specified. No audit or code review has taken place yet. MIP25c6: Licensing  AGPL3+  ",
