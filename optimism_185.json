                    "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to make an alternate proposal than Enabling $OP as a gas token on Optimism Network!. This is an approach which mirrors PoS as well as Fuel Labs. This is not a token price scheme, please read the full post! EDIT: I found some relevant posts where implementation could be discussed: Use OP to decentralize the sequencer and Pragmatic first step towards decentralizing sequencer (this one has recent activity). I apologize for any duplication, although I think reviving the discussion of using $OP specifically (as a counter to less palatable proposals such as gas token) is still its own topic.  Major points  $OP as a gas token does not create revenue for $OP, it only creates velocity. Our objective is much more than to pump price via a monetary premium. Buy-and-burn is too manual, we should reserve monetary policy for spending needs. The revenue of a blockchain, when scalability expands to infinity, is MEV. Giving $OP tokenholders block-ordering rights directly securitizes the revenue into the token, which, in tandem with seigniorage and treasury diversification, allows the DAO to more flexibly fund public goods (real revenue does not always line up with the quantity of good projects to fund - we require monetary expansion and contraction of the treasury) Another benefit of decentralizing MEV is that you get better censorship resistance / liveness. Public goods funding should not have a centralized dependency on Optimism corporation. Although there are short-term gains to \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d by selling a token and keeping revenue, it\u2019s not good for the long-term brand / ability to fundraise and attract projects   The Economics This may seem to reduce revenue for the ecosystem fund (what the team refers to as \u201cpublic goods\u201d), however it may actually increase fundedness since if the ecosystem fund holds e.g. 20% of the $OP supply then they go down from 100% to 20% of current revenue but they can sell up to 20% of all future revenue and even print themselves a larger stake. Hence, if we believe the ecosystem to generate a lot of revenue in the long-term then securitization is the most sustainable and flexible way to keep the ecosystem fund wealthy.  How can it be implemented? EDIT: The below was based on a mistaken assumption on my part that the current iteration of MEVA would be conducted off-chain and/or privately between proposer<->builder a la Flashbots. In fact, \u201cwe simply repurpose L1 miners and utilize them as block proposers\u201d is a detail from the original MEVA post I had missed which simplifies the implementation as now the L1 contract directly can collect and distribute staking rewards, rather than a rotation of auctioneers. This also avoids randomness of returns for small stakers. See also @polynya 's comment.  sortition: give random $OP staker headstart in committing to L1 (get_beacon_proposer_index). should they also get an inactivity penalty? delegation: in-protocol delegation or in-protocol staking derivatives top-100 (Cosmos) vs slots (Ethereum)? there could be a tool like mev-boost so that the $OP staker can receive MEV blocks progressive decentralization: e.g. centralized entity still sequences 50% of the time  ",

Hi @raho no worries and I understand the defensiveness to any \u201ctokenomics\u201d.     raho:  It seems (based on your responses) that you\u2019d be suggesting MEV Auctions (MEVA), is that correct?   Yeah, I think building off that past work would be a promising route. In their original post they mention the roles of \u201cBlock producers // Transaction Inclusion\u201d (\u201cBlock proposers are most analogous to traditional blockchain miners.\u201d) and \u201cSequencers // Transaction Ordering\u201d. I think the \u201cBlock producers\u201d role is a natural fit for something PoS-like (actually it sounds like they intentionally leave that part open-ended as to who the block producers could be?) using Ethereum-like leader selection (I think get_beacon_proposer_index). Of course, we would have to figure out whether to do the 32 ETH thing or the top 100 thing (Cosmos-style), but either way delegation would be required, because \u201cat-home staking\u201d might be challenging and not likely to get many blocks.     raho:  I am mostly curious if this implementation could have any negative effect on users.   If someone stakes and is inactive, then the rollup root could get committed a bit late, but I actually think this would be fine because 1) there\u2019s already a 7-day dispute period, 2) could probably be discouraged with inactivity penalties. The broader risk is the $OP stakers produce worse blocks than the Optimism team. But I still think it\u2019s good to decentralize it. Finally to be clear on the implementation difficulty resources, this is definitely a major research undertaking that is being worked on across Ethereum, Optimism, other rollups, Cosmos, etc in collaboration so it definitely wouldn\u2019t be production-ready for a while! For example, I can\u2019t find any recent update from the team regarding MEVA but I trust that they are still working on it (since it is their plan for public goods funding). So that\u2019s why I\u2019m only staging this to \u201cIdeas & Feedback\u201d. If I don\u2019t start this discussion early, then much worse / less productive ideas will proliferate regarding what to do with $OP. ",
