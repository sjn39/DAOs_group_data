We are a tribe, and this is war.  We are long-term investors and UNI believers but if we don\u2019t take this seriously then there will be no more rainbows here. Long-term investors get stronger by drinking the tears of short-term speculators. So we need to start rewarding long-term investors by getting serious. We most certainly need to consider a UNI tokenomics program alongside the proposed buy-back program. We should welcome any sort of mechanism that supports price over time. Anybody who says otherwise is clearly a trojan horse from another community trying to steer us in the wrong way. I can\u2019t say too much, but I know for a FACT that a certain \u201cRich famous Crypto Twitter personality\u201d has supporters in here who on purpose, are making false misleading suggestions and start conversations to dampen the growth of UNI. Sushi  are taking risks because they are in second place. They want to take over Uniswap and they are fighting for it. They are not sitting there twiddling their thumbs about \u201clegal issues\u201d and cry baby garbage talk about upsetting the wrong people. Stop listening to these unproductive paper pushers. These are the same people who said Bitcoin was going to $0 in January 2019 because \u201cthe government will not let it go up\u201d. Now\u2026 There is room for only 1 king so we need to start acting like it.   We are here for Crypto, but let\u2019s not forget the most important fact\u2026 Satoshi already solved the \u201cDigital Scarcity\u201d problem. Stop acting like it\u2019s a bad idea to support the Uniswap with scarcity tokenomics such as buyback & burn, as well as incentives to hold the UNI token for longer periods of time. Clearly it was a mistake to leave the Protocol Fee Switch inactive for 6 months. This is way too long and a thorn in our side.  Nobody is happy about that because the \u201ccompetitors\u201d are making moves EVERY other day. We have basically let the sheep out for the foxes. We also need to stop wasting time replying to trojan horse actors who say \u201cGuyZ, BuYBaCkS DoN\u2019T HeLp, AnD BuRnInG DoEsN\u2019T EiTheR!\u201d in every single thread. It\u2019s so obvious that these people are from an outside community and actively trying to take us down from with-in. As a start, we should be implementing:  Staking \u2026Reward longer lock-up with higher yield. Buy-back and Burn \u2026There is incentive for holding as the Unicorn is working for us 24/7. UNI hodler access \u2026Own 25 UNI and you get access to cheaper fees and more trading features such as Stop Market, Limit Orders, Iceberg etc.) Loyalty Rewards \u2026Instead of 6% yield, you get 7% staking yield if you have been using for a longer period of time.  We should also heavily consider giving Liquidity Providers a payment in the form of slightly higher yield on their Staked UNI Tokens as this will punish those who keep dumping their bags early, and it will reward long-term views. It\u2019s time to stop playing nice and start working seriously towards total Victory  ",

Tes, UNI is king, and its our job to keep it that way but it\u2019s going to take time to think of a good plan. While I believe your propositions are interesting, they should be much more detailed for a consensus check. This is the last step before publishing a proposal and should be more fleshed out ! If you need any help, feel free to reach out. Also, and that\u2019s a personal opinion, delaying the treasury switch is a good thing because it helps us figure out the way we want to run things. ",

This poll can either be binary or multiple choice but you are required to include the option \u201cMake no change\u201d or its equivalent. Set the poll duration to 5 days.    Create a new topic in the Proposal Discussion category on gov.uniswap.org ti\u2026     Thus, the results of this poll might better reflect the voice of the community had it included the required option.
