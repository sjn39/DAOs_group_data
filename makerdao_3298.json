                    "content": "In the latest MakerDAO Risk Team Flip Auctions Report, you may have noticed lower Auction Efficiency for the ETH-B vault. To incentivize Keeper participation we may want to increase the \u2018beg\u2019 parameter (auction bid increment in %). A higher \u2018beg\u2019 should make Keepers more comfortable bidding earlier, placing less risk for MakerDAO. It should be noted that ETH-A does receive a lot of participation, though there is still benefit to MakerDAO if Keepers are more comfortable placing earlier bids for ETH-B. We may also want to increase the \u2018chop\u2019 parameter (penalty fee). Due to ETH-B\u2019s lower Liquidation Ratio, ETH-B vaults have a smaller asset buffer at auction compared to other vaults. This represents a greater risk to the MakerDAO protocol. A higher \u2018chop\u2019 will also incentivize vaults to be more cautious to not get liquidated. A side benefit of increasing Keeper participation is that we may be able to increase the \u2018Box\u2019 parameter. Cons:  A higher \u2018beg\u2019 may result in lower penalty fees collected by MakerDAO Higher \u2018chop\u2019 and \u2018beg\u2019 may result in less collateral being returned to liquidated vaults   Auction Efficiency may improve to counteract the penalty fee     Vaults are incentivized to not get liquidated       What should the ETH-B \u2018gap\u2019 be?  3% - No Change 3.5% 4% 5% Abstain     0 voters        What should the ETH-B \u2018chop\u2019 be?  13% - No Change 15% 17% 19% Abstain     0 voters     This Signal Request will run until Thursday, February 25th.

                    "content": "    Jiecut:  @LongForWisdom The counterargument is that the ETH-B vault liquidations has a substantially increased risk of loss for MakerDAO compared to other vaults.   Increased risk.  Based on what?     g_dip:  Is there a reason you\u2019ve left the stability fee out of the poll? I would consider that to be a third parameter which affects the overall safety of the Vaults.   Agree @g_dip. Stability fee, low Surplus, lack of a Reserve. I am back to a tiered vault approach in terms of risk management.  We just keep jacking up the DCs vs creating new vaults with different LR, SF and looking at risk and complaining.  If you want to change the liquidation fee - do it on a new vault and then just reduce the DC on the old one.  Why not poll vault holders on what they think about this?   I keep coming back to wanting to poll vault owners generally\u2026   I mean has Maker ever gotten feed back directly from vault owners other than when things fail or to get some info on how to improve the Maker experience?     ultraschuppi:  really? isn\u2019t this just affecting the collateral left after auction so it just hurts the vault owner?   The above statement is generally true.  in fact having a variable \u2018beg\u2019 was one of the many tools I have discussed in previous posts to help manage liquidation loads.  The idea here was when the system is getting hammered consider reducing the \u2018beg\u2019 to alter the LR profile to try to reduce the number of vaults that would come under the liquidation gun.   A significant alteration to the \u2018system\u2019 to be sure but conceptually one of many ways to deal with risk. I consider the primary way to reduce risk to be raising a reserve, surplus and then figuring out mechanisms to help vaults NOT get liquidated.   Either some additional fee for liquidation insurance or a DSR backing reserve to help buffer auctions.  Or as I suggested in the past a DAI-Rebate token dripped out for maintaining a high CR.   The concept here on a DSR-L was that when OSM-auction prices are disjointed you want a fund to step in to take a percentage of the collateral being offered at auction (at the auction price) in exchange for some extra return taking on the risk.    The point here is when auctions are fetching 80% or lower than the OSM to simply have this fund take on 20% of the liquidity at the auction prices.  50ETH out at $100 when the price is at $120 - the DSR-L takes the next 10ETH  at $100 etc.   If this gets worse and we are clearing 50ETH at $50 and the OSM is at $100 it takes 50ETH at 50 for each 50ETH sold etc. There are lots of ways to reduce the risk profile here - hurting your vault owners by upping liquidation fees may be great for Maker but it sucks for vault owners. Figuring out how to improve keeper liquidity or liquidation liquidity and maybe offering other vaults with Higher LRs with lower SF and lower liquidation fees and or dripping rebates for vaults maintaining a higher CR perhaps would yield better solutions and approaches to risk management than the above.

                    "content": "I had another thought regarding \u2018risk\u2019 in the Maker system. The risk of liquidations being tied to a single network (main net).   I will hazard an idea (which are plentiful) that might be rewarding in this respect.   Why not consider opening up the auction process to bidders with DAI on other L2s?    We already know mempool front running is a \u2018thing\u2019 with some miners even offering services to help front runners.   What if main net becomes so expensive and clogged during a liquidation event the only place to source liquidity reliably IS one or more L2s? The idea here would be to duplicate the liquidation system so that offers backed by deposited DAI could exist on multiple L2s and the \u2018system\u2019 properly constructed looks at these offers before closing the deal and locking the gem for the bidder?    If you want to talk about risk to this system I see one of the biggest risks being that the main net simply won\u2019t provide access to anyone but a privileged entity that has already backend gamed the situation to determine where the flaws in the system are and end up being uniquely positioned to take advantage based on network limitations. I know we are still in the throws of a liquidation upgrade but if you want more bidders why not offer up liquidations on multiple networks - particularly ones where fees to bid are low. Probably something to put in the Liquidation and systemic risk research hopper but if we have main net fees at 100-300gwei now - tell me where you think this lands when we have a price catastrophe like Black Thursday and how anyone is going to be bidding on anything with 2000-30000gwei network access gas.

But, a higher \u2018beg\u2019 can result in better auction efficiency. With the high gas prices, Keepers may be unwilling to start a bidding war when they can be easily outbid, so they don\u2019t try.
