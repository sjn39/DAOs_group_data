OK, next transaction is like this: Txn Hash: 0x0b957b5f94befe2575f53214d7a5938862cec7473a394c854c5d2b3f5b716dcf Gas Fees: Base: 131.296607397 Gwei |Max: 10,001 Gwei |Max Priority: 10,001 Gwei Gas Price: 0.000010001 Ether (10,001 Gwei) and the subsequent transactions are also high gas fees\u2026 So, I am confused of: I know that in ethereum(I read the source code of go-ethereum), the miner order the transactions with gas price, but why the transaction of 0x6583965a16987b36a0c5b16908717205f32125a31905954bd049e6301ae110fc with only gas fee of 131.296607397 Gwei is queued before so many higher gas fee transactions? I am really confused, anyone could help me to explain this? Thank you so much.  ",
