Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem.

To answer your questions:   To clarify, there is a general L1<>L2 communication bridge which will support arbitrary message passing and will be used for governance. The ETH and ERC20 bridges provide an interface for depositing/withdrawing funds, not used for governance.   We can include the \u201cDeploy Uniswap V3 Script\u201d for the License Exemption albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team.   Mostly true. Bridge validators can\u2019t pass an incorrect message or change the content of the message, the worst case would be to censor everyone. Importantly, we\u2019ll have these bridges audited by Tier 1 external auditors and have multiple points of security, including monitoring off and on-chain activity, generous bug bounty programs, etc.   ",

We are in favor of deploying Uniswap onto zkSync as it offers a faster and more cost efficient means of swapping cryptocurrencies. Also, the proposal will offer much more exposure to Uniswap V3 as a whole through offering the protocol on another secure network. If Uniswap V3 were to upgrade their protocol to V4, what would the transitional maintenance process look like and who would oversee it? ",
