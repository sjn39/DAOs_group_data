Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop-shop for MakerDAO updates.  The public PDF version is available here.   Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  KYC/AML Compliance Research Controversy The @SES-Core-Unit came with good intentions to announce their new grant involving know-your-customer (KYC) / anti-money laundering (AML) compliance obligations focusing on the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s updated guidance for Virtual Asserts and Virtual Asset Service Providers. The grant aims to act as a research and identify a selection of potential AML tools to be demo-tested. The community believes the grant goes against the ideology of what members of the DAO believe it to be, anti-compliance. Several people are worried that adding a KYC layer promotes bank-like characteristics for MakerDAO. The team responds to these concerns by explaining that the grant is mere research to help promote more decentralization and prepare the community against potential legal risk. Some of the community ultimately agreed to trust the process and believe we should be patient until receiving results from the research. Others misunderstand the objectives behind the grant announcement. Nonetheless, @SES-Core-Unit has the DAOs best interest at heart to educate everybody and improve the protocol\u2019s success.  Rate Limited Flapper On-Chain Recent discussion and signal request expressed that the majority of the community would like to introduce Rate Limiting into the Flapper to continue MKR burn, which is now on-chain (poll ends February 10th at 4 PM UTC). The @Protocol-Engineering Core Unit published more details on the Rate Limited Flapper.  This is a simple amendment that allows Governance to limit the amount of DAI that is allowed to be auctioned off at once, accomplished by adding the following two new parameters to the flapper contract; lid and fill\u2026  The next steps involve an additional signal request determining the correct DAI limited to be auctioned off at once. Solutions have already been written by @hexonaut, which will undergo an audit before implementation and successfully passing its on-chain poll.

The error has been detailed by the Protocol Engineering team on the MakerDAO forum here. In order to correct this error, the following changes have occurred:  The currently configured DAI budget streams for the StarkNet Engineering and Strategic Finance Core Units are canceled.  412,085 DAI was streamed to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at 0xf737C76D2B358619f7ef696cf3F94548fEcec379 starting at 2022-03-01 and ending at 2022-07-31 as a result of their most recent budget proposal.  214,583 DAI was streamed to the StarkNet Engineering Core Unit at 0x6D348f18c88D45243705D4fdEeB6538c6a9191F1 starting at 2022-03-01 and ending at 2022-07-31 as a result of their most recent budget proposal. In order to retain access to the first month\u2019s funds during the stream update, we transferred 82,417 DAI to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at 0xf737C76D2B358619f7ef696cf3F94548fEcec379. The transfer amount of 82,417 DAI is equivalent to one month of funding under their most recent budget proposal and was made by claiming the funds from the canceled stream plus a transfer of the difference between 82,417 DAI and the amount claimed. In order to retain access to the first month\u2019s funds during the stream update, we transferred 42,917 DAI to the StarkNet Engineering Core Unit at 0x6D348f18c88D45243705D4fdEeB6538c6a9191F1. The transfer amount of 42,917 DAI is equivalent to one month of funding under their most recent budget proposal and was made by claiming the funds from the canceled stream plus a transfer of the difference between 42,917 DAI and the amount claimed.

Active Signal Requests Advance \u201cRapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties\u201d to on-chain poll Signal Ends February 11th @psychonaut submits a signal request asking the community whether we should push MIP4c3-SP1: Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) towards an on-chain poll. gbMKR, a proposal to benefit long-term MKR holders Signal Request Ends February 8th In response to feedback to their recent proposal, @paraficapital adds a few improvements and initiates a signal request to the community asking whether MakerDAO should implement gbMKR. [Signal Request] Raise Gemini Dollar (GUSD) PSM Debt Ceiling To 60 Million DAI  Signal Request Ends February 8th The newly onboarded PSM-GUSD has a debt ceiling of 10m DAI and is currently close to capacity. In order to increase the diversification of stablecoin reserves, GFX Labs wants to raise the debt ceiling to 60 million DAI, which would represent approximately 32% of the outstanding GUSD float; this is in line with what could be covered by the Stability Buffer in a worst-case scenario. In an effort to push this proposal, GFXlabs asks the community where the PSM-GUSD debt ceiling should be raised to 60 million DAI, MakerMan Retroactive Delegate Comp Signal Request Ends February 18th The Recognised Delegate Compensation Trial Performance Modifier poll passed, which led to compensation calculation changes for December. However, one delegate, @MakerMan, received no compensation for November and would have received 8,245 DAI if the new compensation model had been in place. In response to this event, @prose11 submits a signal request asking the community whether the protocol should pay MakerMan the 8,245 DAI for his Recognized Delegate duties in November, calculated based on the December formula change.

Whether you hold MKR or DAI, own a vault, or want to get more involved in governance, this is your one-stop shop for MakerDAO updates.  The public PDF version is available here.   Current Events  This Week in Governance  Community Deep Dai-ve  Mark your Calendar  Useful Links  Have Feedback?   Current Events  What Core Units does the DAO need next?  The Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling Core Unit Team published a post outlining the redesigned Core Unit Incubation Program. This latest iteration, aimed at improving throughput and effectiveness, begins in Q2. The team has put together a comprehensive list of ideas for new Core Units to be assembled and onboarded:  Transparency Reporting Support Core Unit Software Quality Assurance Core Unit Accounting Support Core Unit Red Team Core Unit MIPs Review Services Core Unit Smart Contracts Auditing Core Unit Management Support Core Unit DAO Resiliency Auditing Core Unit MarComms Core Unit Events Core Unit Community Development Core Unit Makernaut Support Core Unit Developer Relations Core Unit End-User Dai Adoption Core Unit Integrations Support Core Unit Advocacy & Public Policy Core Unit Regulatory Advisory Core Unit Self Insurance Core Unit Legal Network Coordination Core Unit Core Unit Incorporation Support Legal Review Core Unit Special Purpose Core Unit(s)  While the full public announcement about the redesigned Incubation Program is still a couple of weeks away, the post gives a preview of a few of the main themes:    What Core Units does the DAO need next?    The tentative timeline we are targeting has the start of the program in the second half of April, with graduations in November, i.e., in the last governance cycle of 2022. The program will feature three separate tracks: Outreach, Legal Resiliency, and Transparency & Quality Control - three focused curricula for the facilitator candidate to choose from, critical to the development and sustainable scaling of MakerDAO. Contrary to last year\u2019s approach of full coaching teams, this program\u2019s season will focus on training the facilitator candidates. Focusing attention on the facilitator candidates aims to increase the number of Core Units added to the DAO over the year while providing the best onboarding experience that empowers the participants to successfully lead their teams.    The list of potential new CUs and the redesigned Incubation Program are not final and are currently under heavy discussion.  Real World Asset Fast-Tracking In response to ongoing inquiries and feedback by community members and Real World Asset (RWA) originators, GovAlpha submitted a signal poll asking whether MakerDAO should \u201cfast track\u201d the current RWA process. Onboarding RWAs is already a tedious and risky task that requires diligence and patience to execute efficiently and successfully. Since RWAs are also used as collateral, they introduce monetary risk. This risk is carefully analyzed and serviced with the help of several Core Units, who were upset at the idea of even submitting a public poll to support the action to fast-track RWAs. March 3rd\u2019s Governance and Risk Call discussed several issues concerning this signal request:  Lack of communication between Core Units Lack of patience by the community and RWA originators Lack of seriousness to risk mitigation   1720\u00d7960 188 KB  The majority of the community voted NO and believe that fast-tracking RWAs is a recipe for disaster.  The several responders include Nadia from Growth, who states, \u201cHow can we Fast-Track a process that\u2019s so new for everyone, from a legal and technical perspective?\u201d William from RWF also responds: \u201cThis \u201cfast-track\u201d approach is deeply disturbing. At this stage of the evolution of RWAs, enabling full self-dealing by borrowers in a pure DeFi way without any lender side oversight or due diligence with a wide variety of possible collateral and structure type considerations is not about giving Delegates and MKR token holders an option. It\u2019s about architecting a roadmap for catastrophic borrower behavior with many implications for credit risk at the core of the protocol, i.e., DAI and MKR.\u201d Eumenes, also from RWF, believes that \u201cIt appears that the Borrowers (originators) want to design a less rigorous Loan review process so that they are more likely get a Loan from Maker, and likely at more favorable terms. This would probably increase the risks in RWA asset portfolio significantly.\u201d  Although this has initiated an impassioned discussion about the subject, it has also publicly clarified that MakerDAO will not be fast-tracking RWAs anytime soon.

Active Signal Requests Real World Asset Fast-Tracking The GovAlpha core unit has posted a signal request aiming to:  Clarify Real World Asset (RWA) issuers\u2019 options for getting onboarded into Maker. Gather feedback on a \u201cfast-track process\u201d idea to ease friction for existing RWA issuers that have worked with Maker in the past.  There are currently two main ways RWA issuers can propose being onboarded:  Work with the Real World Finance Core Unit using the weekly governance cycle. Propose a new MIP.  The GovAlpha team strongly recommends the first option. Regarding a fast-track process for existing issuers, @LongForWisdom points out that exiting issuers have noted a delay between proposing the onboarding of a new RWA and concrete decision-making about that proposal. The goal of the fast-track process is to minimize this delay. Pros and cons include: Pro: This shows that Maker can be flexible and sensitive to issues facing RWA issuers/arrangers that wish to work with MakerDAO. Pro: Could allow MakerDAO to onboard RWA faster, leading to more DAI minted and increased revenues. Con: Requires Maker Governance to decide whether proposed collateral is safe and benefits Maker without evaluation from core units. Con: May expose Maker to additional risk due to imperfect legal frameworks. Con: Undermines the mandate of the Real World Finance Core Unit. Con: Bypasses the monthly governance process.

Community Deep Dai-ve  Tweet of the Week     twitter.com    Maker @MakerDAO  It's time to introduce you to the decentralized workforce of Maker \u2501 The Core Units.  Fully run by the DAO, the Core Units are decentralized groups that execute every necessary task within MakerDAO's goals.  This is how a next-generation decentralized workforce works.  \ud83d\udc47  1/   3:00 PM - 1 Mar 2022           280                52             Forum Insight Ukraine Vault/Loan/\u201dWar Bond\u201d Purchase Proposal  @Allan_Pedersen has submitted an informal poll proposing that Maker lend 1-5M DAI to Ukraine to aid their ongoing war effort. If the community supports the idea, Oasis Pro Markets and Monetalis have pledged to help execute it using real-world collateral.    Ukraine Vault/Loan/\"War Bond\" Purchase Proposal   I cannot, exactly, at this hour, tell you what will be the specific means of execution, but I will strive for getting to a situation where, as real-world collateral, we will have a loan obligation from the Nation of Ukraine (preferably a recognized bond) held by a Monetalis-Maker BVI Trust (or similar) structure and then a vault, set up specifically for this situation, and an immediate DAI minting (and probable exchange to USD) and payment.   At the close of the informal poll, 61% of the 92 forum users who voted supported the idea\u201481% of the 63 users voted for an amount selected 5M Dai.

Overall I am a big fan or what is being proposed as to the legal resiliency track. I am really excited about the Legal Network Coordination Core Unit - LNW-001 and Self Insurance Core Unit - SIN-001. I am looking to help build those two up, assuming they become actual Core Units of course. The Legal Network Coordination could, amongst other things, make sure all outside counsel is vetted appropriately and that cost efficiency is routinely being considered as a matter of course. There is a demand for this now and should be presently utilized in some fashion when considering the retention of outside counsel (imo). This space is continuously changing and we need to be as ready as we possibly can to adapt and pivot at a moments notice. I often say that it is much better to be proactive, as opposed to reactive. @SES-Core-Unit and others have put in a whole lot of time here and it is evident. ",

But, communicating and bouncing ideas off of each other is a great way to stay prepared. There is power in community. As to the legal coordination we can establish billing guidelines for outside counsel similar (but also very different) to what insurance carriers have for their panel counsel. This way we can try and track costs and limit unnecessary (and possibly inappropriate) attorney fees. This is also beneficial as to a captive insurance policy, or somewhere where Maker might be subject to a deductible, or Self Insured Retention (SIR), as the billing guidelines will hopefully limit costs.  If the bills do not comply with the guidelines they are disputed and possibly not paid. By the way, this is not legal advice of course, just spitballing ideas. ",
