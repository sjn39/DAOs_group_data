                    "content": "The community expressed interest to expand our products with Lido\u2019s stETH in the informal poll in order to increase competitiveness and market share of stETH collateralized debt, where community signaled positive for both the lower LR, higher SF wstETH-B and the higher LR, lower SF wstETH-C vault type. After assessing the state of stETH collateralized positions in Maker and Aave, Risk CU suggested support for wstETH-C and recommended to not proceed with lower LR vault type. The following work is the outcome of the aforementioned process. wstETH is already an onboarded asset, which means that we require much less resources to offer a new vault type and the governance process is lighter. We are referring to the original Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation for the assessment of the collateral asset itself, and proposing new parameters for the wstETH-C. Proposed Risk Parameters Stability Fee: 0.75% Liquidation Ratio: 185% Debt Ceiling: 150m DC-IAM gap: 15m DC-IAM ttl: 8h Cut: 0.99 Step: 90 seconds Buf: 1.2 Cusp: 0.4 Tail: 140 minutes Chip: 0.1% Tip: 300 DAI Ilk.chop: 13% Tolerance: 0.5 Ilk.hole: 10m DAI Dust: 5,000 DAI We want to maintain the same spread in LR between the A, C vault variations within the same collateral asset, which is currently 25% and sets the wstETH-C at 185%. The stability fee of 0.75% more than compensates the estimated risk premium (which is very low due to the highly liquid stETH-ETH market) and sets the product as highly competitive compared to Aave\u2019s stETH-stablecoin positions. Potentially the SF can be further lowered, but we think the initial 0.75% is low enough. The DC-IAM line (debt ceiling) can also be increased further, but there is no reason to start much higher than needed before we actually see some minting. The liquidation parameters are proportional to other similar assets like ETH and WBTC. Assuming that the community agrees with proposed parameters for wstETH-C, we would like to proceed with it to the on-chain poll next Monday, April 25th. ",
