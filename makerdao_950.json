BeInCrypto \u2013 5 Apr 22    Singapore passes law tightening rules for crypto businesses Singapore has given the green light to a new law that provides stricter oversight of cryptocurrency providers,\u00a0reports\u00a0confirmed.  Est. reading time: 1 minute       According to the various articles online:   Singapore\u2019s crypto entities are not currently regulated for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and thus the move is aimed at tightening rules for cryptocurrency providers.   People have been opining that Singapore is walking a tightrope by welcoming Web 3 companies while issuing guidelines to limit crypto advertising.   The new bill includes the imposition of a higher maximum penalty on financial institutions if they experience cyberattacks or their services are disrupted.   The bill gives greater discretion to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to preclude those who are deemed unfit from performing important activities and functions in the financial industry. These apparently will now include individuals providing payment services and conducting risk management.   ",
