It seems like an anti-thesis to the mission and ethos of Ethereum \u2026 Discord is closed source software, they discourage anonymous usage (request phone number, ban VoIP numbers, ban people who use Tor, ban certain burner emails, \u2026), they discourage development of alternative open source clients (it\u2019s against their ToS and there have been many instances of Discord bricking alt-clients and banning their users), etc. It seems like the exact opposite of what an \u201copen, permissionless Internet Money / world computer community\u201d would want to use. Yet even the technical conversations take place on Discord and people in the community are virtually expected to have a Discord account if they want to participate in daily matters. Interestingly, certain other cryptoasset communities (e.g., Bitcoin / Lightning Network, Monero, \u2026) avoid Discord and have chosen open/free alternatives (e.g., Matrix, Telegram, or even IRC). So, how come people here don\u2019t drop Discord for something more \u201cfree\u201d? How could it even get so big in the first place?

I personally think Discord has a terrible UX, but that\u2019s beyond the point here.  The entire daily operations of the Solidity team are on Matrix (our public and team channels) and we are very happy with it. Criticism I heard quite frequently was around missing server and moderation features in Matrix. I think Element is catching up on that with the \u201cspaces\u201d features now. Would really love to see more people moving away from closed source tools like this while good alternatives are available! ",

With that, \u201cexit velocity\u201d would not be needed as much as the experience of moving away would not be as atomic or abrupt, instead, it could be gradual and seamless, as people both on discord and matrix could stay in touch. That said, I\u2019d still recommend Matrix the most out of those three examples provided, Telegram does not have good tools to manage large communities (with many different discussion rooms), and is only questionably open source at best. I could illustrate an argument against IRC via a blogpost which someone over at mozilla/gnome wrote about it years ago, but i can\u2019t find it right now (found it, look below), so i\u2019ll give my personal one as well; I think IRC has run its course quite clearly, while it\u2019s a pretty robust protocol, it cant attract people today, and thus it cant be or become a backbone of communication, while more and more people pick either discord, whatsapp, or other commercial solutions for their central communication. Comparatively, matrix could be a clear upgrade from IRC, both in terms of security, and usability.

When recommending users to join Discord, I can virtually assume that they already have it installed and just need to click the button. I\u2019m much aware of the benefits of using e.g. Matrix or IRC, but those do exactly not have these qualities. They\u2019re terrible to onboard new users and I\u2019d just guess that my conversion rates would converge to zero. I doubt that I have to show data of a survey about the install rate of Matrix clients of my users. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s very low compared to Discord. I also find the \u201cwhy does Ethereum community use Discord\u201d argument a bit unfitting or hypocritical. E.g. as a member of the Ethereum community, I don\u2019t use Twitter which, in terms of closed-source-ness is exactly as terrible as Discord. So if we\u2019re having a discourse about Discord, we should also have one about not using Twitter anymore, or Medium, Github, or Substack etc. In any case, I\u2019d switch to a fairer distributed software in no time, if it meant that I can sustain the growth of my community. But as long as I can\u2019t, I\u2019m willing to make the compromise and use Discord. Edit: I forgot to say that e.g. we also bridge our Discord to Matrix. But since the bridge is lacking features, if you\u2019re a Matrix user of our project that you\u2019re like a second-class user sadly\u2026 ",
