This will make it very very hard for unscrupulous raiders and heartless manipulators to try to sway opinion on here and simply flag everything that goes against their interests, even if it doesnt involve a post violating a rule. Theres not really a point to having a forum if its 50% raid posts and manipulation. Hopefully now we can have clear and reasoned discussion on how we want to collectively govern. Cheers ",
