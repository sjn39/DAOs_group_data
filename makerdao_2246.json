I think they are a great start and fully support ratifying them on April 27th! Centrifuge is looking forward to using them with our assets that we can bring to the ecosystem. But there I have to say there are also a few things I\u2019m wondering about. As ratifying this gives the Maker community a first process to follow, I think it would be great to have an informal discussion round on the MIPs going through them, coming up with clarifying questions and maybe create some ideas for improvements or sub-proposals. Is anyone interested in joining a Zoom meeting next week to study them together and discuss them? What things can we talk about:  How would a practical implementation of the process look like? What is not clear in the MIPs? What sup-proposals should be added? Who\u2019s interested in taking part of the process in the community?  The call is happening Wednesday at 10:30am PST/17:30 UTC the 22nd of April. Zoom Meeting: https://zoom.us/j/99780944477 ",

In the original document Collateral Onboarding Process (v1) this is intentionally left to the domain teams to decide. The community signals their preferences via Community Greenlight, the domain teams signal their opinion on what is workable and then they work on whatever they want to. Because the community eventually needs to ratify the collateral types the domain teams propose, it is expected that the domain teams will largely follow community preference, however the loose brief allows them room to prioritise assets that they are well-versed in or believe strongly in. On a more human note, you get the best work out of people when they have agency. This setup gives the domain teams agency but also provides them with direction. The setup may change when domain teams are directly paid by the protocol, but for now it seemed like a good way to work. I fully admit that all of the above is not made clear in the current MIP-Set though. ",

We\u2019ve uploaded a recording of the call on youtube as well. The call started off with a discussion around the governance cadence and how these new MIPs will fit into the weekly cycle that governance has. @rune shared details on the schedule proposal: The plan is to have these run in parallel as they have mostly separate concerns (weekly GnR call is to tune system parameters, the MIP6-12 processes is for onboarding collateral). As they are being ratified and become active on May 4th, there will be additional on chain governance polls for MIP8 and MIP12 that will fit into the schedule. Come to think of it, laying out what this looks like on a calendar would be great (I might try to do that this weekend). MIPs are still in request for comments, there have been changes to some of them. @charlesstlouis  is saying: \u201cWe made changes to improve clarity, readability; e.g. MIP0, MIP8. We will update changes in the forum threads but hasn\u2019t gotten to all of them yet; Most updated version on GitHub, but we will change organization on the forums a bit.\u201d On MIP7 there was a change to add the active domain teams and who the people on them are. Timeline for ratification:  27th timing vote: Proceed with MIPs or delay Governance Ratification Voting Period May 1st - May 4th 1st Governance Cycle with begin on May 4th  The goal for mid May should be to have a number of MIP6 proposals published both in the Maker forum and on Github. In an ideal scenario, these proposals cover all major tokens available on SET protocol and Uniswap. Also, applications for real-world assets would be great to add as a signal to startups and other companies that now there is a formalized governance process in place and that there will be a direct response to their application (as opposed to how it took place in the past). To keep things going, people expressed interest in doing another one of these calls perhaps even on a regular cadence to organize around collateral onboarding. It is important to note that this call should not be any sort of gatekeeper and that the MIPs process via posting on the forum will be the way to submit these proposals. Topics to discuss on the call are more around coordination, collaboration of editing the MIPs/discussing process improvements and sharing learnings. I will tentatively put the first of this call on Wednesday the 13th of May at 10:30am PST/17:30 UTC, one week into the ratification of the process and will post on the forums coming up to the date with an invite and a zoom link. Please point out any omissions/corrections to this summary and I\u2019ll adjust it. Call Recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=336RkUuI6hA ",

I\u2019m going to be following up with a summary on the call that will probably turn into a new forum thread discussing collateral governance and risk for illiquid assets. ",
