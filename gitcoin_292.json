As the USD price of GTC fluctuates, it creates a reinforcing concern of increasing sell pressure (more tokens need to be sold to meet the same USD equivalent) and accelerating the depletion of our treasury.  How might we address these concerns If workstream budgets were awarded in both GTC and a stable coin, this helps to reduce the burdens described above. Knowing that the amount of stablecoins in the treasury is finite, I would propose the following approach to issuing stable coins as part of our budgeting process:   Under any circumstance, a workstream may request up to 15% of their workstream budget in stable coins   A GTC/USD rate, falling below a price, would allow for the percentage to increase. Here is a table for discussion:       GTC USD equivalent Percent of Stables allowed to request     Any price 15%   Below $1.75 25%   Below $1.50 35%   Below $1.25 45%   Below $1 65%   Below $.75 85%     There needs to be sufficient stables in the treasury to accomplish this, and gathering such stables should not further jeopardize the GTC/USD rate   Implications of this approach If we took this approach in S15, we could have seen $450K in stables removed from the treasury, and $2.5MM in GTC removed as part of our budgeting effort (assuming each workstream requested their allowed amount of stables). With only $3MM of stable coins in the treasury, this amount will last for 6 seasons. With the treasury diversification we will have access to more stables, but the timing and amount is still not clear.  What do you all think? is this reasonable? ",

As the USD price of GTC fluctuates, it creates a reinforcing concern of increasing sell pressure (more tokens need to be sold to meet the same USD equivalent) and accelerating the depletion of our treasury.   Amazing articulation of a local minima of instability and insecurity that Gitcoin is in!  Solutioning     kyle:  How might we address these concerns If workstream budgets were awarded in both GTC and a stable coin, this helps to reduce the burdens described above. Knowing that the amount of stablecoins in the treasury is finite, I would propose the following approach to issuing stable coins as part of our budgeting process:   Under any circumstance, a workstream may request up to 15% of their workstream budget in stable coins   A GTC/USD rate, falling below a price, would allow for the percentage to increase. Here is a table for discussion:  (table-removed-to-save-space)   There needs to be sufficient stables in the treasury to accomplish this, and gathering such stables should not further jeopardize the GTC/USD rate      This proposal just tapes over a couple major issues.   Tape Over Cracks I think you articulate one of the cracks in the proposal really well.     kyle:  There needs to be sufficient stables in the treasury to accomplish this, and gathering such stables should not further jeopardize the GTC/USD rate   This is a hard problem because \u201chow do you raise $1million/month to continue operations when the primary asset on your balance sheet is going down?\u201d is a hard problem. It\u2019s especially hard when you havent created an escape velocity in momentum towards solving the hard problem (or worse, you haven\u2019t even reached consensus about how you\u2019re going to solve the hard problem yet so the creation of new velocity through action is blocked). The biggest crack you are taping over in this proposal is that if you are in the situation in which you need to use the policy, GTCUSD is going down.  If GTCUSD is going down it reflects an accelerating lack of confidence that GTC is a good asset to hold. Yes, it would be good to create a pocket of psychological safety for the team to have salary in stables.  But it\u2019s a mirage because it\u2019s only temporary.  What happens when that pocket of psychological safety runs out of oxygen? Yes, the DAO\u2019s dumping of $1m/mo on market is SOME source of downward pressure.  But anyone who has read the bull case for GTC knows there will be other sources of downward pressure too.  Some of them are within the DAO\u2019s control and some won\u2019t. So that brings me to my final point - What will the DAO do in this situation?  Will DAO members have the hard conversations with each other?  Will they rally around each other? Will the DAO cut budgets?  Will it reorganize?  Will it somehow become more effective at realize the bull case for GTC?   Will it leanly find sources of downward pressure on GTC and relieve them? or will Gitcoin continue to just wander around in the abyss of being a pre-product market fit and pre-revenue startup with a $12 million/year burn & dwindling treasury and let the downward spiral of lack of confidence continue to accelerate until GTCUSD is over the brink? or something else?  I think the DAO should get serious about reverse engineering an upward spiral from the downward spiral. But it\u2019s not up to me. The narrative that Gitcoin collectively pursues is the narrative that it will manfiest.  (Gitcoin = multistakeholder system of token holders, protocols, GTC HODLers, GTC builders, DAO citizens, the ecosystem, Vitalik)     kyle:  What do you all think? is this reasonable?   I\u2019m on the opposite side of the downward pressure in the market of ideas. I\u2019m a knife catcher     I now hold GTC bags.  As someone who\u2019s been holding GTC bags, I think this proposal is a good start but I do not support it and encourage the DAO to vote against it. But if it paired with another small proposal (or set of proposals) that answers the above concerns, I would support it. I think Gitcoin\u2019s got good bones but in all sincerity it\u2019s a distressed asset.  A lifetime ago, before I got into investing in DAOs, I used to work real estate and got into flipping houses.  Gitcoin reminds me of a house with good bones in a neighborhood that\u2019ll maybe get hot in a few years, but it needs some repairs/TLC. Good luck. ",

I\u2019m answering this question here publicly so I don\u2019t have to repeat it\u2026  Hey isn\u2019t GTC up 20% in the last month?  I dont think it\u2019s in a downward spiral The first half is a great factual observation, but I dont think the 2nd assertion is true.  GTC/USD is up 20% in the last 30 days  gtcusd30d1136\u00d7932 78.6 KB   But GTC/ETH is flat or trending downwards (last 30 days)  gtceth30d1784\u00d71064 117 KB   And GTC/ETH is flat or trending downwards (last 1 year)  gtceth90d1764\u00d71070 105 KB   What conclusions can we draw from this data? GTC/USD is a very low liquidity market in between ETH/USD and GTC/ETH. The upward price on GTC/USD is due to ETH/USD recovering. The flat/downward price on GTC/ETH is a sign that people who are more deeply involved in the Ethereum Ecosystem (ppl who hold ETH - like most of Gitcoin\u2019s contributors, token holders, stewards) do not think that GTC is a better hold than ETH or other ETH-based assets.     a33titude:  I think the DAO should get serious about reverse engineering an upward spiral from the downward spiral.   TLDR I think a medium/long term reversal on GTC/ETH is a sign of this upward spiral. ",
