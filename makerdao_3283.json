If there is something that I can not complaint regarding the Foundation is about certainty on monthly payments and job security, which is very important for someone that carries a family. I know that working for a DAO will bring some more uncertainties which I believe I\u2019m up to take but wanna see up to which point they will be.  Currently we are increasing the Surplus Buffer, which is a first step towards \u201ccertainty about payments\u201d. Problem: However the SB can be used for many things, MKR-holders can change their minds every few months about its usage and, perhaps most importantly, it is expressed in DAI. Obviously DAIs are correlated to MakerDAO\u2019s performance and in principle could lose the peg. People working want to work, not to lose sleep thinking that the crypto market could crash, that the reserves could be depleted, etc! PROPOSAL: what do you think about starting a reserve of uncorrelated assets (e.g., USDC) intended to be exclusively used to guarantee security of payments to people working for (Core Units of) MakerDAO? Ideally for a decent time-frame lile 24 months. GOAL: We want to make MakerDAO the best place for talents in the crypto\u2013space to come and work. Good salaries, exciting jobs. And this also included job security. Of course job security does not mean that you can sleep, do nothing, and still get your salary. It only means that if you do well your job, and your Core Unit facilitator is happy about it, you can sleep well knowing that MakerDAO has reserves of money (uncorrelated to its potential failure) to pay your salary.

Extremely small caveat: we are all in a risky environment and I think everyone is aware of that. Fundamentally we can\u2019t yet provide the job security a public institution can promise \u2013 that\u2019s OK. We\u2019re a lot more interesting. So I think we should commit to extremely good faith efforts towards job stability and very satisfying compensation levels but also stay honest about the risks. ",

In principle I agree, but if you have a family you might want more security than just \u201cgood faith\u201d towards MKR holders. Anyway, this is just a discussion to see what is the sentiment about this. I personally have a very stable job, basically risk free.

People are not employed by the DAO so there are obviously some risks (but Core Units can employ people and provide some insurance).
