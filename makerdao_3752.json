Or do you have to be actively maintaining the network with MKR to see the benifits of the token? For example, I really like this project but I do not feel qualified to actively participate with the direction that the project takes. Is it safe and reasonable for me to own MKR in this senario? Edit 1: As a disclaimer, I have been studying this project for 5 months now. I wouldnt say I am ignorant to the goals of the project, but I am still learning. speed test ",

This does not guarantee appreciation of MKR on the secondary market. And direct participation is indeed optional. ",

Everyone on this forum or on RocketChat is willing to answer questions (I\u2019ve asked plenty of really basic ones myself) and if you hang around here often enough, you\u2019ll soon form opinions on the directions we are taking. Most signal request discussions also point out the issues involved and you can form an opinion on their arguments. I want to stress that the more people we have contributing with ideas or pointing out issues with our current direction, the more successful the protocol gets. So please don\u2019t feel shy to make your voice heard. The fact that you own MKR tokens means you are as invested in Maker\u2019s success as anyone else! ",
