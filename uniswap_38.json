I think it is important to remember that the Uniswap team is made up of 11 people. Imagine for a moment, the volume of work of planning, development, testing, etc., to achieve in less than six months:  V3 running Outperform sites like Coinbase in daily transactions. Undisputed leader defi Token UNI among the top 10 on the market  All my support and appreciation for this great team. I will continue trying to talk more and more about what I consider our project. A grain of sand does not do much, but if we all pitch in, the grain can become a beach \u2026 Greetings ",

To comrade Allo, simply remind him that a new vote has been approved, which is a \u201cmodification of the project\u2019s roadmap.\u201d Everyone can give their opinion if this option is good or not, but they allow us to give their opinion and vote. In my opinion it is a slight modification that improves the initial approach and will achieve objectives that we have not yet imagined. What is evident is that we have a way to go and this will be marked by the initial roadmap and the proposals and votes of the members of the Community. For my part, proud to belong to this group and excited about what is to come. I only miss, not having more knowledge to make it available to the Community. A hug for all those who feel this great project is theirs. ",
