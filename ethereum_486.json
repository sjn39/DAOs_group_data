As far I could understand, the is an opinion, we need some kind of organization in order to accept donations given to Ethereum Magicians. I am a big supporter of an idea of personal membership and would avoid any formal organization so much as possible. Money and payments will make the organization even more problematic in my eyes. So I would make a proposal how to accept donations without becoming an organization at all. If would introduce magicians token (MEM - Magic Ethereum Mana?   ), which should be publicly tradeable. The token could be minted for people for their activities inside FEM. Donators targeting the community as whole should not pay to FEM directly, they should buy and burn some amount of tokens and present an proof-of-burn. FEM can publicly maintain of the list of the biggest burners (sponsors). Buy and Burn actions will create a price for the token. May be, we could introduce sub-tokens for particular Rings for the case if the sponsor would like to support particular Ring (f.e. MEM.Wallet). In this case a he could buy and burn a mix of MEM token and MEM.Wallet token in some proportion. This is a rough idea. Many aspects have to be defined yet. Nevertheless it solves the main problem: we don\u2019t need a organization to accept donations. @boris, I hope the idea could be valuable for your talk tomorrow. ",

There is a problem we identified where sending an invoice and receiving fiat on behalf of FEM or a ring (shared by myself and @fubuloubu) AND dealing with the associated taxes. This is (partially) solved with Host Organizations. The other problem is governance of the funds. I\u2019ll write more in the follow up notes. ",
