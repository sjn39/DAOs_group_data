Inspired by Goerli and with Constantinople and Istanbul activated, Lisinski is a PoA Clique chain focused on Croatia (all validators are from here) because we want to grow and support the local ecosystem of eth devs with a good playground and hackathon support. In spite of this, we\u2019ve opened the testnet globally along with a faucet, rudimentary explorer and more, so you can just as well join in via RPC or even power up a node of your own and start hacking. It works perfectly fine on something as weak as a raspberry pi while the chain is this small, so please join us and break things. We also support whisper, and will soon open up IPFS and Swarm nodes. More information on why, how, etc. available at https://lisinski.online/en and you can come chat to us via Gitter and on our forum. ",

Note that while validators are from Croatia and all our servers are (or will be) in Croatia (we don\u2019t like cloud hosting and think it should be effectively blacklisted in the context of public blockchains), the testnet is intended to be used by all - we want \u201coutsiders\u201d because we want a rich ecosystem of smart contracts that can interact with each other, we want to test latency, etc. etc. All our documentation (forum posts, tutorials, website, etc.) will be bi-lingual, so there\u2019s always going to be an English language version of everything, for practicality\u2019s sake. Next week we\u2019re also launching an IBFT2.0 testnet, driven by Pantheon (the recently released Java client), so we can experiment with larger numbers of validators (20+ hopefully). Lots of developments pending, so be sure to follow along! ",
