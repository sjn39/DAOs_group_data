                    "content": "We define entangled tokens to A and B to the tokens that share a same wallet, so that any transaction with the wallet could be operated by any of them. The functionality is similar to the entanglement of two particles but with tokens, in the sense that whatever changes the state of A it affects B. We advocate the entangled tokens have key utility for the value preservation (vreservation) of digital assets, though other further applications can be devised. In the case of value preservation, its importance arises since we\u2019ll see a massive migration of value (in the history of mankind) onto the Blockchain along with a new identity forged on blockchain for this value. This value needs to be preserved. So we see how value migrates (1), tokenises (2) and preserves (3) the value of digital assets as NFT as a means of a totally new identity and wealth management for a private and safe assets scrow for all, and redefining the today\u2019s role of consumers towards a more co-creation and co-ownership of locals. An use case is to keep contact between an artist and an buyer of its NFTs. If an artist T has created a digital piece of art P with an NFT with wallet, then T creates 2 entangled tokens A and B so that he keeps A and transfer B to the wallet of P. By construction of entangled tokens, only one transfer is possible for them, thus the artist proofs he\u2019s been the creator of P by sending a transaction to A that is visible from B. Otherwise, the owner of P might check the authenticity of the artist by sending a transaction to B so that the artist might proof by showing the outcome out of A. ",

The proposal advocates for the use of entangled tokens for value preservation of digital assets, with NFTs as a means of a new identity and wealth management. The post also provides a use case for entangled tokens in the art industry. The post does not receive entirely positive or negative feedback, but rather constructive criticism and questions from third parties. The author is also advertising the proposal.",

Would it make more sense to define a function that allows arbitrary calls as the wallet (just forwards the calldata) instead of explicitly specifying tokenTransfer? Is it necessary to create a standard around this, as opposed to just building a smart contract wallet with this functionality? Seems like EIP-721 covers the marketplace functionality, and any wallet functions will need a UI hosted somewhere anyway. Gnosis Safe is a great example of a smart contract wallet (though it doesn\u2019t use NFTs.)  ",

Otherwise, the owner of P might check the authenticity of the artist by sending a transaction to B so that the artist might proof by showing the outcome out of A   If this is the desired interaction, what you want I\u2019m not sure is \u201ctokens\u201d but a separation of the roles of \u201ccreator\u201d and \u201cowner\u201d? The ERC721 standard has an ownerOf inquiry function that tracks who owns a given token (which covers who currently purchased and owns the artwork). Often the collection overall has an \u201cowner\u201d that is the creator/manager of the collection overall, which in your scenario would be the artist that made the tokens. Inquiring who is the current owner of a given token, or who is the creator of a whole collection are also usually \u201cview\u201d functions, meaning the user doing the inquiry doesn\u2019t need an on-chain transaction to get that data, it can be done with a free call to any Ethereum node. If it\u2019s needed for a human to be able to prove they are indeed \u201cthe artist\u201d of the collection, they could sign a message from the address that is currently the owner of the collection, proving they are in control of the private key of that address at that moment. If you\u2019re envisioning a need for different artists/creators within one ERC721 token, the discussion over here about different roles  added to a token standard, might be an option of a way to implement this, without it needing to be a completely separate standard? Is there another use-case you\u2019re thinking of where \u201centangled tokens\u201d would be a useful way to track things? ",
