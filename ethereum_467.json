                    "content": "Motivation: Representing the big system integrator and delivering a number of Blockchain projects to enterprise clients I regularly have a need to discuss and/or validate the solution architecture of my projects with someone experienced, someone who has different or broader view on the underlying (Ethereum) technology, its components or its future. I often need to check technology assumptions, discuss software architecture patterns and integration possibilities with someone who is proven to be an expert (and better with the group of experts). Also the presence of quality materials explaining the typical architecture choices, common patterns and guiding through a number of architecture decisions should simplify and speed up the solution delivery, increase its quality and standardization. I see the mission of the Ring of Ethereum Architects (REA) in guiding the underlying architectures for Ethereum based solutions. At the moment I can see three aspects to this mission:  to document and build consensus around principles of Ethereum reference architecture and to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary; to guide through solution design challenges involving general Ethereum architecture brought to the REA and provide a library of relevant design patterns; to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside Ethereum. To keep a list of the recognized Ethereum architects  No set of documents will ever answer all the hard questions, so interpretation and subsequent refinement of the Ethereum reference architecture will certainly be necessary. The REA will not just document what is widely accepted; it will also anticipate growth and fundamental interoperability problems. Elaborating the intended direction of the Ethereum reference architecture will help resolve issues when setting future directions, help establish criteria for starting new work, and help community coordinate its work with that of other organizations. As a start of ring work I propose the initial REA meeting plan as follows:  The REA will hold a regularly scheduled distributed meeting (at least every month). The REA will organize occasional face-to-face meetings (I can provide the office space in the Netherlands or Germany). The REA may organize workshops to explore particular architectural issues.  Looking forward to the opinions, critics, support and also to see faces of people with similar needs in Prague. ",

I would not see it so restrictive. The \u201creal EA\u2019s work\u201d is not inside the Ethereum community only. They also act  as an interface to corporate world, because that is what corps are looking for (read the post from @apitkevich). EAs help to adopt the technology by corps and collect requirements from them. It makes sense and win-win for all. As I stated in Forming a Ring of EA post, the Architect role is aimed to be \u201cfinancially self-sufficient\u201d. Corps are ready to pay for the architect knowledge and it is how the EAs can earn some money. IMHO, it is important to give people a possibility to earn money with their skills.  The reality is you can claim to be in the REA. Anyone can. If someone is impressed with that and hires you, \u2026 Why manage a list of everyone\u2019s resumes, when everyone can just manage their own resumes?  What you are describing is an example of some bad implementation. Let us find the better one. What I have mentioned, there is a valid demand: \u0441orps will find people, and people would like to be found. Cooperation between REA and industry is important for both sides.

Now there is incentivize to be on this list. Who manages the list? Well, if it is a person or group of people, they have direct control over discovery of these architects. If it is the entire REA, then the ring is no longer permissionless as we are gatekeeping. If there is no gatekeeper, then there is no list, it is just a participation badge (which is fine!) You can get into something fancy with TCRs, but they haven\u2019t really been proven widely in practice and it\u2019s still a gatekeeper functionality at the end of the day, albeit a more incentive-aligned one. It is also a massive distraction, you are constantly worried about your position on the list as it directly affects your ability to get work. You could argue brand building is the same thing, but it makes the implicit explicit. Good architects will be \u201cfinancially self-sufficient\u201d by being good architects. Participating in the REA and sharing your knowledge on how you can be most efficient and solve problems for corp clients is a sign of being a good Ethereum architect, because it\u2019s a sign that you believe radical colloboration (not competition) gets work done faster and better. Your resume and the work you\u2019ve done in the past fills in the rest of blanks. A list either devolves meaninglessness (badges), or is a gatekeeping function that prevents others from realizing their own abilities and turns all of it into a competitive game instead of a cooperative one. I don\u2019t want to build REA as that system. You can feel free to, but I\u2019d like to keep the ring permissionless and colloborative so we can all grow, do well, and help others. ",
