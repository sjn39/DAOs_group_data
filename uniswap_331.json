At least here in Argentina (US has a different form of constitution, but every country has its own), there is two parts: 1- A dogmatic one (in the us this are the ammends) in which people talks about their rights and yada yada, thats the part if which we declare our descentralization and let the chaos embrace the beuty. 2- A organic. This is the part formed in \u201ccontracts\u201d in the constitutions, and is what could be easily replaced by smart contracts. I have already made a post on the proposal discussion about the creation of something based on the legislative power. Before this, i was working on a tecnocrat constitution as a thesis work, irl im a lawyer in Argentina but im planning on emigrating and working on it on international universities once this COVID thing normalizes a bit jajajajaja0 ",
