MIP14c4 places a cap on the total amount of DAI that can be distributed through MIP14. The number chosen, 250,000 DAI, is arbitrary and amendment requires a full Monthly Governance Cycle. Consequently, a failure state exists where the sum of all fund requests in a Governance Cycle through MIP14 will exceed the ceiling and/or it will not be possible to raise with sufficient lead-time to distribute Maker Governance approved funds in a timely manner. Rather than dealing with sequential subproposals to raise the Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling, or setting it to an arbitrarily high number that renders it useless, it makes more sense to simply remove this restriction. The remaining content of MIP14 remains appropriate, in my opinion. There is no need to replace the whole MIP.  Amended MIPs and Components   MIP14c4 is removed by this subproposal.   Amendment Pull Request  Pull Request   Relevant Information We have already received two MIP14c2 proposals that sum to 182,454 DAI:  MIP14c2-SP1 MIP14c2-SP2  ",

This subproposal amends MIP14: Protocol DAI Transfer. It specifically removes the component c4 (Protocol DAI Transfer Ceiling). Alongside MIP40: Budget Framework and MIP55: Special Purpuse Fund, MIP14 is one of the ratified mechanisms to transfer Dai out of the protocol. Out of the three, MIP14 is the most generic one and has no restrictions as to how it may be used. MIP14c4 sets a limit on how much Dai can be transferred out of the protocol cumulatively (i.e., the tally is kept across every use of MIP14). The author anticipates the MIP14 generic mechanism being put to use frequently enough during the transition towards the Endgame that the limit will become a hindrance to swift governance. If this subproposal is ratified, c4 will be removed from MIP14. This proposal has been assigned Medium-Impact based on the methodology listed here.
