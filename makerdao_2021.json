                    "content": " MIP11: Collateral Onboarding General Risk Model Management  Preamble MIP#: 11 Title: Collateral Onboarding General Risk Model Management Author(s): Cyrus Younessi (@DonutJr), Rune Christensen (@Rune23), Charles St.Louis (@CPSTL) Type: Process Status: Accepted Date Proposed: 2020-04-06 Dependencies: MIP0, MIP3, MIP7 Replaces: n/a   Summary This proposal defines the process and requirements for risk teams to onboard general risk models for use in collateral onboarding in MIP12.  Motivation Risk models are a crucial element of the Maker Protocol\u2019s maintenance and growth. The models provide a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or other part of the risk function. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to create a defined and formalized process for Risk teams to more easily onboard their models to the Maker Protocol and ultimately help grow and maintain the Protocol.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP11 Components   MIP11c1: General Risk Model Requirements  MIP11c2: List of Active General Risk Models  MIP11c3: Process for Onboarding  MIP11c4: Process for offboarding    MIP11c1: General Risk Model Requirements Description: A general model provides a representation of how a risk team intends to evaluate an asset or another part of the risk function. This can help determine which assets should be given priority as approved assets make their way into the collateral pool. A general model acts as a natural filtration mechanism where collateral types are ranked against one another for prioritization purposes. A general model must contain a quantitative risk methodology for the evaluation of risk parameters. Optionally, it can also contain:  A qualitative framework that describes the process for evaluating the fundamentals of a proposed collateral asset A scoring framework for collateral assets that enables a standardized approach for converting qualitative analysis into numerical outputs. This is achieved through a ratings-based methodology.    MIP11c2: List of Active General Risk Models Template Explanation:   Sub-proposal Number (MIP11c3-SP): #  Risk Team Name: The name of the Risk Team that submitted the General Risk Model  General Risk Model Name: The name of the General Risk Model  Date Added: <date in (yyyy-mm-dd) format>  Summary: Summary of the General Risk Model  Link to full documentation: Due to the length of General Risk Models they are contained in separate documents.  Active General Risk Models:  < list >    MIP11c3: Process for Onboarding   Outcome: The General Risk Model specified in the MIP11c3 Sub Proposal is appended to MIP11c2.

Because these are all good idea to me, but it will end up the same as before if you guys are not doing framework structure , not only in the proposed pools, docs etc but in the team itself. I have no clue who is in charge right now. ",
