                    "content": " Embedding Legal Analysis into MakerDAO Governance: Initial Steps Proposal by SES Legal Research* TL;DR  New governance proposals often lack proper legal or regulatory analysis. SES Legal Research wants to open the discussion with the community: does MakerDAO need to implement a legal review process on new governance proposals? An implementation example of a legal review process is provided  Past community discussions have revealed concerns about the legal risks and regulatory consequences of proposals made to MakerDAO, such as new Core Unit proposals, activities, or product features. Community members always provide valuable opinions in the public forum, but the lack of institutional tools to ensure educated debate regarding legal matters negatively impacts the DAO\u2019s decision-making abilities. Valid legal questions or concerns, especially when pertaining to a multi-billion dollar venture like MakerDAO, ultimately cannot be dealt with using makeshift regulatory analysis or hearsay legal opinions. SES Legal Research wants to begin a discussion over legal risks that new proposals can bring to the protocol and how to overcome the current lack of legal analysis. This forum thread aims to gauge the general sentiment around the issue and gather feedback on possible strategies.  The Need for Legally Relevant Information & Analysis Any new governance proposal may have serious legal or regulatory consequences for MakerDAO. Let\u2019s think about some of the discussions in the forum, such as raising capital or changing tokenomics ( i.e. (a16z, monetsupply, DAO singularity). Implementing a strategy that may be beneficial for MakerDAO can still imply serious legal or regulatory risks. For example, issuing new assets that may resemble debt or equity, or implementing staking rewards would require new governance proposals that could trigger a regulatory review or enforcement actions around securities laws, AML, and taxation. Exposure to private litigation risk also could occur. Today, MakerDAO does not currently have a specialized legal Core Unit or other readily available means to verify the legal consequences of implementing a new strategy or engaging in a new activity. It is also clear that a few major obstacles make it difficult for lawyers and law firms to cooperate with a DAO. Although many legal resources work on solutions to these problems, this environment will not change overnight. That said, MKR holders and their Delegates require these resources now to act in the DAO\u2019s best interest. Basic legal information, such as monitoring patents or any regulatory filings, support making educated decisions when assessing the legal risk of new proposals submitted to governance.  Current Requirements for Proponents Currently in the governance processes:  Legal information or analysis is not required or advised for adding new Core Units. Legal information or analysis is not required or advised for adding any changes to the Maker Protocol via MIPs. Onboarding new collateral types include some basic legal requirements in the process, in both general Collateral Application Template (MIP6c2) and RWA Only Supplement to Collateral Onboarding Application (MIP6c3-SP1). This recent amendment introduced some legal questions based on SES Legal Research\u2019s input.  Besides collateral onboarding, there are no procedural guarantees or requirements regarding the provision of legally relevant information or legal analysis.  Initial Steps Towards Embedding Legal Analysis into Governance Processes: implementation example What is the goal? This potential solution is not an attempt to solve the entire underlying problem of acquiring legal advice by the DAO, but rather introduces relatively low effort measures to improve the current unsustainable situation. Short term goals would be the following:  Create the basic means to acquire legally relevant information. Correct the \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d negotiation strategy MIP authors are forced into related to legal topics. Dedicate funding for basic legal analysis.  Long term goals would be the following:  Improve the quality of decision-making on new proposals by adding legal analysis. Reduce the decision-making complexity for MKR holders & delegates by synthesizing legal analysis. Reduce regulatory and legal risk without stifling innovation. Increase the quality of new proposals. Formalize and standardize a process of legal audit.  Who would be required to provide legally relevant information? MIP and CU proponents are in the best position to provide legally relevant information. This process should take place as a good faith effort and be understood as an opportunity to build a good legal case for their proposal. What is legally relevant information? Any material that provides necessary information or context around a specific proposal is relevant information that can be used to draw legal conclusions. Typical items will include the proponent\u2019s own declarations and statements, legal opinions, written explanations, information about IP, examples, and statements from public authorities, to name a few. Who could request legally relevant information? In RFC, any community member can voice their opinion or demand additional legal information. However, the legal poll described below is only available for MKR holders and their delegates. Would every proponent be required to provide any type of legally relevant information? It would not be efficient to automatically require legally relevant information from any new MIP proponent. MKR holders should have flexibility in deciding whether, when, and what kind of legally relevant information is requested from the proponent. Should MakerDAO make the provision of legally relevant information a formal requirement? Not necessarily at this stage in this original proposal. It could, however, be a requirement in further phases (see below). When could the request for legally relevant information be made? Any community member can request additional legal information during the RFC phase. After the RFC freeze, a new \u201clegal\u201d poll could be included with the question: Does this proposal require additional legally relevant information? The \u201clegal poll\u201d could run from Monday to Thursday of the first week of the monthly governance cycle, during the formal submission window, where currently no governance polls take place. If the MakerDAO community believes that a specific proposal is too risky in its current state and requires additional legal support, the proposal would enter a legal review loop. In these cases, the proponent has to provide additional legal documentation or alternatively can iterate the proposal. After that, the proponent can re-submit the proposal back to RFC or formal submission. If the legal poll \u201cpasses\u201d (i.e., it doesn\u2019t require additional legally relevant information), the proposal can continue its process in the monthly cycle and proceed with the ratification poll, which concludes the last week of the month. Show me a process for that. This is how the new process may look:  960\u00d7540 125 KB  Who should pay for the independent legal feasibility study? MakerDAO could fully or partially bear the financial burden of providing legally relevant information and analyses. The necessary assumption for MakerDAO to cover this financial burden is that the proposal is worth pursuing, and the DAO would accept it. It should be noted that thanks to covering the cost of an independent legal feasibility study, MakerDAO would not create additional financial barriers to entry for valuable proposals and participants. Who should deliver the independent legal feasibility study? Independent actors (e.g., experts or law firms) acting on behalf of the proponent. This may seem flawed as the proponent is obviously interested in obtaining a favorable feasibility study. This situation is acceptable\u2014we want to give the proponent the chance to build the best legal case for their solution. The ultimate decision to accept the proposal would still be up to MakerDAO, which eventually will have its own legal resources (i.e., legal CUs or legal MetaDAOs) to assess input information. Should the independent legal feasibility study be public? Generally yes. Exceptions can be discussed. What if the independent legal feasibility study is critical? It is often impossible to get 100% certainty or a fully conclusive legal opinion. Almost everything in the DeFi / DAO ecosystem carries some degree of legal/regulatory risk. Legal risk appetite is a question of strategy. The legal feasibility study would educate the MakerDAO community about the legal background for their decisions. What would be the desired outcomes of the proposed reform?  MKR holders and the community receive an opportunity to request and obtain legally relevant information. Discussions with legally relevant information encourage more organized legal discussion and the eventual emergence of further legal tools, analytics, and processes for MakerDAO. MKR holders and the community are able to verify the legal feasibility of proposals before accepting them, while at the same time proponents are provided with a clear procedure and timeframes. Proponents have an opportunity to iterate proposals to reduce legal risk to a level acceptable to MKR holders. The process can be slowed down for selected proposals only (those not \u201cpassing\u201d the legal poll). MIP authors have to anticipate not passing the legal poll, discouraging a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d approach. Improve the quality of new proposals. MIP authors can receive financial support to keep the barrier to entry low. Present the best legal case for the proposal.   Next steps   Discuss and gather feedback from the community.  Does MakerDAO need to implement a formal legal review loop on new governance proposals?    What should be the requirements for this process to work in MakerDAO and eventually in a MetaDAO paradigm?   Concrete feedback on the proposed model   Alternative implementation proposals   SES Legal Research is the name that the @SES-Core-Unit  uses for legal and regulatory topics and initiatives. In line with the core unit\u2019s vision of sustainably growing the Maker Protocol\u2019s moats by removing barriers between decentralized workforce, capital, and work, SES Legal Research bootstraps projects and incubates Core Units that are of legal nature. This is the second project branded by SES Legal Research (the first was the Self Insurance Fund). Expect soon more content and proposals coming from SES legal research.   ",

And, assuming there is such a privilege recognized, there will likely be a question as to how far that will extend, especially if the information is disseminated (basically waiving the privilege).

Of course that is ideal, but that will take time and these proposals need to be vetted now. Also, I think there are other reasons to outsource and not have formal legal opinions coming from community members, including possible ethical and malpractice insurance issues. I think there have to be a few \u201cgo to\u201d firms which will become educated to Maker. That way you do not have to start from the ground up when explaining what is needed. I know some of us are putting in the heavy lifting now educating counsel. Hopefully that pays off we can build on that. ",
