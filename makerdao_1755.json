This thread is intended to collect questions for the Coinbase CFO, Alesia Haas, for an upcoming live call in the coming days. We have a short time frame (30-minute call slot) for the call, and all questions will need to be screened by Coinbase\u2019s legal team for us to get a complete answer on air. For questions to be considered, they must be submitted by 17:00 UTC on Thursday, Sept. 22. I have volunteered to moderate and curate the question list for Coinbase as a neutral party and will be using this thread to collect questions. A few additional notes:  Questions covered in this session will be strictly limited to those relating to MIP81. If you have other Coinbase-related inquiries, do not expect them to be addressed during this call and I would ask for some self-reflection on that point before submitting questions here. I will be submitting as many eligible questions as possible to ensure we can have a full conversation. Please note that due to time constraints and potential volume issues, posting a relevant question here does not guarantee it will be asked live. I will do my best to group related questions and cover as much ground as possible. Hopefully this goes without saying, but we can have a spirited round of questions and debates while still respecting the proposal author. It is somewhat rare for MIP authors to host a dedicated public call, and even more rare for that call to bring in the CFO of a large institution. Our actions reflect upon our community, and regardless of your stance on this proposal, being able to have respectful discourse with authors is paramount to the DAO having willing decentralized governance participants.  Hopefully, that covers all our bases . If you are unhappy with the format or how this call goes, I would ask that you direct that frustration toward me as Coinbase has largely followed my suggestions on how to best do this. Let\u2019s put our best foot forward and seize the opportunity to have a hot-button governance proposal discussed with the source! ",

Understanding that the Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards Program Rate is a negotiated rate for all Participating Institutions and that Coinbase can change the rate at its discretion, I have a few questions regarding standard business practices:   What communication notice (e.g. 30 days notice) can we expect from Coinbase regarding rate changes on the program?   Can we expect a communication regarding the program rate after FOMC meetings in which changes (Increases/Decreases) are made to the Fed Fund Target Rate?   Can you please provide an example of the rewards rate earned on 500mm. Would all the 500mm earn 150bps APY or is it tiered (100mm earns 100bps, 10mm earns 110bps, 10mm earns 120bps, etc)?      MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards   Coinbase will pay rewards based on our USDC Institutional Rewards POC program rates:  100bps APY on first 100mm 10bps more APY on each 100mm thereafter Rewards rate will be paid based on the highest tier the client falls into Rewards are not to exceed 150bps APY     Is the USDC Institutional Rewards Program ending at the end of 2022?     MIP81: Coinbase USDC Institutional Rewards   USDC Institutional Rewards POC will be in effect until the end of 2022, and the final payment will be made on the subsequent month.   ",

The latest from Gensler in reaction to the Merge opens up a new front for our consideration!

I understand that it might be too short notice to do this, but would you consider changing the format so: You collect questions from this thread for the next ~24-48 hours. Questions are condensed by you and submitted as a supplemental DD checklist in writing. ~48-72 hours later, we get written responses back. ~24 hours later, we have a live call to discuss. I think having the benefit of an initial response to our general questions before the call can make live follow-up more engaging and informative for the community. In any event, we should all keep in mind that Coinbase has already provided several answers to community questions in it\u2019s main MIP thread, and I hope we can prioritize questions that leverage this information.

Noting that this will likely not be possible on the Coinbase end, as one of the reasons they are able to offer their CFO for this call is with the knowledge that their legal term has reviewed what the responses will be. My personal plan for the call is to submit as many of these questions as possible in hopes that pre-prepared questions can serve as a potential follow up to the answers given live. Happy to have @CB_Institutional correct me if I\u2019ve misconstrued anything, but hopefully that sheds some light on why the question asking format will be somewhat restricted during the call. I apologize if this set up is confusing for the community, basically just trying to ease the friction so the community and Coinbase can benefit from this event. ",

While I certainly advocate for open question formats, someone proposing an action at MakerDAO will never entitle you (Recognized Delegate status or not) to have your questions answered live by the proposal author. Authors, like every other entity operating in a DAO, have agency. I will defend every participants\u2019 right to participate in our system as they see fit, understanding that actions have consequences and people like yourself may view anything but unfeathered access with skepticism. Appreciate the feedback as always however, if you\u2019d like to make proposal requirements more strict happy to suggest how that might be done by proposing a MIP. ",

I would love to improve our batting average! But the way to do so isn\u2019t by being unnecessarily restrictive on how that call takes place. A really important concept in building community and meaningful relationships is meeting people where they are. Coinbase (for cited compliance concerns) isn\u2019t willing to have a free-form question call with the community, but they are willing to do this. So for a few hours of labor we get to ask the questions posed in this thread by a multitude of members of the community. You are entitled to not see that as a positive, but in my role as Governance Facilitator I have been elected by the DAO to assist in promoting good governance. That starts with meaningful discourse and debate. Being hostile to someone going beyond the minimum requirements for MIP submission is not a way to increase governance participation (an item considered crucial by most for meaningful decentralization). For weeks you were calling for Coinbase to get on a call with Maker, I understand that this was not the interaction you had in mind, however the old adage \u201cyou catch more flies with honey\u201d comes to mind here  .
