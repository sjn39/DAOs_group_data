                    "content": "I want to continue the conversations started here and elsewhere to talk around business strategy and build on @SebVentures Crypto Banking 101 article in the interest of providing some framework for the discussion. Seb\u2019s article concludes with the question:  \u201cHow do you manage your balance sheet to meet the constraint of solvency and liquidity while optimizing the spread between founding and investment rate?\u201d  The merits of promoting MakerDAO as a crypto bank may be debatable (and I\u2019ll come back to that) but the mechanics at play in MakerDAO appear to be consistent with that of a bank, as Sebastien has defined it. If we accept this, then we can start thinking about what it means to optimize our spread.  How do we maximize the number of Dai in circulation? In other words, how do we increase the supply of, and demand for, Dai? Adding new collateral types and raising debt ceilings increases supply while demand grows through B2B integrations and the development of B2C markets.   What types of value have been realized through B2B integrations and which types of integrations currently hold the most potential value?   Similarly, what types of value have been realized by building B2C markets and which types of efforts currently hold the most potential value?   It\u2019s worth remembering that it\u2019s easier to see the value in existing markets than ones that have to be built, particularly with regard to B2C. We may generate more money in the short-term by tapping into existing markets but the network effects in building new ones could have long-term returns that dwarf the value of those potential short-term gains. In any case, I think it would be particularly interesting to hear from @Nadia and the Growth team as well as the rest of the community about where we\u2019ve seen successes we can double down on.  To what degree should we publicly discuss business strategy?   Given its position and resources, what investments offer the best risk/return for MakerDAO? This question is ultimately about treasury management and I see two sides to that coin:   How do we effectively organize and manage a workforce?   What\u2019s the best way to manage risk while maximizing the returns on our treasury?   We\u2019re navigating #4 by addressing issues around this transition to the Core Unit model. Are there things besides MKR vesting we might want to standardize across Core Units or other issues worth addressing? I\u2019ve heard @NikKunkel talk about leveraging our oracles and been curious myself about what sort of opportunities might lie in our networks of people and companies supplying digital and real-world assets. What\u2019s the next step for the reserve asset of the Web3 economy? Barter? Insurance? VC? I don\u2019t expect detailed answers but it might be helpful to think about how to tackle this question: do we need a Core Unit or Working Group to explore this topic?  Closing Thoughts Optimizing our spread is critical but it\u2019s also worth considering what effects any strategies we pursue could have on things like the value of our brand. To return to that point about positioning MakerDAO as a crypto bank, I understand where @flipflopflapdelegate\u2019s coming from with the point about people having mixed feelings about banks. In my experience, \u201cBanks/corporations suck\u201d is a popular narrative with certain audiences and especially those in crypto but it also comes off as immature to others. Fortunately, we have the freedom to be a bank in the ways we want to be a bank and be whatever else we want in the ways that we don\u2019t. So, what do you think we should be? ",

This interview (not sure it\u2019s free) is enlightening on the opportunities there. This is why I think we should develop RWA in trade finance. Because USDT might be convenient to use yet, but DAI will let them get loans and a savings account. There is also no on/off ramp for DAI, with the PSM you can get no slippage. 1 DAI = $1 (with up to 0.1% fees)  If well managed, the peg deviation could be an old story. Quite sure this is not known (and we never commit to manage it well). ",

Adding more collaterals to the protocol and raising debt ceilings increases supply capacity, but we also have to reach out to people/companies who will use that credit line. And we also have to look for distribution channels that create Dai demand. Integrations that bring the most value to the protocol are the ones that give Dai exposure to more than 1M potential users, could bring $1B in deployable collateral, or could open a vault for a 10M Dai outstanding loan (Tier 1 partnerships). Regarding B2C, it\u2019s not BD/Growth focus because we integrate with partners to reach users with a segmented and straightforward use case for them. @seth Who would you say are Maker\u2019s consumers?

Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m newer to the community, but I would love to learn more about our largest customers and what they use DAI/vaults for, as well as why they use it over competitors. Knowing this, we can push our existing advantages over competitors and better understand our weaknesses and invest capital to mitigate them and potentially turn them into strengths. I want to emphasize @MarianoDP 's post from the other thread:  We pretty much talk with every single institution that now uses USDC. Some of them started using DAI, before USDC, and all of them always tell us the same thing.  We need powerful APIs We need 1 to 1 Peg We need liquidity Decentralization is not a value proposition for us Higher returns on DEFI is a \u201cnice to have\u201d   Solving our customers problems should be our #1 job and it seems clear to me we should be investing considerable resources here. The better we serve our customers, the more business they\u2019ll do with us. The more business they do with us, the more likely they are to become advocates of our product.  Currently, the state of the institutional market (and also during the last two years) has been very clear on its response:  On ramp / off ramp operations 1 to 1 peg at any moment is the holy grail. If they convert some of those USDC/USDT to DAI is for farming and returns opportunities, that\u00b4s it. Once those opportunities are no longer in the market, they will go back to USDC/USDT\u2026    \u2026 I would love the community to develop a product that can offer on/off-ramp 1 to 1 with a powerful API like USDC because I know that we can EASILY eat the market if we have that. Still, we have to be realistic and we don\u2019t have that at the moment so we need to work very hard to keep DAI gaining market share.  We\u2019ve been able to grow tremendously fast despite the disadvantages Mariano outlined in his posts vs USDC. Let\u2019s invest whatever we need to and catch up. Lastly I\u2019ll tag @g_dip since I know he was working on a response to my question in the last thread regarding how we can get this done  ",

Nadia:  Who would you say are Maker\u2019s consumers?   I\u2019m open to changing my mental model but I see Maker\u2019s consumers as anyone with a Maker Vault and I\u2019d distinguish that from stakeholders, who I consider synonymous with the community at this point. I\u2019d say that group includes everybody from potential consumers and those engaging with our web properties and social channels to MKR holders and governance. Forgive me if that\u2019s an underwhelming answer but like Aes said, the more we know about who our customers are and why they use vaults, the more we can double down on our advantages and mitigate our weaknesses. Do you have any more insight you can share about what these segmented cases are, what we\u2019re seeing in different tiers, etc? or perhaps this is a longer conversation it would be better to have offline once we have more clarity on Core Units.

                    "content": "Just going to venture outside of my core domain for a bit. B2B vs. B2C, why not both? Lots of chat and some forums posts about abandoning B2C for B2B lately and I wanted to register strong objections to this way of thinking.  I\u2019m not going to argue for the inverse of this, but more for the appropriate B2B strategy for a decentralized protocol, and to call out a massive blind spot everyone is missing with B2C. B2B can be an effective profit-seeking strategy, but it carries a number of risks.  I suggest we make a checklist for any potential B2B engagement.  This list is meant as a starting place, and not an exhaustive list of all considerations.  I\u2019m just an engineer damnit.   Poor ROI.  The time invested on any such engagement should generate staggering amounts of new DAI supply with matched demand, while preserving peg stability.  For example, anything we spend 6 months on should come with an expectation that we generate somewhere upwards of a billion more DAI within the year of the end of that engagement.   Linear Scale.  While DAI supply is the ultimate measure for ROI, there are knock-on effects we get from choosing engagements where the end result impacts end-users. A big advantage to tech is that we can scale with network effects, it makes no sense to choose an engagement that could generate a billion DAI in a year, if we don\u2019t think that is 2 billion in two or 4 billion in three.   Rugged.  Many\u2026 many\u2026 many times throughout my career I\u2019ve seen an innovative or well executed idea by party A, sold to party B as a service, only so party B can learn more about that market, gain access to those users, and ultimately offer a competing product or bring the service in-house.  B2B relationships are not just fragile, they are almost always the vector by which party B rugs party A.  With too much reliance on a relationship like this to balance the peg by influencing DAI supply or demand, it could easily be an existential threat to the protocol.  I cannot stress enough the risk of this dynamic.  It\u2019s not the exception to the rule, this is almost always the rule itself.  We built a moat, don\u2019t be too eager to fill it in.   Lack of Vision.  Banking the world\u2019s unbanked.  Unbanking the banked.  Enabling self-sovereign finance.  Permissionless.  Decentralized.  Censorship resistant. Voluntarism. Transparency for the powerful, privacy for the individual.  This is vision.  This is the cyberpunk fever dream.  The promise that the world\u2019s system of value, its base economy, isn\u2019t orchestrated by the elite and powerful any longer.  That they can\u2019t steal your life savings through inflation, that they can\u2019t fund their wars, that they can no longer death march (sorry LFW) the world\u2019s population back to serfdom.  This promise is what attracted most of us to the space.  We found elegance in mathematical constructions and properties of the universe that could allow for a paradigm shift.  The old system is build on coercion and violence, but those tools are meaningless under this new paradigm.  Violence and coercion can\u2019t stop gravity, and so it is true with crypto.  This is the narrative.  It appeals to the world\u2019s population, not some business.  It\u2019s hard to get excited about \u201cmaking the world a better place through capital efficient B2B blockchain relationships \u2026\u201d.        This last bit is a good time to transition to the point I want to make.  Abandoning B2C relationships, that is, relationships between the Maker Protocol and its users, is a perilous idea.  Where do you think the DAI supply came from?  It came from appealing to users directly with the vision I mentioned above, that lead to a spark, which ignited a movement.  B2C isn\u2019t just some old business model that we have to pivot away from because of ethereum gas fees, it\u2019s the entire funnel.  For every 100 or 1000 users you engage, some small percent of them go on to build on the protocol, become part of governance, build a business on top of Maker, or suggest to their employer they use Maker as part of their critical infrastructure.  This is the capital battery.  It\u2019s not even about where income comes from, it\u2019s about where innovation comes from.  Can we point at where most of the DAI supply comes from, yes.  Is it directly end-users, no.  But ask yourself why those other projects are here, how they learned about us, what drew them to want to use the Maker Protocol and DAI in the first place, and you will see it\u2019s end-users that lead them here. At meetups and conferences, people built on top of the maker protocol because it is innovative and permissionless.  These small projects have grown to be some of the largest in the space, and DAI itself is a cornerstone of DeFi.  This is the hard-to-bootstrap network effects most modern startups strive for, and from reading the forums and chat, it seems much of the community is resigned to let it wither on the Vine.  If this funnel dries up, the protocol dries up.  There is nothing left for other businesses to want to integrate with and the outcome would be well deserved for selling out our core vision. I\u2019m not suggesting we put all our efforts into B2C and abandon B2B relationships.  I\u2019m suggesting a balance.  Choose those B2B relationships very carefully, and put the rest of the effort into the B2C vision, feed the innovation battery, and reap the rewards.  I\u2019m not suggesting this will be easy.  Having to up the dust limits because of L1 gas makes achieving this vision all but impossible on mainnet.  But rather than pivot to some risky B2B model, we should look to scale horizontally to L2s, start thinking about how the protocol takes advantage of ETH2, and build something that people want to use and build on top of.  This will pay dividends in the future. We\u2019ve made an unbiased currency for the world, fueled by human values.  Let\u2019s finish the mission and scale it for humans.  The world can\u2019t afford to have us fail. ",

We are not abandoning users, it\u2019s mainly that we don\u2019t have any customer-facing app (assuming Oasis is outside of the DAO) nor any plan to have one. We don\u2019t have any piece of customer development research. We are working with @Nadia to increase DAI position on a CeFi app. That could lead to thousands of new DAI users and some millions DAI. For almost nothing. Centrifuge is exposing hundreds (thousands?) of wealthy customers to DAI. On the other end, you can travel through Africa, speak to thousands of users, and onboard a hundred of them for a few DAI. You just spend more than what you earn. I spoke already about how an L2 DAI-oriented app would be nice. The SaaS business space uses the following chart to model the number of clients you need to scale (usually expressed to achieve $100M revenues). ARPA is the average revenue per account (annual). So with whales customers (10M ARPA), you need 10 of those. Let\u2019s say we need both supply and demand and take a 2% interest rate on both, 10M ARPA is 500M DAI (either lend to MakerDAO by holding DAI or borrower from MakerDAO by using a vault). Those are Nexo-type customers. On the other end of the scale, it means we need 100M users holding 50 DAI to achieve the same result. Hunting for stuff above a deer is easy, you just look for them. You see how much time you spent and what it did provide. For those smaller, you need a more elaborate strategy. You can hook them with content marketing but then what is the call to action?

Now, when we have few big B2B partners, generating many millions of DAI demand per day for us, it is easy to forget about those many small but dedicated B2C customers who might have brought in only a few thousands of Dai. As we can learned from the \u201cvampire attacks\u201d, the dedicated customers can be very important when the real battle starts for customers in the market.  B2B customers also important, but they will be the first movers when they get a slightly better offer elsewhere. ",

Just with the fact of being in another blockchain people will use it ASAP, cuz people trust Maker and know how big and amazing it is.

If we can find an answer to that question, we can create a B2C strategy.  Are Dai users the ones looking for an alternative from their local currency (emergent markets problem)?  If so, we can\u2019t go out and talk with those users about Dai without having an on/off ramp that onboards them to Dai, a wallet with a super friendly UX with almost zero transaction fees so they can use that Dai and some DeFi services to help them to invest. I will take Argentina as an example of this (all of these examples are also what we understand as a B2B strategy):  Easy on/off ramps (TiendaDolar integrated Dai on BSC because of gas fees)   image2762\u00d7998 154 KB   Wallets with a layer 2/other networks vision (Bitera is a Dai exclusive wallet that allows you to choose between using a custodial (zero fees) or a non custodial wallet)   image2364\u00d71338 280 KB   yields on your Dai balance. (Buenbit gives you an 8% over your Dai balance. Of course, people could get a higher yield on DeFi, but they have this great UX and local support that helps people who is not into crypto to trust in Dai)   image2396\u00d71228 264 KB  If we are going to reach those users, we have first to prepare the field. Every marketing action should be tied with a call to action to measure the results. We can\u2019t talk about Dai as an alternative currency if they don\u2019t have the tools to access to it. That\u2019s why our strategy here is B2B, working together with our partners to reach those users with a product.  Are Maker users devs who are looking to create new stuff using the protocol?  If so, we need to have Dai in every network (layer 2, side-chain, blockchain). We need to work with the other networks to create APIs or documentation to help these devs create new products. We need a team (what the integrations team used to do for the foundation) who can work with all those devs to help them integrate Dai or a PSM that connects our vaults with other networks\u2026 Then we can think about B2C campaigns.  Are Maker users people who can open a vault?  With the dust as it is, the gas fees, and the UX, it\u2019s hard to think we can launch a B2C campaign and attract users to open a vault. I think it makes more sense to go after CeFi or other crypto projects (what @SebVentures mentioned)  Are Maker users our community? MKR holders?  Delegation, gas fees, how to incentivize participation? What is our strategy here? Do we want more funds participating in governance? More individuals? ",

Vaults, Dai, and the Protocol itself can be considered separate products and I\u2019d consider Vaults that use RWA as a separate product from Vaults that use DA (digital assets). Some customers use Vaults, some go directly to Dai and I think it\u2019s worth acknowledging these as different segments. To serve those looking to use Dai as an alternative to their local currency, would it be more effective to focus on making it easier for individuals to open Vaults or to create on/off ramps to fiat?
