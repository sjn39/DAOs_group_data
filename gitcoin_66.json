As of now, only ERC-20 tokens manually approved by Gitcoin can be used for rewarding bounty hunters. This slows down Gitcoin adoption by DAOs that have a not yet approved token. To make Gitcoin more permissionless and more decentralized, I propose we open up for the opportunity for Gitcoin Bounties to be paid for with any ERC-20 token on Ethereum.     Yes: Permissionless choice of ERC-20 token No: Gitcoin decides which ERC-20 tokens are allowed     0 voters     ",
