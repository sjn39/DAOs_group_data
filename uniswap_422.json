We need to be the first to implement solid rewards for owning uni tokens. However, their needs to be guidelines\u2026 To earn uni by holding uni, you need to hold your uni! hold for a certain amount of time and you can begin earning. Set it up in stages so that people know if they hold their uni for longer and longer the rewards will be more. Though we need to set a cap, this should be a certain number of uni tokens owned by someone that can earn, say 2000 tokens earn, just throwing it out there. That stops whales, makes thing even steven. Only one wallet. Im sure that is a good start\u2026 People are using the platform and there are doing well. People aren\u2019t holding the tokens. No attraction there, I\u2019m not attracted to them dumping, let\u2019s release the news of this happening, get new user to hold, let\u2019s build the token price, make it less apt to dump, and for sure continue to grow more and more. Everything else that is done with uniswap need to be done with confidence, building trust with the user being first priority. We don\u2019t have to offer everything right away. But we could make uniswap and it\u2019s token the one stop shop!! ",
