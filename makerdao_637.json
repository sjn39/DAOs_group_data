Phil helped create the first Core Unit proposed on MakerDAO (Real-World Finance) and, as the lead on New Silver, made possible the first RWA loan from MakerDAO thanks to his real-estate knowledge. New Silver is still the biggest RWA borrower on MakerDAO to date. He also worked on FortunaFi and saw the value of having a senior position in the nascent space of revenue-based finance. Phil was a true pioneer and helped greatly the cause of RWA in DeFi. Moreover, he was also kind and good to people. He had great empathy and used it in deals to move forward in the interest of all parties. Phil was hard working. Revolutionizing RWA in DeFi with MakerDAO was only a part-time activity. Last summer, he joined IOHK as a product manager on Cardano. He never refused a challenge. My thoughts go toward his family. ",
