                    "content": "Background Recently we\u2019ve had a couple of potential issues come up around executive bundling with regards to technical changes. Initially, we had the proposed flopper change detailed here. Then, more recently we had the activation of the Governance Security Module, detailed here. These technical changes have brought to light a question as to how we handle the bundling of executive votes with monetary policy changes. Thus far we have largely managed to avoid controversy around the issue, however it makes more sense if we can agree on a policy and vote on-chain before we run into another issue of this nature. Previous discussion has happened in the threads linked below. My hope is that we can use this thread as a single point of discussion and agreement going forward. To this purpose, I will be locking the previous threads, and leaving a link to this signal request. Non-Emergency Technical Changes Emergency Technical Changes  The Negatives to Bundling The issue with bundling monetary policy with technical changes (both emergency or non-emergency) is that it has the potential to either:  Force voters to vote for something they do not want. (In the case of them liking one change, and disliking the other.) Force voters to vote against something that they do want. (in the case of them disliking one change so much that they cannot countenance the other.)  In the extremes, this sort of bundling can:  Lead to us adopting bad monetary policy (because we needed an emergency technical fix.) Lead to abuse of the system and the aggregation of highly charged political changes. Lead to governance paralysis at a time when we need to be as nimble as possible (for example an unacceptable monetary policy change gets bundled with an emergency technical fix.) <Further negatives here! If you have more disadvantages, please bring them up below, and I will append them to this list.>  The Positives to Bundling On the other hand, proponents of this system name the following advantages:  So long as changes are not controversial, it allows us to make more changes more quickly. This can be particularly beneficial in terms of technical changes. Having less votes reduces voter exhaustion, potentially increasing or helping to maintain long-term engagement. <Further positives here! If you have more advantages, please bring them up below, and I will append them to this list.>   Moving forward to resolution with this issue, I propose we take the following approach (and will continue assuming consent to this approach unless people express their discontent).  Given that we have already had two signalling threads with positive consensus for desired change, I do not believe it is necessary to put forward a \u2018general opinion\u2019 poll as detailed in Stage 1 of the Current Signalling Process. Stage 1 would normally contain a gathering of potential solutions to this problem. Given the discussion of the issue so far, and the relative simplicity of the subject, I am also not convinced that this is necessary. Given the above, I will begin this thread at stage 2: A multiple choice vote on the specific options of how to handle executive bundling with technical changes in the future. Given the holiday, in three weeks we will review the outcome of these signal polls, and (given consensus) move on-chain. If we cannot find consensus, we will attempt to generate alternative options and then vote on those.   In voting in these polls, vote for all options that you agree with. Due to the nature of these polls, any non-conflicting consensus options will be put to an on-chain poll. A word on terminology: Supersede: Replace the contents of the executive vote. Anything replaced is not voted on in an executive vote, and is essentially \u2018skipped\u2019 for that week. Separate: Create multiple consecutive executive votes in the same week to push through the different changes. Bundle: Include multiple sets of changes in the same poll.     Non-emergency technical changes should supersede non-emergency monetary policy changes. Non-emergency technical changes should be separated from non-emergency monetary policy changes. Non-emergency technical changes should be bundled with non-emergency monetary policy changes. Emergency technical changes should supersede non-emergency monetary policy changes. Emergency technical changes should be separated from non-emergency monetary policy changes. Emergency technical changes should be bundled with non-emergency monetary policy changes. Abstain (I just want to see results) Abstain (I have no opinion) Abstain (I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgeable on the subject) Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection)     0 voters     Poll is now closed.

Mitote:  Its also not okay only because the monetary policy is insensitive/non controversial. The time it takes for an emergency technical fix to pass might be super important. IMO more important than an inaccurate monetary policy change.   So here\u2019s a summary of my views on this:  The time it takes for an emergency technical fix to pass might be super important. (as you said) Adding a monetary policy component to an emergency-fix executive can only slow down the passing of that executive.  Either the monetary policy change is non-controversial, and it\u2019s just as fast, or it is potentially negative and it causes any number of voters to hesitate for any amount of time. Therefore there is no benefit to bundling the changes, and a cost that could vary wildly depending on the contents of the bundle.  I agree that the argument is more nuanced for non-emergency technical changes though, hence why I split the two cases in the poll above. ",

What i mean is everything is slow. To make things looks good and doing good, there should be a way to make the hole process faster , but way faster. Either the Emergency Shut-off or just the fact that you make a daily transaction with your online wallet, is too slow. Solving this issue, would be like, something crazy good for MakerDAO and in general. Then we would not need to consider all of the good ideas that we talk about, they would become a Low-Priority changes or work-order , situations. For me the monetary policy changes then we would not need to talk about it anymore because it would not be a issue anymore, the same for the vote, we should not need to rush even if right now is almost like a Gold-Rush period where a lot of things evolute super fast. Not sure if you will like they way i think about it, but speeding this up, would fix many things and the Gouvernance-at-a-Glance would go nice and easy. What do you think ? ",

Finding a solution i don\u2019t think this forum is great for this since it\u2019s mainly for Gouvernance and his attribution or direct applications, but it does have a  subsection where we could use for this, fresh idea.I think this would have direct impact but would lead to many more things. Maybe i just dream about it but that is what i can tell from personal experience since i use Cryptocurrency or tokens etc.But this is just a small idea here on the side because i was reading you and i found it interesting what you said about bureaucracy elimination.  We already eliminate so many of them creating the Cryptocurrency\u2026 For the one that work in those area they will probably not be happy, but for the others like me, the idea of having much more in my pocket is pretty interesting. MD5, SHA-1, SHA256, SHA512, MD5 produce 32 hash while SHA512 is doing 128 hash . A lot of encoding that is not relevant here but that is my point. Feel free to give your opinion about it. But to reply for the part you were missing, i think we are giving too much power about the Emergency Shut-Down to the community. This is a decision and action that when it will happen you cannot start to make post on forum that somebody is hacking us and they took all. Just to make sure what i say is related to this post and clarify that this have direct link to monetary policy. ",

Summary It\u2019s now the 13th January, and the poll is sitting at 19 voters. Only two options presented have >50% agreement: 63% - 12 Votes - Emergency technical changes should supersede non-emergency monetary policy changes. 52% - 10 Votes - Emergency technical changes should be separated from non-emergency monetary policy changes. Given these are mutual exclusive, it is fair to say that the consensus option in the case of emergency technical changes is that they should supercede planned non-emergency monetary policy votes. In the case of Non-Emergency technical changes, no option has reached the threshold of 50% that is currently deemed to indicate \u2018consensus\u2019. The highest voted option is: 47% - 9 Votes - Non-emergency technical changes should be separated from non-emergency monetary policy changes. Given the outcome of this vote, I am advocating for the Governance Facilitator @rich.brown  to create an on-chain vote that concerns emergency technical changes only. I recommend that this on-chain vote should be created in the form laid out below, but I am open to adjustments from the Governance Facilitator in the case of concerns over wording.  On-chain Poll Wording Title:  In the case where emergency technical changes to the Dai Credit System are required, should those changes supersede (replace) non-emergency monetary policy changes in the next executive vote bundle? Description: If passed, when emergency technical changes to the Dai Credit System are required they will supersede non-emergency monetary policy changes when the next executive bundle is created. The decision over whether or not a technical change is an Emergency is determined by the Technical / Development team employed by the Maker Foundation. In the future, this authority may be voted to an alternative entity. The decision over whether or not a monetary policy change is an Emergency is determined by the Interim Risk Team employed by the Maker Foundation. In the future, this authority may be voted to an alternative entity. When non-emergency monetary policy changes are superseded in an emergency:  They are not added to the next executive vote spell. They may or may not be added to a subsequent executive vote spell at the discretion of the Governance Facilitator once the current governance period (currently one week) has passed.  Background and discussion: Signal Request: How do we handle executive bundling in relation to technical changes? Options:  Yes/No  ",

It is actually matter of using this tools In little different way Lets have polls that never expires. One for each parameter: Separate polls for SCD/MCD SF Separate poll for MCD DSR Separate YES/NO poll for every feature of a system which might be enabled/disabled (Governance Security Module is good example) Every predefined period of time snapshot of results are being taken and if it is different than snapshot from previous period then Executive Vote, that reflects this changes, is being formed and waits for acceptance If Executive Vote is not accepted, next Executive Vote will be constructed based on next snapshot of polls results. This way any controversy with reintroducing changes like GSM will not be possible. There simply will be YES/NO poll and every executive vote will reflect current status of this poll. Polls should have quorum requirement to have results to be included in Executive Vote. It would prevent changes to be introduced by small amount of MKR. That creates very transparent proces of introducing changes to the system and is in line with \u201ccontinous approval\u201d concept of Maker governance. That also enables any MKR holder to change his mind on any matter at any time. There is very little space left for subjectivity or \u201cbureaucratic process\u201d. ",

As Jernej suggested, a new thread would be a better location for continuing said discussion.     andytudhope:  but it seems like this poll simply gives (perhaps undue) powers to vague entities within the foundation   Vague entities is a fair criticism especially in regards to the technical team, in retrospect I should have made this more concrete. I would disagree that these powers are undue though, the described entities are best positioned to judge whether any problem should be deemed an emergency.     andytudhope:  without taking into account some of the really interesting suggestions made in this thread about continuous polling?   The suggestions were largely off-topic for this thread, and the discussion appeared to end without any call for action taking place, as I said above a new thread summarising the idea would be better place for following up on it. This specific poll has now moved on-chain, so to a large extent it is out of our hands at this point. If you do not believe it should be actioned please vote against it.  ",
