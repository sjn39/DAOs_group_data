However, this 17k came from one voter vs 7 unique yes\u2019. https://mkrgov.science/poll/255 It\u2019s hard to say the motivations of this one No voter but due to the crazy yield farming and gas prices going on lately I feel this poll deserves another shot. Therefore I am asking the community to signal whether we should re-add this poll into next Monday\u2019s (August 24th) votes. Should we resubmit Inclusion Poll for MIP12c2-SP4 - LRC Collateral Onboarding on Monday, August 24th, 2020?     Yes No Abstain     0 voters     I will run this poll until 2020-08-23T16:00:00Z as it should be easy for @LongForWisdom to resubmit. If he has objections I will end earlier for him to review as well as make sure there is decent community participation to reach consensus. I look forward to your comments and participation. Edit: Based on @LongForWisdom\u2019s guidance, this signal request (if passed) would set the expectation to the working group that the community would like to see LRC resubmitted into next months governance cycle.

Alternatively, I believe someone else could take over authorship, provided Nik and @charlesstlouis agree.

Given how few addresses voted in the LRC inclusion poll, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to submit it again for September and hope for more turnout and a positive outcome. ",

As a general rule, if something is voted out of the monthly cycle at the inclusion stage, it seems a bit scummy to allow a re-vote in the same month because the community didn\u2019t like the outcome. To some extent, I\u2019d also like larger MKR voters to see this as a relatively low-cost lesson and hopefully an incentive to vote more consistently in on-chain polls. ",
