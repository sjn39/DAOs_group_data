                    "content": "For the last couple of weeks, a group of smart people and I have been working on what would eventually become a MIP set that, we believe, is the right way for Maker to move forward, as the Foundation dissolves and the responsibilities are taken over by the Community. The first step is to lay down the roadmap to facilitate this transition. Context As we take another step towards decentralization, we have begun implementing temporary solutions to deal with situations where the Foundation cannot meet Governance\u2019s requirements. Several Contributors and Facilitators have voiced their concerns to achieve autonomy and flexibility, while Community members search for ways to collaborate. What\u2019s more, the DAO could benefit from top-talent that the Foundation has spent years hiring and training. Phase-based approach We don\u2019t believe it is entirely possible to achieve the Target Operating Model in the first iteration. The MIPs model allows us to discover the shortcomings of the current MIP Set, amend it, and integrate the temporary measures built around its weaknesses. phase1486\u00d7360 38.5 KB DAO Primitives Simplicity and modularity have driven this MIP Set. The main idea behind it is to keep the basic framework flexible so that the Community can use it in multiple situations in an unbiased way. As we learn to self-organize, we will be able to upgrade the Framework to adjust upcoming needs. Core Objective of the Framework For the DAO to grow its value and keep running its services, it needs to make sure that its available resources find their way towards the contributors able to perform certain activities. This Framework aims to help organize both the flow of priorities and resources, not only enticing as much talent as possible to cross the chasm (from the Foundation to the DAO), but also to attract top talent from the broader DeFi talent pool. model1016\u00d7894 52.8 KB The Core Unit It contains a Mandate, akin to a question that the Facilitator must answer with the available resources. The Budget One or multiple budgets per Core Unit; each with its implementation and its breakdown. The Facilitator The most trusted actor in the Community; interacts with Governance and the Contributors to organize activities to achieve the Objectives. It contains the name and information and the commitment (the how). Contributors The groups of people performing the tasks to maintain and grow the protocol can focus on their job while the Facilitator acts as a proxy and deals with the bureaucracy of interacting with Maker Governance. Trust, rather than control Governance is not looking to micromanage any given group. Arguably most MKR holders prefer a relatively hands-off approach and to be consulted in critical decisions (potentially contentious). The Framework provides Core Unit Facilitators with enough flexibility and margin to quickly react to new events. In return, they\u2019re expected to provide clarity into their actions and expenditures. While Governance has methods to remove a Core Unit Facilitator (non-performing, rogue, etc.), these agents need to receive the corresponding remuneration and enough trust and autonomy upfront to perform well.

Yes. The steps are:   You (or anyone) can propose a Core Unit. This is a container of people/companies/groups that work on a certain task: e.g., risk evaluation, marketing, smart contracts, etc   You propose yourself as Facilitator of the Core Unit. The Facilitator is the link between the DAO and the Core Unit. He is in charge interacting/informing the DAO and also coordinate the work of the people/companies working within the Core Unit (Note: the latter do not need to spend their time of Governance, they just need to talk with the facilitator).   You propose a Budget for your Core Unit. When/if approved, this is a stream of DAI that will reach the Facilitator at each time unit. The Facilitator then distributes this (probably automatically, but we\u2019ll see how it develops) to all people/companies working in their Core Unit.   That\u2019s it! It\u2019s very simple, but this also means that it is flexible! We hope to start seeing the first proposal in the next month or so. And then we will iterate and build better and better processes. I think there is reason to be optimistic. ",

Planet_X:  Domain is renamed Core Unit   Not quite. A Domain nowadays is something close to \u201ca group of talent with some common skills\u201d. While it is entirely possible that this is translated 1:1, I can also see Core Units appearing to solve other pressing issues that Governance might have.     Planet_X:  Domain Facilitator is renamed Mandated Actor   A mandated actor is a generic name for the Core Unit Facilitator.     Planet_X:  pluss there is now a bit of a budget   Now there\u2019s a lot of a budget. With this MIP set, a Core Unit can get approved and expect a stream of payments; Governance needs to approve it once (and any subsequent modifications) but:  Contributors benefit from knowing that they will be paid. Governance knows that the Facilitator will administer that budget to achieve the Core Unit Mandate.      Planet_X:  How is this bringing us closer to becoming the Linux of Money?   This is the first step so that:  any group that brings value to Governance can be proposed and get a budget. it works with current solutions (manual suck()), solutions being developed (MIP34: Keg Streaming Payments Module), and any future solution that we haven\u2019t yet thought about (bonuses/rewards/etc). more importantly: groups can organize in different ways according to their jurisdiction/processes/the desired outcome. For example:  a Facilitator could set up a company and decide to make contributors employees (with the corresponding benefits). or they could decide to contribute as freelancers. or a group could create a DAO / LAO to organize that group that is providing these services to Maker).

For this reasons, it will be much more governance-energy efficient to have fewer and bigger CoreUnits (like 10 in total, or even less at the beginning). ",

How do Domain teams work with this model? Isn\u2019t this basically the same as Domain Teams, except with the added budget component? If this is meant to replace domain teams, couldn\u2019t we make it simpler by applying some of the principles of this model to the current MIPs behind Domain Team Onboarding?   Note on Domain Team Onboarding: It used to be MIP7: Onboarding and Offboarding Domain Teams (Collateral Onboarding) as the sole process for onboarding SC, Oracles, Risk, and Legal Domain Teams. That evolved when governance passed MIP23: Domain Structure and Roles which:  Better defined Domain Teams as consisting of Domain Facilitators & Domain Contributors. Included the Domain Definition Subproposals Included generic Domain team onboarding and offboarding Subproposal processes.  This allowed governance to escape the constraint of \u201ccollateral onboarding\u201d related Domain teams as outlined in MIP7. Now MIPs could facilitate onboarding of other Domain Team types, like the Operational Support Domain. Now, we have this proposal and I\u2019m not sure how it disrupts, replaces, or supplements this structure.  I imagined for a moment that core units would represent the various functions, and that within them there would be the possibility of housing multiple Domain Teams of the same category. Though it seems that this is not the intended design from my reading of these MIPs. Edit: Okay I am seeing some mention of Domains in MIP39  They are the basic units of domain work that Maker Governance is able to oversee\u2026   Core Units are a primary DAO Primitive used to enable Maker Governance to signal and prioritize the main objectives the domains need to solve.   Core Units are at the intersection of Domains, which denotes skillsets and capabilities, and Core Objectives which denote cross-domain long term work streams. A Core Unit can participate in multiple Core Objectives, and can fall under multiple Domains.  This still leaves me unsatisfied though. Are Core Units better mapped to objectives rather than teams then? Is this example realistic?; Core Unit: Oracles as a Service Mandate: Work with domain teams to kickstart Oracles as a Service. -> Oracle Domain Team -> Smart Contracts Team  In this example, the Core Unit would be in charge of managing Oracles as a Service. The Unit Facilitator will work with Domain Facilitators to achieve this objective. Meanwhile, Oracle Teams have their usual duties, and so does Smart Contracts Team. Is that closer to how you envision this structure working? Would love some more example Core Units and how they would work across Domain Teams. ",

                    "content": "So I have a few questions/concerns. I can see the appeal from a governance perspective that detailed Core Units helps governance determine what specific \u201cprojects\u201d they want to prioritize and how many resources to allocate to each one. However from an execution point of view this makes it really difficult for teams like mine that span multiple Core Units to wade through the administrative overhead that entails. Let me elaborate using the Oracle Domain Team as an example. The Oracle Domain Team works on the following items/responsibilities each of which could be its own Core Unit.  General Oracle Protocol development and maintenance Collateral Onboarding Developing Oracles as a revenue-generating Business on behalf of the DAO Creating bespoke Oracle solutions for exotic collateral types (i.e. LP tokens, RWA) Managing Oracle and Feed upgrades and deployments (usually 2x a month) Reviewing and Processing Whitelisting Requests for Oracles Budgeting/Payments: Collecting invoices from Feeds and distributing Oracle payments, onboarding new Feeds, etc.  I\u2019m definitely interesting in spinning out of the Foundation with my team and starting my own independent company to continue executing on all of the current responsibilities listed above. I think my team has been doing an excellent job jugging these different responsibilities. However, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to have Core Units be so specific that I then have to apply to be a Facilitator for each one, create a budget for each one, and treat each one separately. For example, let\u2019s say I have 6 engineers on my team that are costing me 800k salary + benefits/insurance. I\u2019d like to be able to tell the DAO I can execute on the above core objectives for $1M rather than piecemeal together a bunch of separate contracts for each Core Unit to try to scrounge together a budget number that may or may not add up to being able to afford to pay my team. It\u2019s possible, but why would I want to waste my time that I could be doing actual work dealing with this kind of overhead. Now let\u2019s say Governance decides to remove one of those Core Units or give that responsibility to another Domain Team. Now I can\u2019t afford to pay my team anymore. I think it makes more sense to have Core Units be much higher level like an \u201cOracle Core Unit\u201d for which there is one facilitator, with multiple Domain Teams. The Facilitator comes up with a plan that shows all the responsibilities that Core Unit is responsible for, the resource allocation between each one, and the proposed total budget to execute on that Core Unit. Governance then gives feedback on the proposal and changes are incorporated. After Governance has passed the proposal and Facilitators get access to budgets, Domain Teams that want to do work in that Core Unit basically apply through the Facilitator rather than directly through Governance. This gives a much more stable platform for Domain Teams to build out sustainable-businesses and minimizes the amount of time wasted by Facilitators on governance overhead. ",

In this specific case (@NikKunkel 's group), yes, the new Core Unit might be a duplicate of an existing Domain Team.

They should not be necessarily identified with the Domain Teams considered so far in MakerDAO.

I don\u2019t think this is necessarily a bad thing. As the first stages of using this, I see all of the existing domain teams proposing themselves as Core Units (with budgets) so they can be paid by the protocol. As the DAO evolves, I expect to see the actual working structures in the DAO expand out into this framework over time. I consider this the best possible outcome when moving to a new framework. There should always be a way of transferring what currently exists 1-to-1 into the new framework. If the framework is good then what currently exists will adapt to the framework over time. ",

Credit to Mr. St.Louis here, a very successful job getting it to this point. @charlesstlouis Yet, Maker still lacks the framework and operational skeleton to bootstrap daily operations in a substantive way. Right now you have unpaid contributors working for a \u201cde-cent\u201d organization that makes profit\u2014not good or decent. The DAO needs to bring on a single project team under a substantial proposal to deliver an operational skeleton akin to the initial MIPS skeleton. This is the way to produce the work and constrain paths and research for Maker governance to vote on (similar to collateral on-boarding, but much, much more work). Pro-bono work will not work to get Maker over the hump and will leave it in a graveyard. Clear mutual incentives, win-win, works (e.g. RWA and Rabinowitz success) . These iterative improvements (domain team to core unit) represent the worst part of decentralization and government: a glacial pace that loses pace with innovation through a prohibitive and restrictive bureaucracy. LFW is right in suggesting that iterative improvements allow for easy transition, they also allow for minimum incremental novelty\u2013the death of innovation. It should not be understated, a glacial pace allows for and affords protection. A blanket approach of slow motion is not advantageous. This risk reward does not need to be the same in each domain (risk, technical protocol, business ops). True decentralization isn\u2019t the worst features of democracy concentrated, but the best features of centralization, de-risked. To date, you have fully centralized de-centralized decision making in every aspect, with burdensome documentation, not easily data, and you are still relying on trust (the opposite goal of decentralization and redundancy). It is better to assign responsibility, and align incentives so trust is not an issue. Trusting people with the expertise to execute and scoping which decisions are made at which level, is the key to empowering management and unlocking productivity. The Risk team seems to do this well and has been empowered since the early days to do so. In order to get a real operational skeleton in place, you need to delegate the project, fund it, and then run the project as it were an MIP with comment periods, then have governance vote on the concrete and proposed findings.  Note here again how effective Rabinowitz was in delivering real results. If this is something the community and DAO is interested, delivering on operational promise and keeping the DAO competitive\u2026 let me know. -Dao abides in non-action, Yet nothing is left undone.- ",

Thinking in the future of the DAO without the Foundation, having this Core Units and Domain Teams moving to them (like just a change of tittle we can say), and if all the frameworks looks good and easy to understand it might help governance to understand what the Protocol is going to pay and outsiders to consider joining the DAO and making Maker even much stronger.
