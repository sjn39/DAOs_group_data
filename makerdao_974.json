Unlike Uniswap, MakerDAO\u2019s frontends rely on quite a bit more than just on-chain components. For example, the Governance Portal (vote.makerdao.com) relies on critical governance data (eg. the markdown of executive proposals) hosted on GitHub. Building decentralized frontends isn\u2019t a silver bullet right now\u2014we need to consider where+how critical data is hosted and explore decentralisation on that front.
