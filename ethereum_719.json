It was heavily inspired by the work done here: ERC-1456 - Address Metadata JSON Schema But adds a validation layer that dapp developers can use with defined ontologies for their contracts. Expands support of contract metadata to include Semantic Web formats like RDFS/JSON-LD. Eventually would be interested in robust ways to actually cache this data and run SPARQL queries for governance model simulations.   github.com/ethereum/EIPs       Semantic Interface Registry / ERC820 Extension     by gh1dra   on 08:43PM - 26 Feb 19 UTC   1 commits   changed 1 files   with 164 additions   and 0 deletions.
