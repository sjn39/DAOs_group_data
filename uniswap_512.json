You can vote here: https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/3   UPDATE \u2014 December 16, 2020 Based on positive feedback from this post and the snapshot poll, we\u2019re going to move forward with a formal proposal. To support the project please delegate your votes to the \u201cautonomous proposal contract\u201d (a fork from Compound) deployed for this proposal here: 0x76f54Eeb0D33a2A2c5CCb72FE12542A56f35d67C With 10M UNI delegated to the above APC, anyone can call the contract to formally enter the proposal for voting. Once the proposal is live, there will be a 7 day period to reach quorom of 40M votes! Also, Ashleigh Schap has agreed to be the 5th committee member!  Summary: This post outlines a framework for funding Uniswap ecosystem development with grants from the UNI Community Treasury. The program starts small\u2014sponsoring hackathons, for example\u2014but could grow in significance over time (with renewals approved by governance) to fund core protocol development. Grants administration is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, and thus we propose a nimble committee of 6 members \u20141 lead and 5 reviewers\u2014to deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants, such that funding can be administered without having to put each application to a vote. We propose the program start with an initial cap of $750K per quarter and a limit of 2 quarters before renewal\u2014a sum that we feel is appropriate for an MVP relative to the size of the treasury that UNI token holders are entrusted with allocating. Purpose: The mission of the UGP is to provide valuable resources to help grow the Uniswap ecosystem. Through public discourse and inbound applications, the community will get first-hand exposure to identify and respond to the most pressing needs of the ecosystem, as well as the ability to support innovative projects expanding the capabilities of Uniswap. By rewarding talent early with developer incentives, bounties, and infrastructure support, UGP acts as a catalyst for growth and helps to maintain Uniswap as a nexus for DeFi on Ethereum. Quarterly Budget:  Max quarterly budget of up to $750k Budget and caps to be assessed every six months  Grant Allocation Committee:  Of 6 committee members: 1 lead and 5 reviewers Each committee has a term of 2 quarters (6 months) after which the program needs to be renewed by UNI governance Committee functions as a 4 of 5 multi-sig  Committee Members While the goals and priorities of the grant program will be thoroughly discussed and reviewed by the community through public discourse, the decision to start UGP by operating as a small committee is to ensure that the application and decision process will be efficient and predictable, so applicants have clear objectives and timely decisions. Starting with just six members enables the committee to efficiently fund projects with tight feedback loops and rapid iterations. The purpose of this committee would be to test the hypothesis that the Grants Program can successfully provide value for the UNI ecosystem before scaling the program. We suggest the grants program is administered by a single lead. Here we propose Kenneth Ng, a co-author of this post. Ken has helped grow the Ethereum Foundation Grants Program over the last two years in establishing high level priorities and adapting for the ecosystems needs. The other 5 committee members should be thought of as \u201creviewers\u201d \u2014 UNI community members who will keep the grants program functional by ensuring Ken is leading effectively and, of course, not absconding with funds. Part of the reviewers job is to hold the program accountable for success (defined below) and/or return any excess funds to the UNI treasury. Reviewers are not compensated as part of this proposal as we expect their time commitment to be minimal. Compensation for the lead role is discussed below, as we expect this to be a labor intensive role. Program Lead: Ken Ng (HL Creative Corp) Ecosystem Support Program at the Ethereum Foundation   Reviewer: Jesse Walden (o/b/o Unofficial LLC dba Variant Fund) Founder and Investor at Variant Fund (holds UNI)   Reviewer: Monet Supply Risk Analyst at MakerDAO   Reviewer: Robert Leshner Founder and CEO of Compound Finance   Reviewer: Kain Warwick Founder of Synthetix   Reviewer: Ashleigh Schap *Growth Lead, Uniswap (Company)   Methodology 1.1 Budget This proposal recommends a max cap of $750K per quarter, with the ability to reevaluate biannually at each epoch (two fiscal quarters). While the UGP Grants Committee will be the decision makers around individual grants, respective budgets, roadmaps, and milestones, any top-level changes to UGP including epochs and max cap, will require full community quorum (4% approval). The UGP will be funded by the UNI treasury according to the release schedule set out by the Uniswap team, whereby 43% of the UNI treasury is released over a four-year timeline. In Year 1 this will total to 172,000,000 UNI (~$344M as of writing). Taking into consideration the current landscape of ecosystem funding across Ethereum, the community would be hard-pressed to allocate even 5% of Year 1\u2019s treasury. For context Gitcoin CLR Round 7 distributed $725k ($450k in matched) across 857 projects and YTD, Moloch has granted just under $200k but in contrast, the EF has committed to somewhere in the 8 figure range. 1.2 Committee Compensation Operating a successful grants program takes considerable time and effort. Take, for instance, the EF Ecosystem Support Program, which has awarded grants since 2018, consists of an internal team at the Foundation as well as an ever increasing roster of community advisors in order to keep expanding and adapting to best serve the needs of the Ethereum ecosystem. While the structure of the allocation committee has six members, we propose that only the lead will be remunerated for their work in establishing the initial processes, vetting applications, and managing the program overall as this role is expected to be time consuming if the program is to be succesful. We propose that the other committee members be unpaid UNI ecosystem stakeholders who have an interest in seeing the protocol ecosystem continue to operate and grow. We propose the lead be compensated 25 UNI/hr (approximately $100 USD at time of this writing) capped at 30 hours/week. This compensation, along with the quarterly budget, will be allocated to the UGP multisig from the UNI treasury. In keeping with the committee\u2019s commitment to the community, hours and duties will be logged publicly and transparently . 2.1 Priorities Initially, the program aims to start narrow in scope, funding peripheral ecosystem initiatives, such as targeted bounties, hackathon sponsorships, and other low-stakes means of building out the Uniswap developer ecosystem. Over time, if the program proves effective, the grant allocations can grow in scope to include, for example, improved frontends, trading interfaces, and eventually, core protocol development. 1336\u00d7424 14.6 KB With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for quick successes might look like:  Total number of projects funded Quarterly increase in applications Project engagement post-event/funding Overall community engagement/sentiment  2.2 Timeline In keeping with the fast pace of the UNI ecosystem, we organize time in epochs, or two calendar quarters. Each epoch will see two funding rounds, one per quarter, after which the community can review and create proposals to improve or revamp the program as they deem fit. 1600\u00d7630 108 KB Rolling Wave 1 & 2 Applications   Starting in Q1 2021, UGP will start accepting applications for events looking for support in the form of bounties or prizes that in parallel can be proactively sourced. During these first two waves of funding projects, the allocation committee lead can begin laying out guardrails for continued funding   Considering the immediate feedback loops for the first epoch, we expect these allocation decisions to be discussed and reviewed by the larger community. Should this not be of value, the community can submit a formal governance proposal to change any piece of UGP that was not effective   Wave 3 & Beyond   Beginning with Wave 3, there should have been enough time with impactful projects funded to be considered for follow-on funding, should it make sense. In the same vein, projects within scope will be expanded to also include those working on integrations and and other key components.   Beyond the second epoch, as the community helps to review and help adapt UGP to be most effective, the scope will continue to grow in order to accommodate the state of the ecosystem including that of core protocol improvements   Conclusion: If this proposal is successfully approved, UGP will start accepting applications on a rolling basis beginning at the start of 2021. With the phases and priorities laid out above, UGP will aim to make a significant impact by catalyzing growth and innovation in the UNI ecosystem. This program is meant to be the simplest possible MVP of a Uniswap Ecosystem Grants initiative. While the multi-sig committee comes with trust assumptions about the members, our hope is the community will approve this limited engagement to get the ball rolling in an efficient structure. After the first epoch (2 fiscal quarters) the burden of proof will be on UGP to show empirical evidence that the program is worth continuing in its existing form and will submit to governance to renew treasury funding. If this program proves successful, we hope it will inspire others to follow suit and create their own funding committees for allocating treasury capital\u2014ideally with different specializations.

I also want to say that I think Ken is a great choice to lead the program. Minor points of feedback:   I\u2019d like to see the program start without a budget (i.e. be voted in conceptually before voting on the details) and have the budget be something we vote on after Ken proposes a more formal structure and process for how he\u2019ll be handing out grants.   I think we should denominate the pay in a stablecoin. If Ken wants to convert that to UNI that\u2019s great, but I\u2019ve seen this go wrong too many times to think that payment in a volatile currency is a good idea   More of a question than feedback - is this a \u201cTemperature Check\u201d?   Finally, if the final Reviewer spot is still available I\u2019d like to volunteer  ",

As crypto communities mature, the use of grants to fund specific projects desired by the product team, community, and users have the most mutually beneficial results. I would love to see an open list of project ideas (maybe some already exist in github issues or could be surfaced from frequent support requests) that people from the community could propose to take on as a part of the grants program. Of course keeping part of the funds available for organic ideas and proposals as individuals and small teams would also make sense. I\u2019m cool with the proposed reviewers given they agree to this position. I will say that it would be nice to see more reviewers that come up organically through this forum or from the discord, as it seems like a lot of these crypto projects end up with the \u201cusual suspects\u201d as having power in communities, just because they have power in other communities.

What if we add a bonus on top of the grants the Committee distributes? The idea is to make Uniswap a more attractive platform to build on than other options developers have. Also, it would serve the distribution purpose well. Presuming that developers would need to spend the grants to fund their efforts, it would be good if they had some UNI they wouldn\u2019t need to spend. This way, we could distribute more voting power towards contributors, which would be beneficial for Uniswap Governance.    Do you think adding a bonus is a good idea?  Yes No Neutral Not Sure     0 voters        What do you think would be the right bonus percentage?  0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200%     0 voters     ",

I think we should denominate the pay in a stablecoin. If Ken wants to convert that to UNI that\u2019s great, but I\u2019ve seen this go wrong too many times to think that payment in a volatile currency is a good idea    These are both great points!  With the program design, we had decided on a budget simply to set a ceiling with a narrow scope so as to get the ball rolling. The goal here is less about creating the best possible program (we know that\u2019s impossible right now!), instead it\u2019s to prove out that this is a method that can work effectively, especially as it expands. Everything is completely open and whatever doesn\u2019t get used gets returned to the treasury but we want to be clear we absolutely encourage others to propose programs that better fit those specific needs. The compensation and grantee treasury in general are really interesting points to note, just based on what I\u2019ve seen with grants in general. I am still working on the Ecosystem Support Program at the EF, but Greg is right, we have seen many grantees/teams struggle with treasury management, especially during market downturns. On the flipside, it\u2019s worked out really well for some other teams! It\u2019s an extremely important discussion to be having, but unfortunately I just don\u2019t have great advice on how grantees should best manage their funds.      zerocool:  I will say that it would be nice to see more reviewers that come up organically through this forum or from the discord, as it seems like a lot of these crypto projects end up with the \u201cusual suspects\u201d as having power in communities, just because they have power in other communities.   Absolutely agreed here. As mentioned above, in the short term we just want to ensure the foundations for the program are well established, but ultimately the goal is to empower a diverse group of community members to steer this program.

At some level, inaction is still an experiment in it\u2019s own. A stagnant treasury may or may not do something, but we just don\u2019t know yet! The silver lining here is that this proposal is a commitment to attempt to empower the larger community, but if it\u2019s not productive, the funds are returned!     g_dip:  Uniswap needs more distribution, not UNI. I.e. the DEX needs more integrations and developer tooling to increase volumes.   +100 on this! The goal is to make sure we can grow and empower the community sustainably. It won\u2019t be revolutionary overnight, but will require more mindful prioritization to identify what\u2019s impactful for Uniswap and its participants. Consequently, one huge update, Ashleigh Schap has agreed to join the allocation committee as our fifth member! With the committee now filled, we\u2019ve identified some more clarifications on what is necessary for setting up the program and have created an autonomous proposal contract to formally propose UGP. Updates as follows:  At the time of writing the contract, the price of UNI was $3, and thus if passed, the treasury will allocate 519,500 UNI. Just to call this out explicitly, all amounts from the proposal are caps to which we will not exceed and any excess UNI remaining at the end of the epoch will be returned to treasury. Based on some preliminary gut checks, we want to budget 10% of the UNI allocation for administrative, setup, and legal fees to ensure that this first iteration can establish best practices which will be completely open for anyone else to adopt.  450,000 UNI for UGP allocations 50,000 UNI for setup budget 19,500 for compensation    To support the proposal going up for quorum, please delegate your votes to the APC address at 0x76f54Eeb0D33a2A2c5CCb72FE12542A56f35d67C!

(See: https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/grants-administrator-salary/new-york-ny) Perhaps there are special qualifications / considerations to justify this rate, but I would like more detail. Partly, my concern stems from his co-authorship of the proposal. To be clear, I\u2019m not familiar with Ken, personally, and my question should in no way be construed as a lack of confidence in his leadership of the committee or the merits of the concept generally. But as a \u201cpoint of order\u201d (if you will), it does seem at least worth a moment\u2019s pause when a proposal directly benefits its (co-)author, although \u2013 credit where it\u2019s due \u2013 this was clearly disclosed.

At max cap of 30 hrs / week that\u2019s ~$12,000 per month or $144,000 / year   Thanks for bringing this up! I did help co-author this post, but generally just to help provide input in shaping the proposal to represent more precisely what the grants program will/would look like eg. narrow scope, committee-run, budgets and spending caps. Just a couple points on the compensation:  I\u2019ve worked in nonprofit and biomedical research for a few years so I\u2019m quite familiar with grantmaking and the salaries that come with it  although I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s been different in mostly tech fields. Looking at models like DARPA and other more niche programs, this salary is well within reason Separately, this is a consultant rate, instead of salaried compensation (so no benefits package like healthcare or tax coverage the way a company would), where rates are generally higher to cover taxes As the program starts to take shape, we might see that 30 hours is too much when it comes to vetting applications, which is why 30 hours is the max cap. At least for this proposal, we should be looking to establish best practices and a good precedent for the future  Hope this answers your questions! ",
