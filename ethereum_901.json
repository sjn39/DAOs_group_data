During yesterday\u2019s council, @boris proposed that ethereum magicians resources could be used to help potential participants find/share accommodation in Osaka. I\u2019m sure he will be able to tell everyone a bit more about what he really meant (I\u2019m really uncomfortable speaking in someone else\u2019s name). So if:  you want to look for roommates with magicians powers (or crypto kitties, which are the best kind of kitty since they don\u2019t have to go through quarantine) \u2192 Use this thread If you need financial help from the community to attend the council \u2192 Use this thread If you want to discuss anything about attending the council \u2192 Use this thread  For the council organisation, follow the link to my previous thread (at the top of this unnecessarily long message) ",
