Please comment below about best practices for tags (this is also opened up as a wiki post). Here are my thoughts:   How tags fit in:  Let\u2019s keep using categories, and use tags for interesting sub-categories, cross-referencing, and commentary.    Main conventions:  Use singular tags where possible Keep them lower-cased Dashes replace spaces, within reason (favoring readability)    When referencing an EIP category, use the following conventions:  \u201ccore-eip\u201d for Core EIPs, \u201cmeta-eip\u201d for Meta EIPs, etc. \u201ceip-1066\u201d for a specific EIP    When referencing another category, use the following conventions:  \u201cxyz-ring\u201d for XYZ Ring \u201ceip-last-call\u201d for the \u201cEIPs: Last Call\u201d subcategory, etc    Humor is fine, within reason.

Also, EIPs/ERCs directly \u2014 eg #erc1066 Events - #councilofberlin #devcon4 BTW \u2014 as a user, you can subscribe / watch tags in the same as top level categories.
