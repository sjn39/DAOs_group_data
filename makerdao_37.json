Announcements This is the first week DAI was distributed based on the new payout formula proposed last week in  Changes to our Implementation of SourceCred. See the Cred Stats section below for analysis of how the change affected this week\u2019s payouts. A new feature, developed in collaboration with the SourceCred working group, is currently being tested! For a sneak preview, checkout the lastest Community Call, where the SourceCred dev responsible for building the feature (@topocount), presents an overview, and the community asks some great questions.      The SourceCred working group is currently exploring how this feature can be used, and aims to have a post up soon detailing the feature and proposing changes to Maker\u2019s instance. Payouts This week $5,000 worth of DAI was distributed based on Cred scores. Navigate to the DAI Accounts tab  of the Maker instance to see your current DAI balance and total DAI earned.

A handful of times since we started, I\u2019ve noted similar dips, and wondered if we were going down  But if you zoom out, every time it\u2019s just kept going up. I don\u2019t think we should rest on our laurels, but the uptrend may resume     image778\u00d7499 81.4 KB   Competition? There\u2019s an explosion of DAOs now. Flipping jpegs of rocks for millions of dollars is fun  Maker also has a lot of prestige. Working here can increase your options, and lots of DeFi money is chasing a small talent pool, as has been discussed in the comp threads. Environment? DAOs can be pretty combative and adversarial at times. Which can over time lead people to collaborate more in private channels. CU contributors may just be naturally finding the best way to work. Also, some coming from more corporate backgrounds may find a more decentralized environment doesn\u2019t work for them. I think Maker is generally benefitting from its relatively professional and civil culture, strong moderation. But even the best DAOs can be traumatizing at times. Still lots of unsolved problems.  Again, pure speculation. Curious to hear any ideas you might have Saludiego. May even be able to check it against Cred data. ",

E.g. A new MIP, a new suggested process, a new piece of software, an enhancement to any of the existing  Focus on building/improving together.  While a forum post on a new initiative usually either attracts ovation or criticism, it is much harder to measure true willingness of parties interacting to help each other by improving the underlying together. Whereas, in github at least the parties can play a more \u201cactive\u201d role by submitting an issue or raising a new PR, which demonstrates that aim of actually giving constructive input (sender) and willingness to focus on improvement (receiver).  Focus on strategic aims rather than tactic gains. It\u2019s fairly difficult to connect the dots between the various initiatives of teams across forum posts. Whereas the \u201chistorical\u201d aspect of git gives an insight into how \u201cdeep and meaningful\u201d initiatives evolve through time and how much hands-on contribution and collaboration they really rally around.

If you were one of the 43 people below the 20 DAI limit this month, we are holding onto your DAI for you (Maker sent us the full 5k DAI/week per usual).

There are a few ways to approach this: SourceCred instances So SourceCred is working on automated payouts in instances generally. The will require a robust identity management system based on a native identity/address store. We working on this now, but the devs tell me it\u2019s a big job, and may be several months away from completion. Manual distribution One can always manually distribute on-chain weekly rather than monthly. We haven\u2019t done this so far, because a) we\u2019re still getting paid monthly by Maker, b) our internal process is still fairly manual and cumbersome, and c) gas prices. Streaming payments Per the SourceCred Funding MIP, the goal is to pay contributors directly from the protocol. It would be amazing to have streaming payments via the Keg ( @prose11). Theoretically, SourceCred could submit weekly requests to the keg module, updating the flight (list of addresses) and rate (amount distributed). Gas is then no longer SourceCred\u2019s problem, as contributors pay gas themselves when they withdrawal their DAI to their wallet. I\u2019ve been hesitant to engage with this process, as I know Maker governance is very busy getting the first basic Core Units online, and that process may change in flight as kinks are worked out. But any ideas here are welcome! ",

I think doubling rewards would onboard more of these kinds of users and encourage high-quality engagement.   I\u2019ve been pretty impressed. One potential variable in the context of SourceCred is that @Elihu has been reaching out to new contributors here and on r/makerdao who show promise and encouraging them to opt in.

This is my personal lower limit on any transactions I make on the blockchain - but that is of course just me!   I think this is likely a bit high for some people. I think something like 20 DAI would be better. For people with lower means, but also (more importantly) new contributors. It takes considerable effort to get enough likes to reach 10 DAI, and getting that first on-chain payout for your work can help engagement/recruitment. Some estimates below  Open to pushback/other suggestions.     ianaz:  I agree on raising it a bit. Looks like txs are batched so fees aren\u2019t that astronomical; 86 people have been paid by this transaction  (~0.81$/each in fees).   This month the gas was very low. But it\u2019s been much higher in recent months. Last month was more typical (payouts tx), costing $196, or $2.23 per contributor. If we apply a 20 DAI minimum, gas fees would be $139.5, saving $56.5.     alexis:  I don\u2019t think that really matter, it should be managed by the CU. This is micro management. Don\u2019t need to involve a governance vote for that. The end result will be voted by governance, it will be cut the budget or not.   Much appreciate this sentiment. In this case, it doesn\u2019t feel like micromanagement, because the change is trivial to implement, and the end goal is the community managing the instance. But the community weighing in on every decision isn\u2019t sustainable. Still figuring out that balance as we go. ",

For details on opting in, see Opting in to Sourcecred/Wth is SourceCred?. Announcements In this distribution, SourceCred funding has officially transitioned to the new tithing model. Previously,  SourceCred (the project), was receiving a 5,000 DAI/month dev grant from the Foundation for support and new feature development. With the sunsetting of this program in March as part of the DAO\u2019s decentralization, the GovAlpha Core Unit (CU) has taken over paying for SourceCred. As part of this transition, SourceCred proposed (and GovAlpha agreed to) switching from the flat 5,000 DAI/month amount to SourceCred\u2019s preferred tithing model (used by SoureCred\u2019s other partner communities), whereby SourceCred receives 5% of the total Cred generated while the tithe is active. In addition, I (@s_ben) will be paid 2,000 DAI/month to continue providing priority support for Maker\u2019s instance, as well as opting myself into payouts, as is standard practice in SourceCred\u2019s other partner communities. At current distribution levels (~20k DAI/mo), this means Maker will be paying roughly ~2,500 DAI less per month than under the previous arrangement. If distribution were doubled, as proposed in a recent informal poll (worth a read!),  from 20k to ~40k DAI/month, SourceCred\u2019s tithe would equal ~2k DAI/mo, and total costs would likely be around 4.5-5k DAI/mo. We believe this aligns incentives well, as increased payouts increases the risk of gaming and other support costs. However, this is open to renegotiation as we forge into new territory. On a personal note, I requested to be opted into payouts so I would be incentivized to contribute here more. I\u2019d like to post more on issues related to SourceCred, as well as decentralized governance, etc., and opting in alleviates the opportunity costs.  WARNING:  Cred scores and payouts may see volatility in the coming weeks and months as we tweak the algorithm and payout parameters. We still have a lot of work to do before the system is optimized enough to \u201cossify\u201d, producing predictable payouts. Hint: it may be changing soon;) Payouts This week $5,000 worth of DAI was distributed to 91 contributors.

AstronautThis:  I agree with the decision itself but wasn\u2019t sure what process was followed to permit GovAlpha to approve this.   Mostly just that SourceCred is something that myself and a few others have been administering for some time. Currently SourceCred is being paid out of the GovAlpha budget because everything is still more or less manually operated. While we do intend to run any major changes in direction by the community in the form of polls, I don\u2019t believe these changes really warrant that. The described changes in payment structure equate to more or less what we were paying SourceCred + Seth previously, it\u2019s more that we\u2019ve just transitioned it away from the Foundation and into GovAlpha. The tithe does represent a small decrease in total distribution though, so we may consider increasing the total output some in the future. The end goal with Sourcecred is to get it setup such that governance can vote on certain parameters directly (amount of funding, tithe %, potentially instance parameters and that these are enforced on-chain) at that point any change would require the usual governance processes. In the meantime though, it\u2019s dependent on the GovAlpha budget which means that by default we\u2019re managing it. If Governance want to take a greater role in managing SourceCred, that\u2019s very doable. If not, GovAlpha is happy to manage such that it doesn\u2019t draw focus away from more important stuff like core unit budgets, collateral onboarding and general Maker-related things. ",

Right now everyone generates Cred, and then 5k Dai () is distributed based on a percentage (). So if we were to double our user base (ceteris paribus), you would get half the Dai if your activity was the same. This means that, based on the current incentives model, you should not invite people to join and contribute (since that would be reducing your portion of the total pie). (Most people would argue that most people don\u2019t do this for the Dai that is received, so this is not a problem). My proposal is to give away cake based on absolute terms. 1 Cred = 1 Dai, since it seems that we\u2019re at parity and people are OK with it.

Lol, a good governance facilitator knows how to minimize friction      juan:  Reason for: the Dai given away would not be a zero-sum game (more people in the pool decrease your gains), and will be related to the actual week-to-week participation.   While i\u2019m not feeling zero-sum vibes, maybe others are? I\u2019ve actually been a proponent of pegging Cred to Grain (DAI in Maker\u2019s case) for a long time. The main concerns people have raised against this in the past:   Cred inflation: Cred is minted on likes. Pegging 1 Cred = 1 DAI essentially gives people the ability to print DAI with likes (this is already kinda the way it works as likes mint Cred, but with a fixed DAI supply you\u2019re not creating new DAI, just shifting where it goes). I.e. Cred printer go brrr\u2026  Budgeting: As you note, Cred could grow significantly. Even if MKR holders see SourceCred as valuable and want to raise payouts, budgeting is still tricky. SourceCred is currently funded through the GovAlpha budget, which is voted on by MKR holders every 3 months. In the last three months, Cred has increased from roughly 2,000 Cred/week to 5,000, a ~250% increase. In fact, Cred appears to be exponentially increasing?  image1568\u00d71108 118 KB   This is just me eyeballing, not a statistical analysis, but if this trend continues, it could be hard not to go over budget (or tie up idle capital over shooting). Side note: shoutout (and a little extra Cred) to @Planet_X, who predicted Maker\u2019s governance overhead was growing exponentially back in Jan 2020.    As for precedent in other communities, I\u2019m not aware of a 1 Cred = 1 token peg in the wild (doesn\u2019t mean it don\u2019t exist). Though the communities I\u2019m thinking about also pay out floating price tokens, not stablecoins\u2026 They typically distribute fixed amounts, but adjust periodically, as Maker is doing. Another lever we have available is the \u2018cred budgets\u2019 feature. It allows you to specify how much Cred is generated in a given week. That could be used to create a ceiling. If Cred goes beyond the limit, likes still count, but dilute the DAI/Cred rate overall. Additionally, I\u2019ve been working with GovAlpha on a feature that should allow us to more specifically target Cred flows, which would increase my personal comfort level with recommending increased payouts generally.  image537\u00d7539 57 KB  If with all that info you still feel strongly about a 1-to-1 peg juanuan, I\u2019m happy to pursue this thread further. Also, for the community at large, Is anyone feeling a zero-sum dynamic that is inhibiting them from inviting people, liking, or other behavior? ",

But it seems you\u2019re looking for Cred over time, with the ability to weight total Cred by time. We can see this indirectly already in the payout formula. Currently, 75% of DAI is distributed based on the \"Recent\u2019 policy, which weights contributions using an exponential decay, as illustrated below. Maker is currently using a decay rate of 0.4.  1190\u00d7944 84.6 KB  If you want to do your own analysis though, here\u2019s a csv  with raw week-by-week Cred data. This should allow you to apply your own decay functions if you like. Note: this is data from a test instance that uses a newer version of SourceCred than Maker has in prod, but the scores should be roughly the same as the live data. The UI for the new version (comming soon) also shows Cred rankings by this week, last week, this month, and all time, which may be helpful. Here\u2019s a hosted test instance that has those views.
