                    "content": "Some might say we are short term focused and prone to micro-management. A previous post explored what MakerDAO can be in 5 years (without getting a clear view at the end). This post focus on the mission and objectives we can collectively decide for 2021. Here, I define a mission as a short sentence that should be used as a red wire in almost all we do, how we should define MakerDAO in 1-3 years. The idea is to pick one in the end even if we can agree with many. Let\u2019s define objective as a big chunk of work we want to be done around the end of 2021. We can have as many objectives as we think we can achieve. They should be open but still with a descriptive part. This post is only for brainstorming, so we can propose anything, discuss anything and we will poll next year when the thing settle if there is enough traction. Maybe discussing the mission is more interesting, maybe starting with objectives makes more sense (quite sure there is a loop). I let you decide. The following of the post will be updated with your addition/comments. Mission list Maker the CryptoBank corporation Be the biggest bank amongst DeFi and CeFi thanks to a first-class workforce and governance. Banks being defined as what a bank means in the future. Expanding the competitive landscape to CeFi (Square is next on the list, then HSBC and BoA). Put an emphasis on the importance of the workforce (paying our teams with the protocol money, being the best place to work) and the governance community. Maker Autonomous Protocol Be the leader in stablecoin lending and provide a good return to MKR holders This is a narrower mission and it avoids pushing the scope too far and over-investing to remunerate the MKR token holders. One target is to have the least human interaction in the day to day activity. So most likely a small or no dedicated workforce and low governance overhead. Maker The Money Lego Be the key building block in DeFi and change the world Support all the DeFi by having the best permissionless, trustless system. Be at the bottom on the Protocol Sink Thesis. Put an emphasis on the protocol versus front-end for instance. Also, need a lot of interaction with other protocols to collectively create the best possible version of DeFi. Maker Making the World a better Place Banking the Unbanked Put an emphasis on the retail market, marketing, and the front-end. Leverage the work done by the Foundation in Latam and elsewhere. Objectives list Sustain a workforce Attract, nurture, and retain a sizable workforce. See [Discussion] MakerDAO Contributors compensation brainstorm, [Discussion/Request] DAO's Organigram, and probably other discussions. Target full autonomy from the Maker structure (i.e. all facilitators and domain paid by the protocol). Create EUR-DAI Expanding from the DAI success, we will launch a Euro (or another currency, just for illustration here). It will be an independent copy/paste of the current DAI credit system (but all based on MKR at the end). Depeg from USD In order to avoid regulation issues, a new version of DAI will be launched (on the side) not related to any currency (maybe something inflation-linked). In case of a regulatory issue, we would depreciate the $-based DAI. Launch Real World Assets Target $300M RWA loans for the end of 2021. Limit stablecoin exposure The stablecoin exposure is around $500M at the end of 2020. It should be significantly lower (< $100M) at the end of 2021. The main solution is to add new collaterals but reducing SF or any other solution might be needed as well. cUSDC-type vaults are considered as stablecoin exposure. Third-party protocol specific vaults Integrate with at least one third-party protocol like Yearn (like yETH, yYFI) or B-Protocol by providing them dedicated vault facilities. We can give them better risk parameters because we are confident that they will manage their position more carefully. Develop a solution to bank the unbanked with the Maker ecosystem Open to suggestions on this one by basically expanding on this post. Maybe having > xM users in LATAM at the end of 2021? Use MakerDAO balance sheet to generate revenues other than stability fees Basically, MIP32: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure. Can also link to Balance sheet manipulation: How to yield farm safely on Uniswap and MIP31: Active Reserve Via AMM. Objective: generates more than $10M of revenues on an annual basis from such channels. Layer 2 solution (including other chains) xDAI or something else. Autonomous or just a L1-L2 bridge. More info on Ethereum L1 Gas Issue for little Dai holders/investors (ES/EN/PT) Own and manage Maker assets More or less take ownership of makerdao.com and establish a MakerDAO brand on it. Currently, things are confusing. That would also mean paying a team to manage that. Improve protocol functionalities We should keep up with the competency. There is a lot we can do in this regard, adding Flash Mint module, we could use it to improve our internal functionalities, permitting things like Collateral Swap for the Vaults (integrating properly with Uniswap), Special features for MKR holders i.e. special lending feature for them, permit to borrow from special reserves, anything which makes holding MKR something with greater benefits Governance by \u201cpolitical parties\u201d Delegated voting to bridge the discussion between the governance forum and the MKR whales. Decentralize MakerDAO Having MKR_t token/DAO for each collateral and automate the DAI_t <=> DAI convertibility if some solvency rules on this MKR_t DAO are satisfied. See more here. Partners support The value of DAI depends on having a whole ecosystem using it. Foster \u201cInternal Incubators\u201d  encourage our world-class people to build things using our Credit System: what better way to harvest intelligence than to make your people use your product, love it and have \u201cskin in the game\u201d to improve it? (as old as Ford selling cars to his employees) Plus, with a truly global workforce, you could make Maker/DAI truly global. Make Maker/DAI explainable to 5 year olds With global communication, ideas spread fast. Simple ideas spread faster! If we want DAI in Latam, Africa and everywhere else, we should make it the most simple and powerful idea ever  Implement mechanisms to keep us opened to new DEFI users This has become IMO a very important objective given what has been discussed in Signal Request to Increase the Dust Minimum. We could start with simple proposals like Creating a Bite-Rebate Contract for Keepers Acting on Small Vaults ",

From the Mission List: Personally I\u2019m not too crazy about the label \u201cCryptoBank\u201d \u2013 would prefer anything without the \u201cbank\u201d in it. Just makes me feel like we need to be Regulated like banks by the Federal Reserve System and others. Maybe I\u2019m overthinking it. Also, not feeling the \u201cMaker The Money Lego\u201d theme. IMO, if it will be know by mainstream people as \"Money Legos\u2019, let it happen without Maker pushing the narrative. If Money Legos fall, don\u2019t let it include the Maker Community as one that label itself as proponent, or opponent of such, IMO. Otherwise, totally loving the Maker Autonomous Protocol and Maker Making the World a better Place Missions. From the Objectives List: I\u2019m with you on all the objectives, except Depeg from the USD. This Holiday weekend I tried to showcase Ethereum to one of my cousins by placing a Sports Bet via the Degens App. After showing them how to install Metamask and loading some ETH and DAI to place the bet, I had to explain why the ETH Gas fee was $16 for a $100 bet. My cousin, said \u201cI thought the idea of decentralization was to cut the \u201cmiddle man\u201d out.\u201d Followed by \u201cI guess at the end of the day, everything in life is All about the Dollars\u201d. Which makes me realized that we are mentally all PEGGED to the U.S. Dollar. That will not change in our lifetime. Maybe in our great great grandkids life, but not right now.

Not in the short term, but we should start getting prepared to be regulated, and that means, to structure the DAO more similar to a big corporation. All the other missions are something we can accomplish within this one. Objectives  Sustain a workforce Launch Real World Assets Limit stablecoin exposure  Would like to express this in a different way, we should reduce \u201cdirect exposure\u201d, but it is valid to increase (IMHO) exposure to stablecoins if they are \u201cwrapped\u201d, specially by liquidity provider pools (ie. yCRV, curve 3pool, UNI-V2-USDC-USDT and similar pools.

Really think I should have added a section regarding regulation. What we see for Maker in the future probably depends on our perception of the regulation. ",

Liquidity Providers earn fee giving their funds to these pools (in Curve, Balance, Uniswap, \u2026). They receive the UNI-V2-token, yCRV and others which represents their ownership of a percent of that pool. Leveraging being a liquidity provider or being able in general to be in those pools and still be able to get DAIs to make other things is a dream many liquidity providers probably share. This says that we have a secured market here which will be willing to get DAI from us, and we\u2019re talking of a huge one! Now, we are against holding centralized stablecoins specially due to the possibility of they black-listing our contracts. But delegating that risk to the pools, makes it (IMO) far less probable that holding the USDC-USDT-TUSD ourselves (a government will have to order to block whole a huge pool, and even several stablecoins inside that pool; and in the years to come, these pools will grow bigger and bigger, I\u2019m pretty sure of that, if we don\u2019t offer those leverage opportunity with DAI, someone else will do it and those pools after that will 2x - 5x rapidly). Therefore reducing our exposure to USDC directly (or USDT, or others) is fine and a must do, but we should keep us open to something more interesting based in stablecoins, and I see that in the liquidity pools. (in the future, yASSETS, fASSETS and similar, based in stablecoins are going to be the same or more valuables I think) ",

The idea is to pick one in the end even if we can agree with many   I think this is an excellent way to keep focus for 2021. I think it is still difficult to narrow in on one idea as such a large group, but for me the clear winner would be:     SebVentures:  Maker Making the World a better Place Banking the Unbanked Put an emphasis on the retail market, marketing, and the front-end. Leverage the work done by the Foundation in Latam and elsewhere.   For me, this is the lightbulb that brought me into Maker. A platform that was truly empowering. The Oasis Platform doesn\u2019t care who you are or where you come from, or even what you plan to do with the loan. It\u2019s all about allowing anyone to leverage there assets for any purpose they see fit. I was brought into the wonderful world of Maker because I wanted to sound the alarm about the Dust limit being raised to 500 DAI (thanks for the link too @SebVentures) and ended up finding a wonderful, supportive community that would actually listen to complaints and counter points of view. Granted with the gas prices and ETH/USD being so high, micro loans are far less possible than they were even a month ago, but I think that\u2019s an excellent place to start. As far as objectives, I think the following is rather doable:     SebVentures:  Launch Real World Assets Target $300M RWA loans for the end of 2021.   Our partners are very eager and it seems like we have the back end work ready to get things moving in January.     SebVentures:  Sustain a workforce Attract, nurture, and retain a sizable workforce. See [Discussion] MakerDAO Contributors compensation brainstorm, [Discussion/Request] DAO\u2019s Organigram, and probably other discussions. Target full autonomy from the Maker structure (i.e. all facilitators and domain paid by the protocol).   I think this will have to happen this year, whether we are ready for it or not. The countdown is ticking as the Maker Foundation prepares to hand over the keys and this should absolutely  be a top priority.     SebVentures:  Develop a solution to bank the unbanked with the Maker ecosystem Open to suggestions on this one by basically expanding on this post . Maybe having > xM users in LATAM at the end of 2021?   As suggested in my pick for 2021 Mission, I think this is incredibly important to the future of not just Maker, but the entire world. Our DAO is only as strong as the people we attract, and proving that we are dedicated to making this a system anyone can participate in, from the Oasis Platform all the way thought Governance is the way to do so IMO. I believe all this could be done in 2021, while still working on some of the other great ideas above. But b setting our priorities I think we will get much more accomplished and we do need to step back and appreciate the scope of all we are trying to do. ",

Banks being defined as what a bank means in the future. Expanding the competitive landscape to CeFi (Square is next on the list, then HSBC and BoA). Put an emphasis on the importance of the workforce (paying our teams with the protocol money, being the best place to work) and the governance community.   Yes (I pick this one, still I comment below in each of them) we are definitely going that way, in order to do that there needs to be further discussion in respect to regulatory compliance, this is not going to be the wild west forever and pretending to onboard real world assets without any sort of regulation in the horizon is like covering the sun with one hand, you can do it but it doesn\u00b4t stop it from shining. In that respect and moving forward in the rest of the items we should put the house in order before, what do I mean by that? The success of failure of maker is ultimately going to depend on the people putting in the muscle, ideas like FlapperDistributor: A Way to Distribute System Surplus while Minimizing Governance should be moved in front of the agenda, now we need to pay audits for increasing the LP debt ceiling for example, we need to streamline the process and onboard the best and brightest at competitive rates because that\u00b4s what\u00b4s going to make the difference in the ROI, the scalability of the workforce and inside organization.Thing like delegated voting are definitely going to bring the maker dao a more executive approach in 2021.     SebVentures:  Maker Autonomous Protocol Be the leader in stablecoin lending and provide a good return to MKR holders This is a narrower mission and it avoids pushing the scope too far and over-investing to remunerate the MKR token holders. One target is to have the least human interaction in the day to day activity. So most likely a small or no dedicated workforce and low governance overhead.   I\u00b4d gladly renounce to the voting rewards if they were destinted to hire more devs, hiring per se isn\u00b4t going to do anything without internal organization (not always two people in the kitchen deliver the best meal)     SebVentures:  Maker The Money Lego Be the key building block in DeFi and change the world Support all the DeFi by having the best permissionless, trustless system. Be at the bottom on the Protocol Sink Thesis . Put an emphasis on the protocol versus front-end for instance. Also, need a lot of interaction with other protocols to collectively create the best possible version of DeFi.   Yes and yes, something happened through 2020 that seems we got distant to other protocols, we need to create alliances and work together like we are currently doing with yearn. Perhaps it was the foundation stepping back and the lack of leadership (who is accountable for proper communication of decisions?) this will also be partially solved with delegated voting.     SebVentures:  Maker Making the World a better Place Banking the Unbanked Put an emphasis on the retail market, marketing, and the front-end. Leverage the work done by the Foundation in Latam and elsewhere.   I like the idea, however as we currently stand with a 500 dai minimum dust it\u00b4s going to be an issue, we need to enphasize on integrations, no work from our end has been done there, glad the foundation is putting in the muscle. One objective that is missing is layer 2 solutions, if we don\u00b4t move we may get left behind as a retail bank for RWA loans for corporations instead of \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d     SebVentures:  Objectives list Sustain a workforce Attract, nurture, and retain a sizable workforce. See [Discussion] MakerDAO Contributors compensation brainstorm, [Discussion/Request] DAO\u2019s Organigram, and probably other discussions. Target full autonomy from the Maker structure (i.e. all facilitators and domain paid by the protocol).   Agreed and critical dare I say, we are going to be left behind if not. Just to clarify this does not mean that we are doing things the wrong way, it just catches us on a cross road that other projects do not face. Yearn did it instantly, while other \u201cDAO\u201d have marginal repercusion on anything aside from voting, all development or most is done with the companies that funded the project, what we are facing now is what likely many will face later.     SebVentures:  Create EUR-DAI Expanding from the DAI success, we will launch a Euro (or another currency, just for illustration here). It will be an independent copy/paste of the current DAI credit system (but all based on MKR at the end).   Agreed, again there is no team of legal background, would be good to onboard one to see in which battles are we getting in blind folded     SebVentures:  Depeg from USD In order to avoid regulation issues, a new version of DAI will be launched (on the side) not related to any currency (maybe something inflation-linked). In case of a regulatory issue, we would depreciate the $-based DAI.   I like the concept, however we have an issue, first there needs to be a market fit for the product, is there demand for it? Secondly how would the oracles work? Thirdly if there were to be demand it\u00b4s a niche savings account instead of trading, investments, consuming product dai is. Who would deposit a collateral, mint an index and keep it and pay an interest above it? The idea doesn\u00b4t click me from a practical standpoint. Different is if you deposit dai and extract a syntethic representation of a token, that I like but doesn\u00b4t solve regulations.     SebVentures:  Launch Real World Assets Target $300M RWA loans for the end of 2021.   Agreed, I would also include a target for LP tokens, 300 seems plausible if not more.     SebVentures:  Limit stablecoin exposure The stablecoin exposure is around $500M at the end of 2020. It should be significantly lower (< $100M) at the end of 2021. The main solution is to add new collaterals but reducing SF or any other solution might be needed as well. cUSDC-type vaults are considered as stablecoin exposure.   Not sure about that, this is taking into account current market, it may very well increase in the future (hope I\u00b4m wrong)  cUSD is a different animal, there we would be facing a substantial increase in revenue to mitigate risk, not entirely uncomfortable there, also presumming dai outstanding increases (let\u00b4s target 5 billion) the weight of stablecoins would decrease     SebVentures:  Third-party protocol specific vaults Integrate with at least one third-party protocol like Yearn (like yETH, yYFI) or B-Protocol  by providing them dedicated vault facilities. We can give them better risk parameters because we are confident that they will manage their position more carefully.   Yes     SebVentures:  Develop a solution to bank the unbanked with the Maker ecosystem Open to suggestions on this one by basically expanding on this post . Maybe having > xM users in LATAM at the end of 2021?   Again the dust limits and gas costs to open a vault make it a fairy tale to bank the unbanked currently, dai usage is different though     SebVentures:  Use MakerDAO balance sheet to generate revenues other than stability fees Basically, MIP32: Peg Stability Module - Compound Mixed Exposure. Can also link to Balance sheet manipulation: How to yield farm safely on Uniswap and MIP31: Active Reserve Via AMM. Objective: generates more than $10M of revenues on an annual basis from such channels.   Don\u00b4t sell yourself short! Definitely yes, we have 4m in the SB that could already be generating 600k at USDC-DAI in uniswap     SebVentures:  Layer 2 solution (including other chains) xDAI or something else . Autonomous or just a L1-L2 bridge. More info on Ethereum L1 Gas Issue for little Dai holders/investors (ES/EN/PT)   Yes     SebVentures:  Own and manage Maker assets More or less take ownership of makerdao.com and establish a MakerDAO brand on it. Currently, things are confusing. That would also mean paying a team to manage that.   Yes     SebVentures:  Improve protocol functionalities We should keep up with the competency. There is a lot we can do in this regard, adding Flash Mint module, we could use it to improve our internal functionalities, permitting things like Collateral Swap for the Vaults (integrating properly with Uniswap),   Aave is issuing weekly revenue reports, (a one pager summary I saw on linkedin), flash loans last week generated 90k. Collateral swaps would be an interesting option to add to the menu.     SebVentures:  Special features for MKR holders i.e. special lending feature for them, permit to borrow from special reserves, anything which makes holding MKR something with greater benefits   Definitely, you can monetize eth and invest we should find a way to bring liquidity to maker token holders instead of them going to aave, we need to find a way to do it and avoid the negative feedback loop.     SebVentures:  Governance by \u201cpolitical parties\u201d Delegated voting to bridge the discussion between the governance forum and the MKR whales.   Critical In summary of all of this, the key mission and key objectives that are conditional to the development of everything else imo s to have a mechanism similar to the flapper in order to be able to onboard domain teams & pay for operational expenses needed to grow and have an operational structure and procedures (similar to MIPs but for micro in order to be able to delegate decisions for more agile responses). We will be burning a lot of cash but that is needed in order to grow as fast as we need to grow to survive. ",

Key objectives/success criteria could include providing the best rates, low gas costs for loan issuance (L2), all while using a simple and elegant user interface making it fast and easy to use. I also believe to achieve this mission, we need to continue to foster the strongest Community, and ensure that our contributors making the Project better are well compensated so economic incentives are aligned.

                    "content": "    SebVentures:  Maker the CryptoBank corporation Be the biggest bank amongst DeFi and CeFi thanks to a first-class workforce and governance.   IMO, a functional definition of a bank is: \u201can economic entity which uses short-term debt (deposits) to finance long-term assets, with an equity risk cushion to ensure the solvency and liquidity of the short-term debt\u201d. Using this definition, Maker clearly is already a bank: DAI is short-term debt with instant liquidity, the collateral are long-term assets being financed by the DAI, and the MKR token value is the equity capital at risk. Thus, I support leaning into the cryptobank narrative. Since Maker already is a bank, it should focus on that role intentionally and become a great one.      SebVentures:  Maker Autonomous Protocol Be the leader in stablecoin lending and provide a good return to MKR holders This is a narrower mission and it avoids pushing the scope too far and over-investing to remunerate the MKR token holders. One target is to have the least human interaction in the day to day activity. So most likely a small or no dedicated workforce and low governance overhead.   I am very skeptical of this narrative. If we accept that Maker is a bank, and is thus doing risk-management of long-term assets so as to ensure DAI\u2019s solvency\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to automate risk management. Managing the risk of a long-term cryptoportfolio requires a ton of intelligence and nuance, and the only way we will get that intelligence and nuance is by having a team of well-incentivized, aligned, and capable humans. If we prioritize having small/no workforce, I think that we will have to accept doing a bad job of managing Maker\u2019s risk\u2026 which is the single most important job for Maker.     SebVentures:  Sustain a workforce   Continuing the theme from above, I think this will be one of the most important tests for Maker (as for the DAO space generally). I want to note that SourceCred is actively focused on this question (how to sustain, nurture, and align a decentralized community). We don\u2019t have all the answers yet, but we\u2019re working hard on solutions. I hope that SourceCred can be an important part of the puzzle for Maker. I\u2019d like to signal boost a thread by @prose11 on the SourceCred forums exploring the issues that currently block SC from playing a bigger role in Maker compensation.     SebVentures:  Depeg from USD In order to avoid regulation issues, a new version of DAI will be launched (on the side) not related to any currency (maybe something inflation-linked). In case of a regulatory issue, we would depreciate the $-based DAI.   I support this proposal. I think there\u2019s a ton of value in a decentralized stablecoin that maintains dollar-collateral-backing but not a dollar price target. See thread I wrote on the subject. Note that if we keep running with the \u201cMaker is already a bank\u201d thesis, then we see that DAI basically represents deposits in the bank\u2013and those deposits should be earning interest. If we depeg the price from USD, causing the price to gradually float upwards, that upward price drift would represent the interest earned by depositors to the bank. (Note that economically speaking, anyone holding DAI is providing the debt capital to finance collateral assets, and thus should be compensated, regardless of whether they take an additional step of depositing it into a smart contract. Having a consistently rising price would serve this function.) I will also add my own proposal to this mix: Fractalize MakerDAO Currently, MakerDAO is a single DAO with a single pool of risk capital (MKR). However, it has a diverse set of risks in its portfolio (each collateral). The problem with pooling risks in this way is that it creates a tragedy of the commons. Any particular MKR token holder may be incentivized to approve a new, risky collateral, because that risk is socialized across all MKR token holders, but the holder may have a private gain from the new token (e.g. they are a big HODLer). The best example of this is a A simple solution is to fractalize Maker, so that each class of collateral has its own pool of risk capital. Then, anyone who wants to advocate for a new collateral would have to put skin in the game, by actually funding the risk capital pool for that collateral. If no-one is willing to fund that pool, it would be a clear sign that the collateral is too risky. From an implementation perspective, suppose that someone wants to add a new collateral type t into Maker. Rather than making the main Maker instance accept t as collateral, we would spin up a new instance, MakerDAO_t, which would have MKR_t as a risk equity pool and DAI_t as DAI backed by this particular collateral. The main Maker instance would then accept DAI_t as collateral, so long as the value of MKR_t is high enough to satisfy Maker governance\u2019s assessment of the underlying risk in t. A big advantage to this is that it would truly decentralize Maker\u2019s governance. We would switch from having a single central governance process (through which every change to any risk parameter needs to go through) to a decentralized governance process. Each collateral-scoped DAO would be responsible for local governance around its own risk management, with the meta-DAO only needing to assess the reliability of the collateral-scoped DAO, rather than dive into the nuances of the asset. Also, if someone wanted to onboard a new collateral type, they could go out and raise that risk capital directly, rather than needing to lobby the core Maker protocol to approve all of the risk. ",

I understand the view, but I\u2019m not sure this is an inspiring mission. The autonomy is effective since December 28th 2020 with the PSM executive. I\u2019m quite sure the Foundation didn\u2019t vote for this executive so this shows that the Foundation no longer controls MakerDAO destiny from a voting power point of view. When was the last time you heard of the Foundation? Last time I remember was in July (saying they will no longer work on the PSM). We are generating $21M of yearly revenues which is probably more than the Foundation. For the workforce, as we don\u2019t know how to pay people yet, it\u2019s difficult to hire people (maybe the ones from the Foundation). But this is a very minor detail. Because I\u2019m quite interested to be paid, I will make a proposal soon (most likely this week) and a more serious MIP seems in process. Both Yearn, Yam and others have solved that in a matter of weeks. Having a strategy is also a way to unite us and attract more people (and the workforce). MKR holders are controlling the pedals. Like Le Mans, it\u2019s an endurance race. But harder to win if you start 2 hours after everyone. ",

My problem here is that we are using stablecoins to back PEG management via the PSM.   Precisely what is the market cap of stablecoins denominated in other currencies? Don\u2019t get me wrong I am for other versions of DAI pegged to other currencies but I see Maker ending right back to same problems with USD/DAI PEG management relative to any other currencies or asset classes.

At this point we can\u2019t link it to dollar or euro by 100%. Stocks, commodities/ materials are floating in its value also. The aim must be to create non inflated currency that isn\u2019t floating. What doesn\u2019t floating is man power! If I cut my hairs same haircutter needs 15-20 min to do it, today and in 10 years also. If I cook a meal I need 30 min for it, today and in 100 years\u2026 So how can we link DAI to man power?  For the first step we should link it to dollar, to euro, to yen (33:33:33 %), we have to do some diversification mounthly we have to adjust the value of DAI depended to inflation. If inflation is growing DAI is growing to, and reverse. It means you have to pay more fiat for one DAI. second step is we have to compare what does a haircutter, an engineer, a medic (we have to pick maybe 10 relevant professions) costs today in USA, Europe, Asia. In one month we should compare the shifting of this professions. If you pay more for the same job in one month, one reason could be inflation, the second reason - we have not enough people to make this job. At this point we have to make DAI stronger - it means more fiat for one DAI third step is to link values of companies, easy way is to take USA stock market index S&P 500, Asia and Europe index. Higher index \u2192 more fiat for DAI. forth step (in the future) we should have the ability to lock not only digital coins, but also values - stocks, real estate and so on  ",

As well as technique.     megusta-01:  For the first step we should link it to dollar, to euro, to yen (33:33:33 %), we have to do some diversification   This article might help. Do you know how much a Big Mac is worth in the basket currencies? Yeah, no one does. Dai\u2019s superpower is being pegged to a value that everyone knows. The first one is USD because most international trade and FX are made to or through USD. Exploring regional currencies might work as well because several million people know the value of that regional currency. Also, note that we can change that peg to something more useful at any time. But it needs to be a value that everyone knows. Going back to your example, you probably know how much a haircut is where you live. If now you need a pocket calculator (I\u2019ve read these stopped being cool some time ago) every time you want to make a transaction, then the ease of use decreases immensely. Thanks again for your input and keep bringing back ideas (no matter how wild). ",

Then there is no reason to change your money in DAI. As I already said at this moment you have a backup if you use currency basket. The same is with DAI-Euro, I don\u2019t see the need of DAI-Euro. It does no matter if I buy a material asset in dollar or in euro, the value is retained. So maybe instead of DAI-Euro we should create DAI-stable (with currency basket)  Blockquote Thanks again for your input and keep bringing back ideas (no matter how wild).  thanks for listening  ",
