Private Keys should not migrate - educate users on the experience upfront so they know their value/the experience Also, worst user experience is to create another private key Can users bring their own private key? Smart contracts managing keys can help for generalized recovery mechanisms (you can always use those 12 words, lose the keys, etc.) MP challenged that this brings in the layer of centralized Trust - which may go against trustless systems principle Follow up reading: Uport white paper for consensus proposals for managing keys Jason shared that we need to educate users at the point of where they care - doesn\u2019t matter if you educate them upfront, it depends on what they need to use the wallet for and size (of need and transaction) matters. Boris mentioned how do we segregate wallet concepts as they different b/w blockchains vs. identity and login (reclaiming wallets/keys) Entity vs. Identity (Kopinski\u2019s whitepapers on user frameworks) Entity is my legal boundary, money is horizontally relevant (it is relevant to all communities that use that currency) Identity is the sum of all my entities and attention on aspects of you is what creates identity  made by a claim represented by an authoritative party (education, company, etc.); vertically relevant, you cannot take this relevance amongst other groups Research: Zippy on mobile access and storage, need to tie to mobile hardware and OS for powering mobile blockchain apps (must think beyond just Ethereum community when building wallet structures and must focus on the end user\u2019s goals/resources). How do we create the dApp userflow for using challenges to educate users to come on board with using their private key? Follow Ups UX Design for onboarding new users and understanding their wallets/private keys What technical needs do we have to consider for supporting multiple key management and recovery? ",

It should be something that should be embedded deeper into the operating system or browser, with more user friendly management scheme\u2019s on top. Casa wallet\u2019s managed wallet service (3 factor seed phrase recovery and social sharing) is really neat. More experimentation should be done in this regard, eventually building systems like @alexvandesande\u2019s personal DAO idea. Identity needs a lot more work. I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity here to redesign the account systems of all applications and ecosystems. Kill the password dead beyond all reckoning, and introduce new paradigms that are more secure and natural to users (device based authentication, universal profile, not having to set my profile picture on a new app).  Interesting idea I just had is that you can derive multiple accounts from your seed phrase\u2026 One (or more) account could be your personal, one could be your professional, or you could have one for each job you ever have, or every year you use a new one for tax reasons. Play with that a bit more? Seems interesting. Yes, it is probably too late for me to be rambling. ",

It begins at 8 minutes in, after your introduction and overview and some video crowd surfing.  A lively discussion ensues, with some key points surfacing such as questioning the reintroduction of trust by Maria from Golem at 17:32 after some musing that led to discussion of recovery mechanisms with Jarad of Status.

Then user requests our system to pull this signed message from smart contract and check it\u2019s signature. If signature can be verified, our server puts user data (first name, last name, birthdate, nationality, OpenPGP key fingerprint, Ethereum address) to smart contract on https://etherscan.io/address/0x846942953c3b2A898F10DF1e32763A823bf6b27 User data from this smart contract can be read by other smart contracts and decentralized applications. Users can use verified identity to make legal binding and also legally enforceable contracts/documents on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum address can be connected to one Cryptonomica verified OpenPGP key only, if OpenPGP key expires, user have to use another Ethereum address for new OpenPGP public key.
