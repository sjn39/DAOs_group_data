The group had three DAO-specific goals: - Collaborate Across Disciplines - Generate Research Priorities - Facilitate Future Research  Here\u2019s what we learned \ud83e\uddf5   5:07 PM - 7 Sep 2022           20                5            To add my personal experience, it was interesting how there\u2019s a gap between academia and contributers and delegates on the field. For example, I as well as others in the governance activities mostly agreed that sometimes decisions can be neither good or bad, and sometimes what some consider as malicious act might actually be rational act. We also helped to break some assumptions such as \u201cMarjority voting is bad\u201d. Overall, was an interesting experience ",
