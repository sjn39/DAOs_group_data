                    "content": "I was thinking about the Maker MKR delegate compensation and talking about this with a friend who is a former elected official. https://forum.makerdao.com/t/delegate-compensation-informal-poll As a delegate my own conflict of interest on this poll is that I stand to gain some \u2018compensation\u2019.  Whether a delegate or not, as a MKR holder I think if a delegate can self elect and then delegate to themselves their own MKR to \u2018earn compensation\u2019 this will be a potential system abuse vector.  Governance can limit this either by not giving compensation (the wrong approach btw), or by limiting compensation to all delegates to be a certain amount which is somehow divided between the delegates (which also is probably the wrong approach) that some kind of change in the delegate system to address these concerns is warranted. When I looked the situation there are a number of approaches one can try but there will always be some issue around fairness, and reasonable compensation for a certain level of delegate performance. I am going to make a suggestion that I believe solves a few issues around this regarding delegate performance and compensation and leave them up for discussion.  governance would do well to put up a certain number of elected Maker delegate \u2018slots\u2019.  Think of these like board member slots in a community.   There are a fixed number of positions determined by the community.   (5-10) They are elected positions anyone in the community can be elected into.   (open to all candidates) They have a fixed term of service (2 yrs) A compensation package. (under debate) Minimum performance requirements (see below)   once these slots are made available, anyone can formally apply to be a candidate to be elected into the delegate slot position.   MKR in delegation contracts can not self vote/elect (but must vote for others, this can be coded?) delegate candidate voting is ranked choice delegate slots are filled, up to the total available, in ranked choice order and to be elected to a slot must have some minimum amount of MKR.   Not all available slots need to be filled during an election cycle. MKR delegate elections (if slots are open) happen every 6 months. To be accepted as a candidate the delegate candidate (MIP proposal) must submit intention to run and the poll must pass with the minimum MKR required to fill an elected delegate position.   Elected Maker Delegate position minimum performance metric as follows:   Certain minimum MKR is delegated during the period (how to calculate/measure that is reasonable) Certain minimum voting, executive performance (% polls/executives) Other?  The elected formal Maker Delegate positions suggested above are the paid for/compensated positions with performance metrics that need to be satisfied for a delegate to retain their position (failure to do so initiates and automatic removal)   Given the openness of the delegation smart contract system anyone else can be a delegate but they should not be compensated, nor would other delegates have any performance metrics since the delegation model is such that MKR can\u2019t be forced off a delegate. One point I think governance and the protocol engineering team needs to think about.   Based on discussions with my friend I come to believe that no single delegate should be allow to represent more than a certain amount of MKR.  In the loosest sense it is true that a single entity could obtain enough MKR to control the system (no way to stop this btw via different wallets etc.) we are of the mind that formal and informal delegates should not be allowed to accumulate sufficient vote to pass executives themselves (this is like electing a MKR king who can do whatever they want with the protocol and should formally be avoided in the system if at all possible). I am not going to poll on this but leave it up for discussion and I am adding this conceptually to my own delegate platform as my own suggested changes to the Maker Delegate system. I believe MKR governance should formally create elected paid for Maker delegate positions (I am thinking we really want to fill 10), and to have a formal candidate process (which we already kind of have), as well as candidate compensation package, and to think about formal position requirements and the biggie for MKR to elect and fill these positions formally. Now Maker doesn\u2019t have to change anything, nor does it have to compensate a delegate in any way.  But I believe not changing the system at all will restrict delegates to only those who are financially independent, and open the system up to delegates being bribed and will restrict the participation in governance to \u2018whatever people want to give, vs. what the system needs\u2019. Also realize that there is nothing keeping the system from having other delegates, it is just that those delegates will not be formally compensated until or unless they are formally elected to a compensated elected delegate position. Also note here all elected delegates basically get the same compensation package, have to fulfill the same responsibilities and conditions and be formally elected to hold the elected delegate position.  Other delegates get no compensation, have no responsibilities, and don\u2019t need to be elected. Submitted as an idea for discussion of the evolution of the Maker delegate system as an approach to settle whether and how to compensate Maker Delegate question. ",
