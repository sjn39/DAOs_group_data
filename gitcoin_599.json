Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!   Meta-Governance    The proposal to Integrate dCompass within dGitcoin to build dQuests & dKnowledge has received feedback from the required amount of Stewards. The proposal is now live on Snapshot until Nov 7th.   Gitcoin Financial Reporting by Elliot from Llama presents GitcoinDAO Treasury Report for September 2021. The report is the first out of a series of monthly treasury reports with the ambition to \u201cprovide insight into the performance of Gitcoin\u201d.   CrossStream DAOops & Community XP Funding by DisruptionJoe presents options for how the \u201cCrossStream DAOops Governance squad (CSDG), which makes decisions that affect the entire DAO, should be governed\u201d. The thread is a continuation of the conversation started on the FDD Q4 Budget Proposal.   Owocki authored a thread on Twitter with slides on how \u201cEthereum is Solarpunk\u201d. The thread describes how \u201cEthereum is a schelling point for the hopeful\u201d and how it is a \u201ccampfire we can rally around, and together, that we can use to create a cyberpunk world AND a solarpunk world.\u201d   The discussion around Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error is ongoing with the author Tardigrade continuing to answer questions regarding the proposal.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     Decentralize Gitcoin Workstream Budget Request - Q4 2021 MMM Q4 2021 Budget Proposal # Prototyping Workstream ( Moonshot) Budget Request - Q4 2021 2    Proposal - Request to fund FDD workstream Q4 2021 budget  Moonshot Workstream Allocation Q4 # Proposal to Ratify the Results of GR11     Integrate dCompass within dGitcoin to build dQuests & dKnowledge dCompass (build dQuests & dKnowledge) - Q4 Budget request    Gitcoin Discovery: Decentralize the Knowledge Base & Quests     Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    The Library continues to bring together a fantastic group of people to discuss public goods each week.   A second RFP, continuing the ethos of Seeking a New Kind of Public Good, is in planning.   Over $600k has been raised so far for Grants Round 12 and partnership discussions with other web3 x social impact organizations have begun.   The first workstream payments have been made to key contributors in the Public Goods workstream. Formal accounting will be moving into cross-DAO ops in time for the second budget proposal. Progress has been made on onboarding, which will also move into a larger cross-DAO ops initiative     Moonshot Collective    The vote to ratify the Moonshot Collective budget request for Q4 2021 has passed and is now live on Tally for a formal on-chain vote.   The Greatest LARP launched on Wednesday, October 20 to great fanfare! So far 4 of 5 ETHBot Statues have been sold, as well as 158 ETHBot NFTs. The next level will be unlocked once 200 ETHBot NFTs have been minted. More than $180,000 has been raised to fund public goods so far. Owocki authored a thread describing the \u201cWomp womp\u201d-mechanism and a poll to determine if, and how it should be used. The poll resulted in executing the Womp womps around 9am MST every day, Kevin will post in the telegram channel when the txns are submitted.   Every Friday the Moonshot Collective gets together to show off their progress. Individual projects demo what they\u2019ve been working on. This week three projects shared their work: Anon Vs Moloch, Moonswap, and Decentralized Recruiter. Demo videos for each project can be found on this YouTube playlist.   Follow @MoonshotCollect onTwitter for frequent updates. Learn more by saying hello in Discord, or checking out our site.     Decentralize Gitcoin    The dGTC Workstream Q4 Budget Proposal has been posted on the forum by Philip for review. The proposal brings the Data & DevOps project into this workstream. A team to design a sybil score aggregation protocol and build a POC implementation will be added. The workstream is also planning to add community contributors to the dGrants team to increase velocity and scale.   The Moonshot Collective dGrants Round Proof of Concept is currently running and is scheduled to end on Sunday, October 31st at 11:59PM EST. As of Wednesday morning, Oct 27, the round had 11 grants and $5,449.54 worth of matching funds available. A total of 14 grants have been created and approved with 105 contributions. We\u2019d love for you to test with us! Fund your favorite grant or builder before matching ends on Sunday and provide feedback in the Discord channel #dgtc-feedback (under Decentralize Gitcoin).     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    The FDD Q4 Budget Proposal will be moving to Snapshot after healthy deliberation on the forum. Owocki expressed concern about CrossStream DAOops & Community initiatives being included in the FDD Budget. FDD had brought the issue to the CrossStream DAOops Governance (CSDG) last Tuesday and passed a proposal to include these streams funding as to not interrupt contributor payments, but intending to spin out these streams. Multiple CSDG reps were in Lisbon last week and missed the vote.   For decisions that affect all streams, the CSDG has reps from each stream which vote on the proposal before changes are made. They hand it off to a specialist squad to drive a solution, which then is approved by the CSDG before implementation. After Owocki\u2019s post on the proposal in the Governance forum, FDD brought the proposal back to CSDG again this Tuesday. The conclusion was that the FDD budget will include these initiatives, however, FDD will expedite the creation of a multisig with one rep from each workstream to govern the CrossStream DAO Ops funding.   Another decision is that the FDD Legal & Accounting Squads will be integrated into the CrossStream DAOops, this will be a gradual process, with support of Kyle and Joe.   The FDD workstream published a document outlining the State of FDD Q3 2021. The document describes the role of defending Gitcoin, how FDD provides value to the Gitcoin community, FDD\u2019s vision, mission, values, strategies, how FDD plans to progressively decentralize, Q3 accomplishments & Q4 deliverables. Includes a breakdown of all initiatives & squads. Worth a read if you want to get a better handle on this workstream!     Merch, Memes & Marketing    The MMM Q4 budget is live on Tally to get ratified on-chain, please vote to ensure we reach quorum!   A design bounty for Grants Round 12 was posted. For Grants Round 12 going forward, design bounties will be funded and maintained by MMM (previously supported by the Gitcoin Holdings design team).   MMM is representing Gitcoin DAO at the ForeFront DAOlloween event in gather.town this Friday, the 29th. This is a special-themed metaverse networking event where ticket holders \u201cgather\u201d in the metaverse to get acquainted with representatives from other sponsoring DAOs. Special tokens and POAPs will be rewarded to lucky participants.   Matthew proposed \u201cMMM Raids\u201d to scale operations. MMM Raids are \u201can efficient and flexible way for people to request, approve, disperse, and account for funds in MMM initiatives, with minimal bureaucracy and maximum transparency.\u201d   To request or propose a new project for MMM - please fill out the MMM-Request Typeform!     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement.

The vote to ratify the dCompass Budget Request for Q4 2021 has passed and steps have been taken to propose a formal on-chain vote.   Payouts for the Moonshot Collective round have been executed.   Development related to running a round in Grants Round 12 is ramping up. Priorities include Performance, My Grants page, My Donations page, GrantRegistry, and Contract Updates.   The team is preparing to build the ML pipeline infrastructure.   dGitcoin is starting to gather DAO-wide data needs from stakeholders     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    The team needs a top Steward to create the proposal on Tally after Q4 Budget passed last week on Snapshot. Many seem confused by the double vote on Snapshot and Tally. Snapshot is where the vote takes place after a deliberation period on the governance forum. Tally is essentially a multisig with 18k keyholders!   All contributor payments for Q3 have been made. FDD spent less than the projected budget on the initiatives listed on the original proposal. Our support of CrossStream DAOops including onboarding, Notion revamp, and others put our total spending for the Quarter at around $5-10k over the 25k GTC Q3 proposal budget estimate at a price of $10/GTC.   The first forking of a squad has happened. The grants approval squad split into two squads each with their own mechanism for splitting dRewards. The initial effect has been more engagement by the initiators of the fork to prep and train new onboards. We\u2019ll report back on long term effects.   Sybil Detection took a big step forward as we connected the different teams on Q4 deliverables and forward-looking vision. These include the Gitcoin Holdings GPG team, dGrants, Data & DevOps stream, Omnianalytics, and Blockscience. Deliverables can be found on the FDD homepage.   The FDD research group is picking up steam as a bottom-up governance designed stream from the start. They will have 4 researchers participating in the TE Governauts Open Science program studying DAO Compensation Policies. As GitcoinDAO doesn\u2019t have enough history to provide good data for a study of this type, we thought it would be advantageous to pay GitcoinDAO contributors to participate as researchers studying the results in other DAOs.     Merch, Memes & Marketing    The Q4 budget has been transferred to the MMM-Multisig. Compensation for contributors and other expenses for October will be sent out this week. Our first Raid proposals will also be awarded. If you\u2019re part of another workstream and you need design/marketing support from MMM - please utilize our Request Typeform!   Memepalooza #3 happened last Friday! The event lasted three hours and hosted 74 unique visitors who contributed to the creation of 100+ memes accompanied by a live DJ streaming from Twitch. Participants were awarded POAPs and GTC. There was also an NFT-raffle and some Schwag Store coupons given away to some excellent Meme lords.   The playtesting-phase of the Degen vs Regen-card game has been completed. Thanks to everyone who participated! Tweaks to game mechanics as well as artwork are being worked on and finalized. Once done, we\u2019ll be hosting recurring tournaments with the broader community.   If you\u2019re a schwag-designer, don\u2019t miss out on the GR12 Schwag design bounty - $500 will be awarded to the best designer, with smaller rewards to the runner-up. There\u2019s still time left to apply!     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in Discord!

Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!   Meta-Governance     Owocki published a series of posts this week after the deactivation of a grant last week. Read to learn more about how GitcoinDAO Stewards govern Gitcoin, and how that might change over time.

Our treasury diversification paid off! $150k USDC was bought over the last 2 weeks. We are now moving into ETH with the down market at parity. Our goal is approximately 50% GTC, 25% ETH, 25% stables (USDC/DAI/RAI) We are modeling a non-transferrable governance token for FDD to start examining decision integrity in different models alongside our current processes during Q1 2021.

Monday the 20th at 3pm UTC (10am EST) - Inviting relevant ecosystem guests Three out of five rounds of human evaluations have been completed totaling almost 3k reviews. Our data science squad performed an analysis of results to help us better review in the future rounds. We worked with Trueblocks as a contributor to FDD to create onchain data features for our ml algorithm. This will help the community data science group hit their Q4 deliverable of having one onchain feature in the ml pipeline. Final run of Blockscience algo to be run Monday afternoon. This is the one that is currently used for addressing the sybil accounts. Kevin published The Gitcoin Anti-Sybil Flywheel     Grant Eligibility  We made a new squad which aptly named itself the Grant Investigation Agency. Tasked with handling the grants disputes using Ethelo software, they talked to stakeholders to criteria for distributed adjudication of grants. This round we will run this process in parallel to the previous review squad model. A post round review will allow us to assign proper weighting to use the system to scale grant approvals and decrease turnaround time for GR13. Grants created after Dec 10th will not be approved for this round. Our review squads are now working on the dispute backlog which can be seen at our public Grants Disputes oversight page. Feel free to comment directly on the page!    Research  TE Governauts DAO Compensation Open Science Program had its halfway event. While GitcoinDAO is not a subject matter, 5 of the FDD researchers are participating in the study of DAO Compensation Models.

If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.  Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!   Meta-Governance    Owocki announced Schelling Point in Denver Colorado the day before ETH Denver on February 17th. The event is a one-day celebration of mechanism design, coordination tech, public goods, culture and regen finance. Join the conversation in the Telegram chat.   Transcending the Individualism & Collectivist Divide by Owocki makes the case that \u201cthere is a large opportunity to create alignment between these Individualist/Collectivist communities with web3 (and thereby move past the differences with views on public goods funding).\u201dIndividualists/Collectivists do not agree how to organize society. These disagreements were amplified by the nation-state era. We can bridge this divide with web3.   Laurence started a thread titled dGrant solution to discuss the challenges and possible solution to improve the Decentralized Grants Verification. The thread introduces the role of a \u201cWatcher\u201d that can flag suspicious submissions and send them to the \u201cGitcoin Grant Court\u201d to challenge.   Owocki authored a thread titled Where does the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool Money Come From? To give more insight and recognition to the projects and individuals that help fund the Matching pool for Grant Rounds. \u201cAs of Nov 2021, the Grants Multisig has roughly $15mm of tokens in it. At $1m/round and 1round/quarter, that is 15 rounds of Gitcoin Grants forward funded (for 3.5 years).\u201d A big thank you to all the fantastic funders of Gitcoin Grants!   The GitcoinDAO Notion is undergoing a major revamp by QZ and Vishnu to make the experience more streamlined and easier to navigate. Right now there\u2019s not a whole lot to see just yet, but we will be rolling out the new design during the next few days.   Lately you might also have noticed a lot moving around in the GitcoinDAO Discord: some channels popped up, others disappeared, and this is all part of a bigger plan to help people find their way around more easily. Kris and Alp have been focusing on this over the past couple of weeks, more updates coming soon!     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     dExplorer (Bounty / Fund Bounty)  dGTC Workstream Q4 Budget Proposal   Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error        Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    Annika has been ramping up as a grants-ops lead. She published a proposal for Gitcoin GR12 Matching Pool Allocations to \u201cdiscuss and finalize how funding allocations for the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 Matching Pool are distributed and how to use categories (if at all). After previous successful Grants Rounds, this proposal aims to continue community-owned decision making.\u201d   The Ethereum Foundation announced their allocation of $500k to help fund crypto policy advocacy; other thematic rounds continue to make progress in the background.   The first Public Goods Twitter Space was hosted on Monday by Alisha and Lani, the event aims to help push the mission of public goods to a broader audience, QZ made a summary.   The first official librarian meeting was held to discuss the future of library onboarding and content curation.   As we get closer to being able to execute small test token swaps, we have also begun to seed and fund a number of other partnerships with orgs including DeveloperDAO, Verses, and DreamDAO.     Moonshot Collective    The GreatestLARP is going strong as 118 of 200 Molochs needed to open Level 4 (The Final Boss) have been minted. We have settled on a \u201cwomp womp\u201d policy for Level 3, which adjusts the bonding curve in case minting slows. So far The Greatest LARP has raised over $338,000 for public goods. That\u2019s a green-pilling! Owocki published a new poll on the go-live policy for level 4 (The Final Boss), which is about a week away at current pace.   Last Friday we dogfooded several Moonshot projects including Recruiter.Party, Tip.Party, and Tokenstream.Party. Get caught up on what they\u2019re all about on our YouTube.   Moonshot Collective is the prototyping workstream of GitcoinDAO, do you want to help tell its story? We need writers, video producers, designers, and more. Come say hello in the Discord.     Decentralize Gitcoin    The Decentralized Gitcoin Workstream budget for Q4 has been executed on chain.   Currently the grant approval/denial process is very unclear in the interface to the end user. We are working on adding some clarity to the UI and process around this. My Grants and My Contributions pages are also being worked on.   The Data/DevOps substream has made movement on getting the sybil resistance machine learning pipeline running and is currently waiting for BlockScience to complete updates required to make it possible to run in a new environment   We are actively interviewing product and project management candidates for our workstream to help with both dGrants and our other projects     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    The Sybil Detection pipeline gained a devops person to run the operational processes and algorithm developed by Blockscience while also beginning work on a community data lake. Combined with the anonymized data model for the open source feature engineering pipeline will create a wide range of community participation which wasn\u2019t possible before.   Sybil Detection stream is looking to make a proposal to receive funding from ENS. They are also looking to contribute funding to BrightID, Proof of Humanity, and Idena to share datasets making more features available for detecting sybil accounts in a flywheel of reinforcement between identity and reputation.   The research stream passed its first proposal and will also be sending 5 Ph.D. researchers to participate in Token Engineering\u2019s Governauts DAO Comp Policy study. They will study the mechanisms used by other DAOs and the effects they create.   The user support stream will be moving to the DAOops stream. This includes the knowledge base maintenance and the translation squads. FDD will send the remainder of their Q4 budget when they are set up with a governance structure or by request of the DAOops stream.    FDD Weekly Flags:  Yellow Flag: Aligned on next steps for legal. Gray area on contributor agreements in the meantime Green Flag: CrossStream DAOops governance made a plan for How we make decisions! Red Flag: Steward compensation could change options for entity type & tax requirements Yellow Flag: Need some parameters for judging squad/stream health Yellow Flag: How might we track insights from RAID models that don\u2019t pay directly to contributors?      Merch, Memes & Marketing    The development substream of MMM is currently building out the Meme Museum. The purpose of the site is to provide an archive of web3 related memes for the broader community to reuse and to celebrate Memelords and artists.   A first version of the workstream\u2019s website is currently being developed. The site will act as the team\u2019s portfolio and create a more intuitive first point of contact for new contributors.   The \u201cMMM\ud83e\udd1dMC comms\u201d-raid has been passed and funded. Matt leads the raid and is actively seeking new content creators, writers and video editors for the mission. Reach out on Discord if you would like to contribute!   The @GitcoinDAO Twitter account has been transformed into Gitcoin vibes. The account will interact with the community in a more fun and informal manner. The @ Gitcoin Twitter-handle will continue to be used as a way to announce events, initiatives and news. We are looking for contributors to manage @ GitcoinDAO, reach out if you\u2019re interested!   We\u2019ve seen some great submissions to our GR12-Schwag-bounty which will end next week. We look forward to onboard more talented designers and collaborate on the ETHDenver-swag pack and upcoming merch-drop!     Upcoming community events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement.

If you would like to receive this newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.  Without further ado, let\u2019s dive in!   Meta-Governance    Polygon has committed one of the largest single donations to the public goods treasury in Gitcoin history with a $1 million towards funding Public Goods, including $200,000 for upcoming Grants Round 12! Gitcoin is now also supporting grants checkout with Polygon.   Grants Round 12 will go live soon! Gitcoin\u2019s biggest quarterly event is kicking off on December 1st and running through December 16th, 2021. On Wednesday, Dec 1st at 10:00 am MST Gitcoin will be hosting the GR12 Kick-Off event. Core Gitcoin contributors will present alongside key partners to celebrate the beginning of GR12 and showcase the many improvements we\u2019re making to our flagship grants offering.   Elliot from Llama published the GitcoinDAO treasury report for October 2021 with some key highlights. The statements are split into transactions denoted in the governance token GTC and separate transactions in stablecoins.   The dGrant solution discussion started by Laurence on possible improvements to the Decentralized Grants Verification has moved on from the forum to the #dgrants-feedback channel on Discord.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     dExplorer (Bounty / Fund Bounty) FDD Workstream Q4 2021 Budget    Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error Gitcoin GR12 Matching Pool Allocations       Workstream Discussion   Public Goods Funding    Annika has been ramping up as a grants-ops lead. She published a proposal for Gitcoin GR12 Matching Pool Allocations to \u201cdiscuss and finalize how funding allocations for the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 Matching Pool are distributed\u201d. The proposal is currently live on Snapshot.   On top of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s announcement, a number of new funders have come in for GR12 including Chainlink, EPNS, and KlimaDAO. More to come next week!   The second Public Goods Twitter Space was hosted on Monday by Alisha and Lani, featuring Niran from Panvala. The event aims to help push the mission of public goods to a broader audience.     Moonshot Collective    The GreatestLARP continues! Help coordinate to stop Moloch while raising funds for public goods. We are mid Level 3, with 144 of 200 Molochs needed to open Level 4 minted. Wanna play? We expect to reach 200 Molochs minted sometime within the week, which will unlock The Final Boss. The GreatestLARP has already raised over $338,000 for public goods.   This week we launched our new blog. If you\u2019d like to learn more about Moonshot Collective, check out our \u2018Hello World\u2019 post here.   This week we dogfooded Season 1 priorities Recruiter.Party, and Retroactive Public Goods Funding Starter Kit (Payback). Check out our demo videos on the Moonshot Collective Youtube.     Decentralize Gitcoin    Performance fixes have been implemented in the dGrants platform around blockchain data retrieval, indexed data retrieval from The Graph, and IPFS data retrieval resulting in a much more snappy feeling when browsing grants on dGrants.   The GrantRound contract that will be used for GR12 has been finalized and deployed.   We have added a few new features like a My Grants page and My Contributions page which will help give insight into your own actions on the platform.   We are finalizing the list of eligible grants that will be a part of the \u2018Gitcoin Building\u2019 Grant Round in GR12.   Migrating the Anti Sybil pipeline infrastructure and code from Bloc Science to the Gitcoin DAO is underway and making progress.   The DevOps sub-stream is beginning a discovery phase intended to learn what additions would have the highest immediate impact on the DAO based on needs across the board.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    Contributor payments for Epochs 1 & 2 have been paid using Gilden mass pay. Contributors receive an email notification with the transaction hash; with a gas cost of about $250 for the entire workstream we\u2019re able to cover each biweekly payment.   Anti-Sybil ML:  Changing the name to Sybil Detection. This week Blockscience is delivering a refactored code while the ASOP were set up by the new DAO DevOps lead. The feature engineering squad identified new patterns from Github data and is developing processes and access policies to make it easier for new contributors to participate. Onchain Forensics work starts this week having accepted Trueblocks to help guide how we use onchain data to not only identify sybil behavior, but also to educate Gitcoin users about the transparency of their on-chain activities.    Research:  Added 2 squads this week. Risks & Threats will be studying sybil attacks and other threats to the grants mechanism. They will identify other threats and risks to the DAO as well. These learnings will be used to draft proposals to dive deeper into mitigation techniques. Growth & Experimentation will be looking at stream & squad governance and compensation policies working within GitcoinDAO to define and conduct experiments teaching us how to grow.    Policy:  The GitcoinDAO Appeals Panel now has over 10 members to hear out any appeals to decisions made by the FDD Grant Approvals and Disputes squads. The panel consists of industry experts from projects like BrightID, Idena, and 1Hive and are chosen for their expertise in identifying sybil behavior.    DAOops is spinning out of FDD as planned on the Q4 budget proposal. FDD is ready to send the funds to the multisig for DAOops providing a clean transition of responsibility and accountability. Gitcoin Holdings is working on a governance proposal to formalize a DAOops workstream consisting of:   CrossDAO Operations - Opt-in shared infrastructure services governed by the CrossStream DAOops Governance council with reps from each workstream, DAOops, and Gitcoin Holdings. The squads include Onboarding Hosts, DAO Tooling, and People Operations.   DAOServices - Conducts business for the DAO as a whole like legal and accounting work. Looking to be more clearly defined in the proposal being drafted to be ratified by the stewards.   Support offering contributor support, user support, steward support etc. The current User Support stream also hosts the knowledge base, knowledge acquisition incentives and translations & localization efforts.       Merch, Memes & Marketing    The Merch bounty for GR12 ends on Friday, we\u2019re excited to reward the winners and get the art up on the schwag store. A couple of the designers from the bounty have been onboarded to the workstream and are continuing the work on the schwag pack for ETHDenver.   The first version of the Meme Museum is planned to launch during the next Memepalooza which will take place next Friday, Dec 3. Preparations for the event are also ongoing.   Our Notion got a revamp last week and we are working on creating header images and design elements to be used by the different initiatives in Notion and elsewhere. Work has also begun to create virtual backgrounds for meetings.     Upcoming Community Events    Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM EDT in Discord! We have been seeing great attendance and engagement.   Community Onboarding Call! New to Gitcoin?

Meta-Governance    Nader published a proposal for a Partnership & Mutual Grant with Developer DAO. \u201cThe proposal, if passed, would issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 5% of Developer DAO when governance is live. The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3 than ever before through education and events, as well as supporting the creation and distribution of public goods.\u201d   Owocki authored a thread titled Coordination.Party Kit that describes the Coordination Party Kit that Moonshot Collective is working on and aiming to launch in February at Schelling Point. The Kit is a \u201ctool suite that helps recruit, recognize, reward, and retain contributors to DAOs.\u201d If you would like to try out the CPKP in your own DAO, please join the coordination.party 2/17 launch Telegram group    A Community Based Roadmap for Sybil Detection Across Web 3 by Joe describes the problems of sybil attacks on the Gitcoin platform and how the FDD-workstream works towards solving these problems. The post ends with an exploration of the possibility of a \u201cA Sybil Detection DAO\u201d with collaboration between DAOs to combat attacks.     GitcoinDAO Governance Overview     Proposal Discussions Active Proposals Latest completed proposals     Partnership & Mutual Grant with Developer DAO dCompass Q4 Budget request # FDD Workstream Q4 2021 Budget    Redistribute GTC to Individuals Who Could Not Claim Due to Error  # Gitcoin GR12 Matching Pool Allocations       Workstream Discussion    Public Goods Funding    Grants Round 12 goes live this week, with over $2m in matching pool funding from a variety of ecosystem partners like ENS, Ethereum Foundation, and NounsDAO   NounsDAO in particular has committed one of the largest single amounts of funding ever at 169 ETH, with a special NounsBot auction set to happen later this week   Moreover, PGF successfully set up over 10 rounds in total for GR12, including three cause rounds focusing on advocacy, climate, and longevity   The public library and public goods PR squads continue to push forward on helping promote and expand the discourse around public goods; Aya from the Ethereum Foundation and a number of other exciting speakers are coming up!   We\u2019ve continued to solidify partnerships with groups like DeveloperDAO, Verses, and more.     Moonshot Collective    The GreatestLARP, a multi-level coordination game to fund public goods is down to the final level and we need you! Join us on Dec 6 for the kick-off party where we\u2019ll come together to beat The Final Boss. Save the date here!   The GreatestLARP has already raised approximately $400K for public goods, with the opportunity to raise hundreds of thousands more.   How does it work? We must crowdfund 50 ETH to unlock Level 4\u2019s final battle between Moloch and our ETHBot hero, enshrined as a 1:1 NFT. All proceeds fund public goods, but not only that: crowdfund participants own a portion of the NFT, based on how much they contribute. Let\u2019s coordinate to take down Moloch!     Decentralize Gitcoin    Final bug fixes being pushed out in preparation for Grants Round 12 start.   \u2018My Grants\u2019 feature is done and merged, \u2018My Contributions\u2019 final review and will be merged soon.   The \u2018Gitcoin Building Gitcoin\u2019 grant round has been deployed to Polygon.   Grants are being created for the round on the dGrants production instance.   Working on an improved support process and grant review/approval process.     Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD)    The Sybil Detection pipeline presents a novel way for participatory self-governance for user-driven content moderation. Solving sybil-resistance and exporting it to any dapp developer will unlock quadratic voting and staking mechanisms across web 3.   Omnianalytics presented on an FDD contributor access management framework. \u201cYou\u2019ve thrown a diverse group of highly motivated people onto an island with plenty of food, water, and raw materials and given them the mandate to build a city. Considering their backgrounds, the landscape and various hidden constraints, how should they coordinate to get things done?\u201d  We, the Anti-Sybil FDD team, are the castaways. The resources are our smarts, motivation and the budget. The landscape is the currently available technology stack. The mandate is to build out a ML Anti-Sybil defense for the GitcoinDAO. The city we\u2019re building is that Machine Learning pipeline and process.    Formal research on the motivation and profiling of sybil attackers began in the research initiative. Identifying the motivations behind these attacks will give us better insights into protecting quadratic funding.   In Q3, FDD took the initiative to ensure that contributors got paid and that the DAO mitigated potential issues which could be avoided. Now the process of finding out where these streams are best situated is beginning to take shape. The unspent funds for DAOops in Q4 will be sent to the new CrossStream DAOops multisig     Merch, Memes & Marketing    Memepalooza 4 will take place this upcoming Friday. The event is a 3-hour long meme creation-session with meme lords from the broader community joining forces to meme public goods, the open internet and the values of Gitcoin.   Memes.party, a website to celebrate meme lords and great memes, was demoed earlier this week and is set to launch on Friday at Memepalooza 4. Participants of Memepalooza will be the first to test out the new tool.   The schwag bounty put up by the workstream ended last Friday. We had over 20 people submit designs. After much deliberation by the MMM design-substream, three winners were chosen and announced on Discord. The 1st place winner was awarded 500 DAI and the two with 100DAI to the two runners up. All items will be up in the Gitcoin store shortly.     Upcoming community events    Memepalooza 4, the monthly meme design jam session hosted by the MMM-workstream is happening this Friday. Join the meme party in Discord at 2PM ET / 7PM UTC.   Drop in on our weekly DAO Vibes & Office Hours w. Kevin Owocki on Wednesdays at 12PM ET in Discord!
