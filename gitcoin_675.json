Proposal Body : This is a request to fund the Moonshot Collective with GTC from GitcoinDAO Treasury for Q2 2022. The moonshot collective is a collection of builders & web3 community members who are prototyping experiments in coordination. Last request for funding: Q4 21\u2019 (skipped Q1 22\u2019) Workstream Objectives: Our target state is to build an innovation machine that systematically rapidly prototypes new coordination tools and takes them to market.

Gitcoin Metaverse Comic #3 released  GreatestLARP.com raised $500k for grants multisig 6 High Quality Schelling Point activations planned Moonshot Collective is proving to be a natural convergence point for web3 contributors who not only want to see this space succeed, but want to accelerate the pace at which we can successfully coordinate with one another. 21 Streams deployed 6 successful pay party elections for MC Contributors (and counting) Voted on signers and deployed a baby multisig (Funded with monthly burn) where our devs get to feel our products.

Optimism chooses to use MC\u2019s MVP to elect badge holders for their next round of RetroPGF Vitalik blogs about RGPF and mentions Gitcoin in it.   Objective: dPopp is successful  KR: MVP of dPOPP launches by July 1 2022 Can integrate with POH + BrightID At least 100 users have connected their identity.

I know MSC has been growing the team, and decentralizing decision making on fund appropriation would be a great step to honor the growth of the team. Further, having multisig members who are your \u201ccustomers\u201d would really enforce the feedback loop too. Not sure if you have identified who your customers are yet, but I would love to see 1 or 2 of those on the multisig to offer a signal on the outcomes you are delivering. The budget request breakdown is pretty hand wavy. Asking for 80k GTC for \u201cproduct/prototype builds.\u201d Do you have ideas on how that will be spent yet? Local contributors, outside contracting firms, etc. As I think about the budget here, with little details on the 80k, having more accountability on the multisig would be a great first step. I think about this in two ways. Low detail/accountability on the budget request, high detail/accountability on distribution of funds (more multi-sig holders). Or perhaps the inverse. ",

It is true that Moonshot Bots, which raised $3mm for Grants matching pool, was mostly a Kevin/Austin YOLO to start. I\u2019d just briefly challenge this assertion by pointing out a few counter examples that the collective has built:  Successes at Moonshot that did not deeply involve Austin/Kevin   Quadratic Trust, was led by @anneconnelly and her team with only recruiting/advisory support from myself and Austin, and was able to build & ship a social quadratic curation experience that successfully was used by hundreds of people during GR11, and proved that Quadratic Funding can be used for curation (something that\u2019s been on the core team backlog for a very long time).  The Greatest LARP was built by a half dozen people from the collective (though it was my vision), and raised $500k for public goods + the comic was read thousands of times.  Tip.Party, TokenStream.party, and pay.party, and the inchoate multisiend app have each been used dozens of times to reward Moonshot Devs, and are run almost entirely without my involvement.  Though to your point these tools need more work to cross-pollinate to other DAOs. There will be a half dozen marketing activations at schelling point driven by Moonshoters with almost no involvement by myself/Austin. An art gallery, actors doing on-theme performances, NFT auctions, a POAPathon, and a few other bespoke activations.  I cannot say how successful these are yet, perhaps on Friday we can.   Successes in Rapid Prototyping at Gitcoin And even before the Moonshot Collective launched in July 2021, there was a track record of successful YOLO innovation happening in/around GitcoinDAO.  For example:   Fundoss - a QF application for web2 that successfully raised $95k for web2 oss. (2021)  Downtown stimulus - a QF application that successfully raised $45k for Boulder COVId relief. (2020)  WTFisQF - an easy QF calculator/explainer, used by 100s of ppl per month.  (2020)  QuadraticVote.co - an easy tool for hosting Quadratic Votes, used by 100s of ppl per month (2020) Hosting Sustainweb3 - a one day conference about OSS sustainability, with attendance in the 100s and video watches in the 1000s (2020) the launch of Gitcoin Labs and the Burner Wallet, with my friend Austin Griffith (2019) Various experiments & products launched on Gitcoin.co including small experiments like Gitcoin Quests, Gitcoin Kudos, the Quadratic Lands, an avatar builder, a quadratic funding social network, and other tools that later evolved into being flagships like Gitcoin Hackathons or Gitcoin Grants. (over the years) a handful of other tools that recorded here and here (over the years)  Of course, Moonshot Collective does not take credit for the innovation that precedes it, but it is cut from the same cloth of this innovation - so it is worth mentioning it to give full context.  In Conclusion It is true that the Moonshot Collective does need more work to get to its target state, and the recent additions of two product managers and a project manager (and the systems they set up) are investments in getting more systematic about the progress towards product market fit. But I think we should start that journey with a consensus that the tools sometimes reach product market fit right now. I also want to dispel the notion that the only successes have come from myself/Austin  (they have been the result of the work of ppl in many corners of the collective). ",

We are tackling this in two ways:  Short term: cleaning up the usability and intuitiveness of the tools we\u2019ve already built (specifically pay, tokenstream, and tip) and getting them into users hands Longer term: digging into evidence-based research about how DAO workstreams outside of our own function, drawing a map of a typical DAO\u2019s landscape, identifying the big white spaces, and going after solving those big, exciting problems  Tip will be going live at Schelling Point (woohoo!) and we plan to have Pay certainly and Tokenstream hopefully in a much more usable place by the end of the month.

I appreciate you noting this and I want to echo that this is my sentiment as well. The work of the collective is and needs to continue to be stronger than just the funding brought in for matching pool (though that is important). The callout on other projects is helpful, but my primary concern is that the funding feels immense without clear details on how to spend it. I am being critical right now of another workstream to request a large reserve (which is contentious), and to instead use the governance process quarterly to ensure they are accountable. It feels appropriate to ask the same of MSC \u2013 to have a budget with details on how it plans to spend and not make requests that are too large for their needs. Is this something DAO Ops can help with? How can we support you all with this type of planning? @emudoteth ",

No Workstream has received budgets for \u2018Q1\u2019 (DAOops & PGF proposals passed previously, but they will now also follow the seasons), dates: 2.1 to 4.30 (GR13 | 3.9-3.24). So no seasons/quarters have been skipped here. I agree with @kyle\u2019s feedback that this is a massive request by a workstream that has work to do on internal organization & communication. At the same time the output has been impressive and has resulted in millions of funding for public goods, and big strides are being made on project management by hiring new people. I will probably abstain from voting on this proposal because I\u2019m also missing transparency on how funds will be spent, and want to hold all workstreams to the same standards. Unfortunately I have no time to dive/dig deeper by myself at this moment but knowing some of the people in this team & the massive and diverse talents they bring to the table I\u2019m looking forward to what\u2019s next, including more in-depth reporting & budget planning! #publicgoodsaregood ",

In fact it would be better if there is some coordination between the different workstreams on funding requirements and reporting so it\u2019s easier for stewards to provide a proper judgement. The moonshot collective has produced some cool stuff but I am afraid that without some proper reporting and and accountability process we won\u2019t be able to really judge funding requests and we will either be left to flat-out decline or accept anything that comes our way. That said I don\u2019t want to block this funding request as I have also been critical of FDD for different reasons and I did not block that either. But please let\u2019s improve for next season otherwise I will have to either start rejecting or abstain from voting. ",
