Twitter followers: 201.2k (+0.95% WoW) Number of tweets: 23 (+228% WoW) Twitter engagement rate: 0.62% (-43% WoW)   During this week we worked on defining a Tweets calendar and a process for CUs to add their tweets to the calendar. We hire a media agency to support us whenever we need more than written content in our threads to improve the content assets.    We strongly increased the number of tweets and the number of impressions (+500% on a 28-day basis).   The drop in the engagement rate shows us the engagement (actions that people do in our tweets: likes, comments, retweets), is not increasing at the same rate as impressions.   We will tweet more content that helps us initiate conversations with our audience, replicating the interaction we got with this tweet, as it gave us good results in engagement.
