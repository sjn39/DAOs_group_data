                    "content": "Utrecht University and the University of Amsterdam are researching the process of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) platform selection for Software Producing Organizations. Recently, we designed and implemented a Decision Support System for technology selection, such as DBMS and Blockchain Platform Selection, that supports software architectures, developers, and other decision-makers at software-producing organizations in the initial phase of software development. The research is part of the SecureSECO project (https://secureseco.org/). I am one of the researchers on the project and work in close cooperation with dr. Slinger Jansen (Utrecht University) and dr. Siamak Farshidi (University of Amsterdam). In the current phase of the research, we evaluate different DAO platforms based on their features. Accordingly, we collected a set of potential features that different DAO platform might support. Currently, we have considered 27 DAO platform in our evaluation. If you know about their features, we would ask you kindly to indicate the supportability of the features by these DAO platforms (Please see the following Google sheet). docs.google.com   DAO Platform Evaluation   For more information, please visit our websites: https://dss-mcdm.com https://secureseco.org ",
