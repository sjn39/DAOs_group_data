Paragraph Summary This proposal contains:  Team MKR Rewards Plan Distribution Implementation   Specification  Motivation The motivations for providing MKR Rewards to contributors are to:  Attract top talent Provide a means to provide governance participation to deeply engaged contributors Prevent premature departure of contributors prior to work product finalization  Amounts in the plan will be updated as soon as possible pending feedback from MKR tokenholders and delegates, or not at all if an alternative plan is implemented.  Vesting Details     Property Value     MKR/USD lock-in Price (New) Trailing 6-month average   MKR/USD lock-in Price (OG) MKR = $734.08 (8/8/22 - 2/8/23)   Vesting Period 3 years   Cliff Vest 12 months   Vesting Schedule After the cliff has expired, the monthly MKR amount vests every month   Manual Repricing yes, at a maximum discount of 30%   Auto-Renewal yes   Early Distribution Clause yes   Estimated Max Total team MKR After 1 Year (7 FTE) TBD   Estimated Max Total team MKR After 3 Years (7 FTE) TBD    Early Distribution Clause: As we expect to transition the activities to align with the End Game Plan, offboarding of the Core Unit will result in accrued MKR distributed to all participants who opt into the plan, audited by GovAlpha-001 and SES-001. Manual repricing allows any contributor of SF-001 to calculate a new MKR/USD lock-in price using the trailing 6-month average. This ensures that contributors who join during a bull market aren\u2019t penalized relative to new contributors who join later during a bear market. In order to prevent abuse, manual repricing will reset the 12-month cliff vest period. On average, the team MKR vesting schedule yields TBD MKR per FTE per year, or TBD MKR in total per year.  Payment Implementation The Strategic Finance Core Unit (Steakhouse Financial) will leverage DssVest with a team level vesting schedule, similar to every CU with the exception of PE and GovAlpha, trackable through Makerburn.com. MKR will be allocated from the MKR treasury controlled by MakerDAO. Unallocated MKR will be returned to the DAO. A DSSVest implementation will be created immediately after the approval of this MIP.

Second, I don\u2019t love the new trend of leaving all the actual meat of a proposal out until the RFC period has run down. I\u2019m aware you guys are nowhere near the worst offenders on this front, but it feels like its worth mentioning. The main outstanding questions appear to be:  How much MKR is this likely to cost? Does this follow SES\u2019s formulas to derive MKR compensation using DAI compensation? If this differs from the \u2018standard SES thing\u2019, in what way does it differ? I believe \u2018Auto-Renewal\u2019 and \u2018Early Distribution Clauses\u2019 might be new? Perhaps not though, as I\u2019ve not been following all the budgets recently.  As a more general question for those MKR budgets that include a repricing function (I don\u2019t think this has come up yet?): If repricing will require a replacement DSSVest stream, is there any financial penalty associated with exercising this option beyond the new cliff? The cost of creating executive votes is non-trivial, arguably the cost should be allocated against the contents of each executive spell. ",

If so, that should be explicitly stated in the new proposal.   It will effectively replace it, given the additional headcounts brought on to support the End Game Plan.     LongForWisdom:  Second, I don\u2019t love the new trend of leaving all the actual meat of a proposal out until the RFC period has run down.   This was not and is not our intent, we are seeking feedback from large MKR holders but have not received clarity as of this time. If we do not receive such feedback, we will propose something ourselves.     LongForWisdom:  Does this follow SES\u2019s formulas to derive MKR compensation using DAI compensation?   No - given how low the MKR price is currently relative to our prior plan, it will not use SES\u2019s formulas. If we did, it would result in very high MKR allocations relative to other CUs (higher than PE) which would likely be extremely political.     LongForWisdom:  If this differs from the \u2018standard SES thing\u2019, in what way does it differ? I believe \u2018Auto-Renewal\u2019 and \u2018Early Distribution Clauses\u2019 might be new? Perhaps not though, as I\u2019ve not been following all the budgets recently.   \u2018Auto-Renewal\u2019 is from SES\u2019s plan but will effectively be irrelevant assuming continued MKR holder support of the End Game Plan. \u2018Early Distribution Clause\u2019 is new, and is being brought about by the End Game Plan as SF plans to transition many activities to the future ProtectorDAOs, but the timing is uncertain and in flux given the evolving nature of the plan.
