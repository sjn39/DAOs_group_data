We should make Maker\u2019s revenue recurring and reliable like what banks does when they lend money. I am sure I am not first one thinking about this. What are the obstacles to implement such thing? Can we think of other forms of recurring revenues as well? Thanks ",

Economically this makes no sense unless you have a very small vault and the gas cost prices you out or something. The displayed income dropped for two reasons in my view.  CU expenses(+ Oracle costs? not sure) were added, and are subtracted from the total income of the protocol. Stability Fees have been dropped recently to try to counterbalance the growth of USDC backing.  Revenues of any business will fluctuate with user behavior, shifts in product-market-fit, and other exogenous factors. Finding sources of recurring revenue at scale is definitely the focus of many people here alongside building up a high-quality decentralized stablecoin that the that the world can benefit from. Another potential source of new recurring revenue could be from Oracles, but it is too early to say if it will make sense. ",

The cuts had devastating effects on the sustainability of Maker because no revenue is being collected anymore. The reduction in profit has been so dramatic it is tempting to say it was a governance attack. There was no clear reason to change anything, as Maker was working well and seeing a lot of adoption, and yet we cut rates dramatically and saw no obvious benefits from doing so. It is one thing to seek to grow Maker like a start up, by earning nothing until someday capturing value. But this doesn\u2019t work in a DAO because it creates too much incentive for people to extract value through salaries instead of through growth of value of the coin itself. Currently the expenses of Maker exceed the burn rate, and that should never be the case. Maker should always be getting burned and the P/E should be managed to be relatively low. We should increase the rates until the P/E stops declining. ",

Perhaps not as much due to the drop in earnings but this isn\u2019t the best metric.   The PSM\u2019s growth rate did significantly drop. I will try to find the data but the daily increase in USDC in the PSM was crazy before the rate drop and is far more reasonable now. This was the stated goal of the rate cut: to prioritize removing our reliance on USDC at the expense of profits. That\u2019s what is happening now.   Calling it a governance attack is a bit extreme as well. I think the community has vocal proponents both for and against the rate drop but that\u2019s about it. ",

The PSM has increased by ~250,000,000 DAI outstanding since the executive containing the rate cuts was executed on July 18th. However, DAI from collaterals which had rates cut has increased by ~310,000,000 in that time. Therefore the rate cuts have had their stated effect which was encouraging DAI supply from non-PSM sources and reducing reliance on USDC.  image1601\u00d7861 194 KB  On an unrelated note we need to look at some of these collaterals for potential offboarding, namely BAL, COMP, and UNIV2ETHUSDT Edit: just realised the UNIV2ETHUSDT DC will be set to 0 when the latest executive executes today ",

There was no clear reason to change anything, as Maker was working well and seeing a lot of adoption, and yet we cut rates dramatically and saw no obvious benefits from doing so.   A lower P/E would result in a lower MKR price, currently. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re referring to the \u2018E\u2019 component of the P/E ratio and making the argument that lower stability fee ratios lead to a less sustainable protocol. I would take the opposite view. MKR has been losing market sure to other DeFi protocols who have even lower rates, especially when you consider liquidity mining incentives. So your statement that \u201cMaker was working well and seeing a lot of adoption is factually not true\u201d as the trajectory has been nothing but down since late April. It is not sustainable for MKR to continue losing ETH and WBTC market share.     SCV:  Currently the expenses of Maker exceed the burn rate, and that should never be the case.   Recurring revenues (SFs) exceed forecasted CU expenses by over $10M at current run rates. I would also note that our most serious competitor, in my mind, Circle, is forecasting negative EBITDA through the end of next year but taking stablecoin market share faster than anyone. I would also not conflate the success of a startup with P/E ratio. Look no further than probably the best capital allocator of all time Jeff Bezos who\u2019s ran Amazon at a loss since start up and now is the most dominant force in E-Commerce and Cloud Computing.
