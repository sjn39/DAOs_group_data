Having an interest rate on DAI deposit is a good tool to reduce the DAI in circulation and push the DAI price up to $1. This is unlikely a good idea when DAI price is around $1.01 especially as most DAI are minted against stablecoin (unsure how much interest we will really get from those). Urgent signal rules are the following : In order for the community to make an emergency change to a system parameter a signal request must reach a 50% majority and have a reasonable quorum of voters given recent participation. Currently, the required quorum is 40 voters. Failure to get those 50% majority and 40 votes by Monday will result DSR to be set at 0.25% in an executive. Do you agree to set the DSR at 0% and not equal to the Base Rate? This would be kept until a new signal request or a MIP that change that.     yes no abstain     0 voters     ",
