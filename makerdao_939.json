                    "content": "All - A quick note with some updates. In the interests of transparency, please see the communication I have shared with the RWF team post 6s\u2019 recent closing.  03 April 2022 On behalf of the 6s team, I want to thank the RWF team for your initial review. My objective with this communication is to establish the work that has been completed thus far to allow for a constructive engagement going forward. Further, as a professional courtesy, I want to ensure we keep lines of communication open. Since our last discussion, 6s has closed and perfected the security interest from the Trust down through 6s Capital Partners down to the underlying projects. Further, as a result of this first usage of the credit facility the lion\u2019s share of the concerns that were raised (from our lens) have been addressed as a result. They include:  the conversion of the protected series to a registered series for Series A; implementing the account control agreement; removing the ambiguous language surrounding 6.02(a)(iv) with the consent of the Lender; filing the UCC-1 to perfect the security interest granted under the Security Agreement; receiving a legal opinion that outlines UCC-1 filing for the security agreement not only includes all historically downstream filed UCC-1s but also including all subsequent filings (e.g. all UCC-1s filing in favor of 6s Capital Partners LLC, Series A as a result of us originating a loan are also perfected to the Trust) - Legal opinions issued by Richards Layton Finger, counsel to WSFS and the Trust; built a process to add / remove / replace the Authorized Representative for the CayCo with the Directors of the CayCo; built a process to add / remove / replace the members of an advisory committee with the CayCo  Further, Series B has now been registered with the State of Delaware for another creditor to provide isolation from one to the other (Series C, D, and E will be filed soon hereafter). From our lens, the facility is and was always intended to be a senior secured facility only. The clarifying actions taken above as a result of our first closing reinforce our commitment to this ethos. We have both completed our 2021 annual audit (clean) and have now closed (perfected liens all the way around) on the first usage of our facility and done so with an institutional counterparty to help our client expand. We want to have a collaborative engagement with RWF and MakerDAO as a whole. Our clients are growing, and 6s is growing to meet their seemingly insatiable needs (now exceeding 100MM of projects allocated to 6s Development, to which 6s Capital can, on a competitive-basis, lend to enable those projects). It is my strong desire to utilize the MakerDAO-capital-sourced Series A of the senior secured structure we have assembled to meet their needs. As you know, the current debt ceiling allocated does not accomplish this objective. My goal here is really simple: for this to be a win (for all of us). As a result, we will be requesting an increase in our scope in the near future as we want to expand our lending scope to include non-6s related borrowers. We look forward to engaging with you / the community to allow for the foregoing. Thank you.  To that end and as referenced above and with the consent of the Lender / Trust Sponsor / Counsel to for the Lender / Counsel for the Trust Sponsor, 6s proposed the following to Trustee for the Trust and the CayCo directors:  FROM: 6s DATE: Feb 27 2022 SUBJECT: Credit Agreement - 6S Capital Partners LLC Series A Since we closed the credit agreement last fall, we have discovered a couple of small nits that we would like to clean up before the first closing. We have attached the 2 marked pages for your consideration. The first deletion to the definition of Total Equity is to make clear than all equity of the company is included in the ratio calculations. Inclusion of the word \u201ccommon\u201d was a drafting oversight because we decided to issue both common and preferred equity. The second deletion relates to an ambiguity concerning unsecured loans. It is not our intention to make unsecured loans with the credit facility proceeds. The words \u201cworking capital\u201d could be read to mean this type of loan is permitted and could be unsecured. Both of these changes benefit the lender and neither change impacts the document pagination. We could execute an amendment to the credit agreement but these changes are not material. If you are comfortable with simply making these 2 changes and inserting the clean revised pages into the existing credit agreement without doing a formal amendment, we would be fine with that. Please share your thoughts.  Below are the two areas.  1237\u00d71600 311 KB  1237\u00d71600 358 KB   As a result on March 04 2022, Lender / Trust Sponsor / Counsel for the Lender / Counsel for the Trust Sponsor / 6s all agreed to make the above effective as it only benefits the lender and frankly is only for clarifications purposes. The underlying intent has been since DAY ONE to exclusively utilize the credit facility for senior secured transactions only. No other changes have been made.  1237\u00d71600 343 KB  1237\u00d71600 32.7 KB  Also, in preparation for multiple series and at the recommendation of the RWF team, 6s converted 6s Capital Partners LLC, Series A from a \u201cProtected\u201d Series to a \u201cRegistered\u201d Series.  1237\u00d71600 228 KB  1237\u00d71600 144 KB  In addition, 6s completed the needed account control agreement as referenced below.  1236\u00d71600 397 KB  1236\u00d71600 454 KB  1236\u00d71600 429 KB  1236\u00d71600 144 KB  1236\u00d71600 358 KB  1236\u00d71600 104 KB   As I outlined above and restate for clarity, from our lens, the facility is and was always intended to be a senior secured facility only. The clarifying actions taken above as a result of our first closing reinforce our commitment to this ethos. ",

                    "content": "@mrabino1 - thank you for this helpful update and being responsive to some of RWF and the incubating Legal and Transactional Service core units\u2019 concerns with the 6S Capital legal structure and/or commercial terms. A few initial points for consideration. I will also look back at our earlier inputs to 6S Capital and revert with any additional questions. Deletion of \u201ccommon\u201d from the phrase \u201ctotal common equity\u201d The proposed deletion of \u201ccommon\u201d from \u201ctotal common equity\u201d in the definition of \u201cTotal Equity\u201d is a material change (in favor of 6S Capital) that directly impacts the calculation of the debt to equity ratio in the Section 6.09(a) financial covenant. I understand that 6S Capital will now include preferred equity in the calculation. Can you confirm the ratio of preferred equity and common equity in the total? Any \u201cMaterial Amendment\u201d - which includes an amendment to Section 6.09 (Financial Covenants) - requires the consent of MakerDAO (see (vi) in the definition of Material Amendment in Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement). How did 6S, the Trustee and the Trust Sponsor get comfortable that an amendment to an operative definition used in Section 6.09 could occur without MakerDAO consent? Did the Trustee consider whether Maker should consent to this amendment? Registration of the Borrower as a \u201cRegistered LLC\u201d This is a helpful revision to partially mitigate the bankruptcy risks associated with utilizing a \u201cseries LLC\u201d. To be clear, however, I understand that it remains uncertain as a matter of U.S. bankruptcy law whether this step alone will mitigate the bankruptcy cross-contamination risk created by other \u201cseries\u201d of the Borrower. Did 6S Capital give consideration to any other mitigation mechanisms, separate books and records, separate accounts, etc.? These would be more protective of the Trust (as lender) and ultimately Maker DAO. As the ultimate beneficiary of the loans made to the Borrower by the Trust, it will be better for Maker DAO if the bankruptcy risks associated with other series can be fully segregated (the most effective would be to discard the series structure entirely and have legally separate LLCs). I note that the 6S Capital MIP72 application includes multiple series, so perhaps my questions will be answered there. Amendments to 6.02 Thank you for the deletion of Section 6.02(a)(iv). This is helpful. The revisions to the introductory language do not achieve to narrow the Borrower\u2019s use of funds. As rewritten, the Borrower may use the loan proceeds for any business purpose. This may be considered too broad and open ended. Typically, the lender would seek to have the borrower provide an annual budget of general \u201cbusiness\" expenses against which the borrower may access funds. Was this considered? Creation of an Advisory Committee You mention the creation of an advisory committee. Has this change already been implemented? If 6S Capital has implemented these changes, was it through an amendment to the Trust Agreement? The posting is unclear. Amendments to Credit Agreement in General Thank you for sharing the amendments made to the Credit Agreement and the communication to the respective stakeholders. 6S Capital requested the amendments (as appropriate). Did the Trustee or the Trust Sponsor deliberate in any manner over the substance of these amendments? How did the Trust Sponsor or the Trustee get comfortable - especially on the amendment to the definition of \u201cTotal Equity\u201d - or were they simply following the instructions of 6S Capital? It is important for the Maker community to understand how this process transpired, the role of the respective parties, and who was looking out for Maker\u2019s interests. Could 6S Capital, the Trustee and the Trust Sponsor agree to other commercially-related amendments (both material and immaterial (other than \u201cMaterial Amendments\u201d (as defined)) without the knowledge or consent of Maker DAO? This is a risk that the Maker community may want to address. Thank you again for addressing some of RWF and LTS\u2019s concerns. I look forward to a further feedback on the above. ",

How did 6S, the Trustee and the Trust Sponsor get comfortable that an amendment to an operative definition used in Section 6.09 could occur without MakerDAO consent? Did the Trustee consider whether Maker should consent to this amendment?   We actively called and made a >> request<<. We had our counsel speak with theirs (in Delaware and the Caymans). The view was that the above was not material and in the best interest of the Trust. Rather a drafting error as the numerous posts over the prior 18 months had always indicated that Preferred Equity would be utilized . Further, 6sCP not being able to use the Credit Agreement does not benefit the Trust. As a result of the above and their independent assessment that it was not material and in the best interest of the Trust, the counterparties to 6s made their own decision that it was acceptable. If either had said no, we would not have been able to use the credit agreement. Period     christiancdpetersen:  Registration of the Borrower as a \u201cRegistered LLC\u201d This is a helpful revision to partially mitigate the bankruptcy risks associated with utilizing a \u201cseries LLC\u201d. To be clear, however, I understand that it remains uncertain as a matter of U.S. bankruptcy law whether this step alone will mitigate the bankruptcy cross-contamination risk created by other \u201cseries\u201d of the Borrower. Did 6S Capital give consideration to any other mitigation mechanisms, separate books and records, separate accounts, etc.? These would be more protective of the Trust (as lender) and ultimately Maker DAO.   As a matter of Delaware law, each Series must have its own separate books and records to which 6s will comply. Further each downstream borrowco is required to do the same.     christiancdpetersen:  As the ultimate beneficiary of the loans made to the Borrower by the Trust, it will be better for Maker DAO if the bankruptcy risks associated with other series can be fully segregated (the most effective would be to discard the series structure entirely and have legally separate LLCs).   We have received different legal advice on this point. I look forward to discussing this point with you further to share the insights. Each of our downstream borrowers are each single purpose DE SPVs.     christiancdpetersen:  Creation of an Advisory Committee You mention the creation of an advisory committee. Has this change already been implemented? If 6S Capital has implemented these changes, was it through an amendment to the Trust Agreement? The posting is unclear.   Not implemented yet. The Cayman directors are open to implementing it as well (at our request). That is part of MIP72. There is no change to the Trust Agreement nor the CayCo. This is a political advisory committee at the CayCo (no documentation needed other than the MIP). Neither 6s nor anyone can make the directors do anything they don\u2019t feel comfortable with. The purpose of that committee is to help give additional transactional context. I outlined this further in MIP72.     christiancdpetersen:  Amendments to Credit Agreement in General Thank you for sharing the amendments made to the Credit Agreement and the communication to the respective stakeholders. 6S Capital requested the amendments (as appropriate). Did the Trustee or the Trust Sponsor deliberate in any manner over the substance of these amendments? How did the Trust Sponsor or the Trustee get comfortable - especially on the amendment to the definition of \u201cTotal Equity\u201d - or were they simply following the instructions of 6S Capital?   There were no instructions. There was only a request. I suspect they deliberated as they had questions and wanted to speak to their respective counsels.     christiancdpetersen:  It is important for the Maker community to understand how this process transpired, the role of the respective parties, and who was looking out for Maker\u2019s interests. Could 6S Capital, the Trustee and the Trust Sponsor agree to other commercially-related amendments (both material and immaterial (other than \u201cMaterial Amendments\u201d (as defined)) without the knowledge or consent of Maker DAO? This is a risk that the Maker community may want to address.   No. If they determine in the future that a requested change is Material, then yes, it will require MakerDAO\u2019s vote to approve an amendment. In this context and more broadly for RWA to work, we have to trust people (but verify and have oversight). We have to trust industry experts (regulated ones) that do this for a living (and have insurance for it). I am not referencing 6s, I am referencing a regulated Trust company and regulated corporate service providers in the Caymans that do this everyday. The community needs world-class service providers.
