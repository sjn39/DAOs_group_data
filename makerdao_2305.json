                    "content": " This is a collation of suggested guidelines for the creation of signalling threads. These are currently, and will always be open for debate. Last updated: 15/12/19 - LFW Edit: These guidelines should be considered deprecated, newer more comprehensive guidelines can be found here: Practical Guide to the Signaling Process Signalling Guidelines  If you want to get the communities opinion on something related to current affairs or the future of the DAO, or if you have a proposal you would like to see implemented these are the suggested guidelines for doing so.  1. Use the signaling tag Using the same tag across the forum makes it easy to find all the signaling topics, it helps keep everything organised, it helps the community see if there are things to signal on, etc etc. This is virtually costless to do, please do it.  2. Give the topic a title in the form of a neutral question Giving the topic an appropriate title makes it easy to see what the signal is about. Neutral framing is to ensure that you do not prejudice other community members into voting a particular way. This is vitally important no matter how strongly the author feels about the topic.  3. The topic should seek to gather signals for only a single issue. If you want multiple signals, make multiple topics. This keeps the topic from becoming a confused mess of different conversations. This is not to say that there must be only one poll, only that all the polls should seek signals on the same issue.  4. Original Poster runs the thread. A party needs to both maintain and push a signalling thread to its conclusion (on-chain polling.) This responsibility falls on the original poster of the polling thread. The original popster does not have to remain neutral on the issue, but does need to maintain a balanced summary of the discussion in the initial post.  5. A summary of the essential information and progression of the discussion should be included and kept up to date in the original post. This should take the form of a advantages/disadvantages, pros/cons, positives/negatives to the area being discussed. Disagreements and the reasons behind them should be detailed as they surface within the thread. In order to signal, the community should not need to read through the entire discussion, only the initial post. It is the thread owners responsibility to keep this summary as balanced and succinct aspossible.  6. The aim of a signalling post is to create consensus. When you create a signalling thread, you are trying to gather consensus around a specific proposal, be aware that the proposal may need to compromise to suit as much of the community as possible. The aim is consensus rather than majority-rule, if there is irreconcilable disagreement, the proposal needs to change.  7. Polling Results should be made visible after a vote has been cast. \u2018Show who voted\u2019 should be enabled. People are susceptible to voting with the majority. Conformity bias is a real thing, hiding the results until after someone votes gives an extra incentive for voters to think critically about the issue for themselves. Making votes public after a vote has been cast allows the thread owner to prod dissenting signals to provide evidence-based reasons for their disagreement.  8. Provide a summary of the discussion in the thread and explain any major deviations from the original proposal. This step should only occur after the debate has ended in the thread and there is a sense that consensus has been reached.  9. The proposer should finally post to the end of the thread a completed template for the poll (PR\u2019s are preferred for those who are familiar with git) so the governance facilitator(s) don\u2019t have rewrite or fill in any blanks. This is to avoid the possibility of misinterpretation and to allow the debate participants the chance to vet the wording of the poll.  See these threads: 1 and 2. for a more detailed look at how signaling threads have progressed over time in the past.     Signed and agreed. I disagree with one or more guidelines and will comment below. I am undecided about these guidelines for reasons which I will detail below.     0 voters     ",

LongForWisdom:   Polls should remain open until the poll moves on-chain.    The Foundation needs time to set up the backend for a formal poll and we should allow a buffer between the end of the signal and our ability to promote them externally in the blog, chat, socials, calls. In the near future I can envision a need for additional time so people to do some public \u2018campaigning\u2019 for issues they feel strongly about. We also need the additional time to deal with deadlocks and establish that consensus has been reached. There could be last minute voters that tip the scales or attempt to sybil the forums just prior to moving it to the portal. For the asset priority signalling poll here I set it to end a week before we are scheduled to put it live. ",

Recent discussions/events have highlighted uncertainties in the signaling guidelines. I am looking for people\u2019s opinions, questions or anecdotes around the signaling process. How has the process worked out so far in your opinion? If you think its a silly unnecessary construct tell us! There may be an argument there, who knows? Here the recent discussion centered around whether \u201cfoundation members\u201d should or should not follow the signaling guidelines. The thread states foundation members, but alot of the discussion is in the context of domain teams (who are funded by the foundation). Signal Request: Precedent for on-chain polling Other points brought up by various folk: Should multiple choice polls be required? Is a majority (one option gets over 50% of the votes) or plurality (whatever has the most votes wins) required for consensus in a signaling thread? How should emergency procedures occur?  Everyone probably agrees that emergencies should bypass signaling stuff, what constitutes an emergency, who decides? Is there a spectrum of emergency/urgency? Should different signaling processes accommodate that spectrum Should there be other exceptions to the signaling guidelines? Should we make proposals to streamline governance for specific domains or individuals within domains? Is the signaling process something we believe is worthwhile to keep developing? ",

It should also contain a completed template for the poll so the governance facilitator(s) don\u2019t have rewrite or fill in any blanks. Best to avoid the possibility of misinterpretation. ",

Something akin to a twitter poll that can quickly gauge community sentiment on the subject. Forum polls are great but if you need something done quick what is the best way to mobilize action? Perhaps that is even too slow and we relegate authority to a certain group or entity like we do now. Not sure what the best option is long term. ",
