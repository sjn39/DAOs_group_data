At Bidali we\u2019ve supported DAI since inception, employ people in Argentina and have helped them protect themselves from inflation, and enable people to spend DAI. It\u2019s been a while since we spoke @Nadia, @Jenn and @rune (hello again ). Since 2018 we\u2019ve done a lot of research in LatAm around money, inflation, crypto usage and barriers to adoption. This has included gathering both quantitative and qualitative data via research articles, multiple surveys with thousands of respondents across all ages, genders and wealth, as well as interviews with dozens of individuals (both crypto users and not). The main blockers to adoption are:   The inability to spend DAI directly on common goods and services easily (which we solve, just need more help with marketing & BD);   With such high inflation for so long, many people don\u2019t have spare income to purchase DAI to save if they can\u2019t spend it directly. And even if they do have spare money to save, often it is negligible and the swap fees are cost prohibitive;   Ethereum gas fees make it cost prohibitive to use DAI for real world commerce without sacrificing decentralization, which is critically important where strict capital controls are highly likely. DAI being available on BSC and other faster, lower cost networks or L2s is required. We already support DAI on BSC and support 9 other blockchain networks in our payment tech stack, with more being added. Happy to discuss options here.   DAI is still kind of complex and not as familiar as USD or EUR. If it is presented as USD to the user and people don\u2019t know it\u2019s crypto (like we do in our mobile app) adoption will be better and easier. Needs to be a DeFi mullet that is easy to use but still non-custodial.    Capital controls in Argentina are aggressive and are a bit of an issue, but there are multiple ways to overcome this challenge. The best way is for people to earn DAI directly (so long as they can spend/convert it). Initial subsidies to bootstrap a network effect of P2P, consumer-retail, B2B and business-employee payments in key regions is likely required to kick start \u201chot spots\u201d of a full circle of DAI enabled commerce. We have the tools (and localized in Spanish), we just lack all the resources right now. We\u2019re preparing for a capital raise. Happy to discuss if there is serious interest from the Maker community.  It\u2019s incredibly sad what we\u2019ve seen hyperinflation do in Venezuela and now what we\u2019re seeing in Argentina, Zimbabwe, Turkey and elsewhere. People deserve to have options. ",

Some thoughts around the points you mention (based on my experience as part of the Growth team and as a DAI super user)     ekryski:  The inability to spend DAI directly on common goods and services easily (which we solve, just need more help with marketing & BD);   When we started, this was true, now, cryptocards/cryptobanks have changed the game. They offer the end to end solution with products that look alike other banks, transforming themselves into Fintech solutions and not a niche crypto product. Of course, gift cards are part of the solution,  but I want to point out the amazing work these cryptobanks have done in adoption. And btw, if you are in Argentina, you don\u2019t want to spend DAI, you want to save DAI and spend in ARS, you always want to get rid of the most devaluated currency.     ekryski:  With such high inflation for so long, many people don\u2019t have spare income to purchase DAI to save if they can\u2019t spend it directly.

As you said above, people are looking for solutions or escape from inflation, and they are guided more by simply using the most common currency in these cases is USDT, but let\u2019s remember that currently the population is not fully educated, and there is the opportunity of DAI, teach in a didactic way how to protect your money without falling into the error of using unbacked centralized currencies. For this we can use the growth team to formalize basic cryptocurrency guides sponsored by Maker and DAI, physical workshops since in Latin America the use of cryptocurrencies is increasing due to inflation and this is the opportunity. I give an example of the country where I live, which is Venezuela, despite all the negative news of USDT, it is the most used currency for P2P exchanges, so the idea is to make DAI used organically in P2P trade, thus increasing the common use of DAI and we make more users want the opening of vaults. Even taking advantage of constitutional loopholes or making an agreement with the regulatory body in a country that urgently needs a budget is beneficial for Maker. ",

I have been told that the education barrier is what needs to be improved the most.

We\u2019ve also quietly expanded our relationships globally and have expanded the network support. We have connections to other protocols that are interested in supporting bridging.

Of course, gift cards are part of the solution, but I want to point out the amazing work these cryptobanks have done in adoption.   Also agree. Despite the challenges there has been incredible progress!  The challenge we\u2019ve seen with these structures in general is that Visa/MC and local debit rails have bad FX rates and/or the fees are too high. As capital controls, inflation and capital flight in Argentina gets worse, this issue will also get worse and I suspect that a lot of these institutions will likely be shut down. The government already quashed some of the banks ability to support crypto within 1 day of announcing, because of the IMF pressure. In the long term we see the black market prevailing just like in Venezuela but this means higher costs for users that are a step backward. There are ways around this. Some that are more specific to LatAm but my fear is that most of the blatantly crypto native and centralized firms will continue to face tough challenges with banking and regulations. I would be much happier to be wrong here so please correct me if you think my view is too pessimistic.  There is also some overlap here with the discussions in Cryptocurrencies and credit cards. But for these reasons (and others in the credit card discussion) this is why we\u2019re working on a crypto-native credit card and gift card alternative. Allows us to expand much more quickly and align with the P2P ethos. fwiw our end game at Bidali is and always has been to disrupt ourselves from the inside out. I think value accrual will occur at the protocol, smart contract and token level (if designed right) so our intent is to progressively decentralize and open source the toolset. This is impossible to do with gift card issuers and cryptobanks today and requires completely new technology, thinking and maybe even regulations. Our approach has been to start off regulated and centralized from an operational aspect, in the best jurisdiction we can find so that we earn trust and have an easier time integrating with banks and businesses to help onboard them to P2P transaction flows. If you\u2019re not regulated and there aren\u2019t incentives for banking (the fiat gateways required to use crypto as money today) then it is very difficult or slow to get people into the crypto economy. This is why speculation has been such an important driver, despite these challenges. The opportunity to make large returns offsets the ridiculous conversion fees. But when people come to crypto via speculation, they are much less likely to use it as money. Some do, but it\u2019s a psychological issue due to a bunch of cognitive biases. This is why we think centralization and incentive alignment is initially very important for the money use case, and this is something that Circle and Tether have done a good job at. So while we employ a similar approach operationally (for now), at the same time we\u2019ve been building our core tech as decentralized and P2P as possible. With time, this enables us to begin to open source pieces of the technology bit by bit and enable P2P economies and strong network effects that dramatically improve financial access and raise the GDP of the planet. This is the opposite of Maker which started off decentralized, and has been (arguably) more centralized as of late. Especially with regards to RWA. To me, decentralization only becomes possible at scale and to start off decentralized is much less likely to succeed, especially for real world payments that have to bridge between existing centralized, highly regulated and critical infrastructure. So it requires economies of scale that are directly correlated to the global distribution and diversity of payment network usage moreso than the governance and technology developers. We\u2019ve been very intentional with how we\u2019ve gone about this, from who we raised capital from, how much we\u2019ve raised (very little), who we partner with, and how noisy we are about cryptocurrency (because it impacts the ability to work with brands, banks and even government at this stage). IMHO so far the introduction of most fiat on/off ramps has just added more intermediaries and costs to our financial the system, not less. This is something we are not willing to repeat and why we\u2019ve chosen specific business models that ensure onboarding into and spending with crypto is actually cheaper than the status quo. While there have been some meaningful wins, particularly in countries facing high inflation or that lack adequate financial access, my present view is we are just reinventing the wheel and making our existing financial system worse. Especially since many of the on/off ramps are financially and/or legally obligated to continue with that structure. This is why we have avoided partnering with Visa/MC/PayPal. A bit of a long rant, but hopefully this shares more context around how we\u2019re thinking about things and how it could align with Maker. This is why I\u2019ve come back and been so active as of late. I see how DAI is uniquely positioned to help enable a better financial system, if the path is charted correctly. Looking forward to discussing!  ",

Governments only want their own benefit, talking to SUNACRIP, which is the entity in charge of cryptography in Venezuela, would be a good step so that they at least take into account the use of DAI in government platforms such as PetroApp or increase liquidity in centralized exchanges. pro-government such as CoinCoin X, or only allow talks by third parties or users of DAI or Maker located in the country, only so that the population becomes aware of which is the safest stable currency, it is not a fast path but it is a necessary path.

The cons that I see is the political propaganda that Maker can receive, apart from this the most powerful people or the most successful companies always do business with the good and the bad of the film.
