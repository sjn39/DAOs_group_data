The standardization of stealth address generation holds the potential to greatly enhance the privacy capabilities of Ethereum by enabling the recipient of a transfer to remain anonymous when receiving an asset. By introducing a central smart contract for users to store their stealth meta-addresses (consisting of a spending and a viewing public key), EOAs and contracts can programmatically engage in stealth interactions using a variety of stealth address scehemes. This EIP builds upon EIP-5564 which lays a very minimalistic standard to standardize the usage of different stealth address schemes (e.g. elliptic curve-based, lattice-based, ect). The following repo is used for development:  github.com   nerolation/EIP-Stealth-Address-ERC/blob/main/eip-registry.md --- eip: TODO title: Stealth Meta-Address Registry description: A registry to map addresses to stealth meta-addresses author: Matt Solomon (@mds1), Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter (@nerolation), Ben DiFrancesco (@apbendi), Vitalik Buterin <vitalik.buterin@ethereum.org> discussions-to: TODO status: Draft type: Standards Track category: ERC created: 2023-01-24 ---  ## Abstract  This specification defines a standardized way of storing and retrieving an entity's stealth meta-address, by extending [EIP-5564](./eip-5564.md).  ## Motivation  The standardization of stealth address generation holds the potential to greatly enhance the privacy capabilities of Ethereum by enabling the recipient of a transfer to remain anonymous when receiving an asset.
