My question relates to the 160M USDT freeze last week. (Tether Freezes $160M of USDT Stablecoin on Ethereum Blockchain) I\u2019m just wondering what would likely happen if collateralized USDC was frozen, what is the governance plan? Would we dip into the system surplus to cover? And burn maker if not enough to cover? Possibly freeze the DAI created from the USDC? Lastly, do you think that creating DAI from stolen USDC is actually an attractive laundering vector, or are there much more preferable laundering vectors and so this vector is less likely to actually happen?

The poster also asks about the possibility of creating DAI from stolen USDC as a laundering vector. The post does not fit perfectly into any of the listed topics, but the closest matches are 3rd party asking questions about proposal, 3rd party giving constructive criticism of proposal, and 3rd party extending to proposal.",

Would we dip into the system surplus to cover? And burn maker if not enough to cover? Possibly freeze the DAI created from the USDC?   There is no way to freeze the \u201cDAI created by USDC\u201d because DAI is fungible. We can\u2019t blacklist an address like Tether did either. In fact, this is a distinguishing feature of DAI compared to fiat backed stablecoins like Tether or USDC. If the USDC-PSM is blacklisted by Circle, then yes, the protocol would first use the surplus buffer and then would need to mint MKR tokens to cover the event.     maker_question_asker:  Lastly, do you think that creating DAI from stolen USDC is actually an attractive laundering vector, or are there much more preferable laundering vectors and so this vector is less likely to actually happen?   If you have laundered USDC on an address not blacklisted by Circle, you could swap the USDC for any token you like, say ETH. DAI is not unique in that sense, except that its USD value remains stable. Tagging @makerburn who is the appropriate person to send your kudos to for that website! ",

Lastly, do you think that creating DAI from stolen USDC is actually an attractive laundering vector, or are there much more preferable laundering vectors and so this vector is less likely to actually happen?   DAI token contract doesn\u2019t NOT have the ability to blacklist/freeze addresses (as far as I know).  It is a feature (permissionless). Regarding what would happen if USDC decided to freeze the billions of USDC in the PSM.  Given the total Market Cap of MKR is < such an event would likely bankrupt Maker. This growing USDC exposure (now > 50%) is the reason Maker governance is looking to offboard some of this risk either by converting to USD and buying bonds, or some other methodology to convert this USDC into other liquid assets. DAI from stolen USDC is an interesting possibility (one could consider it a tainting of the entire vault) and given the size of this single vault here a real problem.    Depositing illegally gotten assets into a Maker vault and borrowing DAI has been a concern of mine for a long time, but short of possibly locking such a vault with some governance action (not even sure this is technically possible btw) and eating the DAI loss against surplus not sure there is much Maker can do.
