There is a ton of great info in there, here are the high level takeaways:   Implementation Teams are Committed, But Funding Is A Concern   The Spec Continues To Churn, But It\u2019s Getting Better   Implementation Teams Do Not Push Back Against Researchers   The Definition Of Done Varies From Team To Team   What Comes After Ethereum 2.0 Is Unclear For Implementers   There Is No Ethereum 2.0 Lead   Ethereum 2.0&rsquo;s Narrative Is Controlled By People Outside The R&amp;D Process   OPEN QUESTIONS:   What Does The Community Expect?   Were Implementers Consulted When Designing The Rollout?   Would Making Danny Ryan Official &ldquo;Ethereum 2.0 Lead&rdquo; Help?   RECOMMENDATIONS   Include &ldquo;Product Context&rdquo; In Public-Facing Media   Provide Clear Avenues For Continued Funding   Rigorously Define And Enforce A Formal Standards Process   CONCLUSION: Kyokan, with funding from Moloch and others, is positioned to provide support for the ETH 2.0 effort in the following ways:   Prepare reports and analysis, like this one, to inform the community of ETH 2.0 progress   Evaluate the internal processes of the ETH 2.0 R&amp;D effort   Help develop organizational structure as needed   Assist in coordinating standards across teams   Help plan the development roadmap   Provide launch coordination and prepare clients for production release   Help with developer recruitment   Moloch is positioned to provide support for the ETH 2.0 effort as follows:   Provide additional funding for ETH 2.0 teams   Funding key hires to provide cross-team support   Funding open-source tools (e.g. testing) to help 2.0 development   Definitely read the full thing and share your thoughts! @ameensol @lrettig @djrtwo @mikerah @paulhauner @boris @vbuterin ",

                    "content": "Cross-linking the Reddit thread here. This is a really valuable report and a much-needed (quasi-) third party look at eth2. I definitely agree with several of the assessments:  we need much more sustainable long-term funding embracing existing standards processes is probably a good idea - we discussed this quite a bit as part of the eth1x discussions with some folks at ConsenSys that have experience developing standards the core team doesn\u2019t have control of the public narrative and hasn\u2019t really made much effort to do so - although this indictment is valid of Ethereum in general, not just eth2 the eth2 roadmap is developing well, but it will take longer than many realize for eth2 to reach a state where it\u2019s usable from the perspective of most developers and users. According to Justin it\u2019s 2021 - and that may be a best case scenario. Lots of the details from phase 2 onwards are still very hazy.  One of my takeaways is that, while we should do everything we can to continue to support eth2 research and development, in parallel we should be reinvesting in today\u2019s network (\u201ceth1x\u201d) for a few reasons:  as an insurance policy in case eth2 is further delayed or things go wrong as a source of ideas, innovation, and experience that can flow into and benefit eth2 to reduce time pressure on the eth2 roadmap to increase the value of the eth brand and increase value flowing into the ecosystem, which benefits eth2 as well to explore moonshot ideas that could be promising, such as (one random example) anchoring polkadot\u2019s substrate in eth base-layer security to improve governance and project management  I explored a few more ideas in this thread.
