Be interesting to hear the 6s take on how either of these leads to further DAI collateral centralization vs. decentralization, and how to risk spread with multiple AOs(Asset originators, managers).   Also comments regarding how to manage the size of the problem 3.5B. One thing of note it also might be nice to hear on. What happens if as @rune and others are suggesting DAI depegs from $$ and floats value to either/both of the above. Always appreciated the expensive and hard work 6s did here and the continued engagement with MakerDAO generally. ",

I tossed the idea of allowing a gradual float over the course of 50 years into discord, but others thought that was too long a timespan. I do think it\u2019s in Maker\u2019s (very) long term interest to de-peg, but any rapid action in that regard is going to make it very difficult to bring more collateral onboard, and increases the probability of a fatal bank run.
