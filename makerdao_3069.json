Paragraph Summary This MIP will adapt the open source contract from Uniswap to create a reserve DAI/MKR. It will keep the main method, the swap, remove the fix fees to be changeable via a governance parameter. It will also remove the \u2018share\u2019 token creation as we will be the only owner and modify the add and remove liquidity part to be more direct, accessible only by the governance and fees-less. It will also refactor the flash minting part to be moved out the swap and add a poke call during the update.  Component Summary MIP31c1: Parameter Definitions: List of governance parameters MIP31c2: Functions: List of functions MIP31c3: swap(): Specification for the swap function MIP31c4: deposit(): Specification for the deposit function MIP31c5: withdraw(): Specification for the withdraw function MIP31c6: flashLoan(): Specification for the flash loan functionality MIP31c7: flashMint(): Specification for the flash mint functionality MIP31c8: extra feature: extra feature not linked to any functions MIP31c9: Proposed code: Contains snippet of proposed implementation. MIP31c10: Test cases: Lists existing test cases, including integration tests MIP31c11: Spell: Spell for deployment/install MIP31c12: Security: Comments on the security implications of using CropJoin MIP31c13: Economic / Governance considerations: Discusses insolvency and liquidity risks, governance and example parameters MIP31c14: Licensing: States the license under which the proposal and code are distributed.  Motivation Currently, governance uses the surplus buffer as reserve, but in fact the surplus buffer hasn\u2019t been designed to serve this purpose due to the nature of it. The surplus buffer is meant to be a protocol security reserve for Dai owners in case of failure. Therefore to some extent, It should be considered part of the collateral as it is redistributed to Dai Owner in case of emergency. This proposal aims to add an missing piece to Maker, the Maker Reserve. It is a technical proposal to create a Maker Owner active reserve based on Uniswap V2 AMM. It uses DAI and MKR as asserts inside the liquidity pool. The DAI/MKR will be the trading pair. As a side effect it should bring :  burn process efficiency - swap vs dutch auction more MKR price stability by creating a buffer an important piece for future improvement  small amount Liquidation decrease burning inefficiency Oasis swap onchain oracle etc \u2026 (DeFi is based on AMM)    The AMM on DAI/MKR pair will have a similar effect of the burn mechanism. Instead of burning we will stack 1/2 of MKR and 1/2 of DAI. The module will allow governance to withdraw DAI, MKR or Both. It will be plugged to the keg.  How does it work? The initial deposit (50% DAI,50% MKR) needs to be relatively high to have some liquidity - probably around 1M each. Smaller the deposit is, higher the slippage is. Then the idea here is to divert some % of the DAI from the MKR burning mechanism and redirect it into the AMM. When the Dai is inside the AMM, it will move the MKR price down and create an incentive to buy the MKR against the market. Note, the slippage should decrease when the liquidity increase. ( with 1M Dai inside the AMM and a 1000 Dai put inside we should have around 0.1% slippage) We can adjust the % taken to control the slippage. A small fee is collected each swap and the fee is managed by governance (Uniswap uses a fixed percentage). Although I would advise to match the PSM fee, 0.1% or event less 0.04% as curve. We should not forget that we charge for the DAI inside and MKR was supposed to be burned. Ultimately, I expert the AMM to be more efficient than the dutch auction. Furthermore, we can add more reserve based on Dai. We can redirect small liquidation to it and decrease the dust. We can swap MKR to burn. We can add the swap to oassis. etc \u2026  Specification The overall logic is based on uniswapV2 contract The swap mechanism won\u2019t change dramatically, we will add fee as parameter, a poke() call during the update and non used mechanism will be clean up. mint and burn, will be replaced by deposit and withdraw. The flash minting part will be moved outside the main method to be independent and fees will be setted separately. They will respect the new standard introduced by Sam.  MIP31c1: Parameter Definitions   fees       : percentage of the amount takes as fees for each swap.  flash_fees : percentage of the amount takes as fees for each flashmint/flashloan.  period     : period of time between each poke() call  poker      : pocker contract interface with the poker.   MIP31c2: Functions there are forth external functions :   swap() : uniswap function to swap two token.  flashLoan() : Allow flash loan on the token from the reserve.  flashMint() : Allow flash mint on the dai from the reserve.  getReserves() : To get the reserve  there are five admin functions :   deposit() : to deposit some liquidity or reserve.  withdraw() : to withdraw the reserve.  file(bytes32 what, data) : To change parameters  rely(address contract) : To add authorized address  deny(address contract) : To remove authorized address   MIP31c3: swap()   Three parameters are needed amount0Out, amount1Out, addressTo   Should allow swap between two tokens using uniswap formula.   A fees is taken during the swap amount * fees parameter   Update the reserve after each swap    MIP31c4: deposit()   No parameter is needed   Should be allowlisted.   The call will update the reserve and take into account the tokens send to the contract.    MIP31c5: withdraw()   Three parameters are needed amount0Out, amount1Out, addressTo   Should be allowlisted.   Should be able to withdraw any amount of both tokens.    MIP31c5: flashLoan()   Three parameters are needed receiver, amount, data   Allow flashLoan on the token inside the AMM   A fee is taken, the fee is equal at : amount * flash_fees   The amount is return before the end of the transaction.   Update the reserve after each flashLoan    MIP31c6: flashMint()   Three parameters are needed receiver, amount, data   Allow flashMint on the dai inside the AMM   A fee is taken, the fee is equal at : amount * flash_fees   The amount is return before the end of the transaction.   Update the reserve after each flashMint    MIP31c7: extra feature   poker.poke() is called during the update phase.   poke() sends 5 parameters addressToken, priceDaiCumulativeLast, priceTokenCumulativeLast, daiReserve, tokenReserve, daiBalance, tokenBalance   It is call only if the period after the last call is over.   The balance is updated after poke() is called    MIP31c8: Proposed Code dss-ara  MIP31c9: Test Cases dss-ara test  MIP31c10: Spell ActiveReserveSpell  MIP31c11: Security  Uniswap contract Errors or security vulnerabilities in the Uniswap contract. The contract has been used and well tested.  Contract Modification technical risk In addition to the technical risk inherent to Uniswap contract, this implementation add some risk too. However, due to the design and the separation from the main system, the worst-case losses is limited to the deposited inside the AMM.  MIP31c12: Economic / Governance considerations  Economic risks impermanent losses  Difference between AMM and burn  1/2 MKR and 1/2 DAI are locked vs 100% MKR burn With the AMM, MKR supply doesn\u2019t decrease Due to impermanent losses and the AMM nature, amount of token stacked inside will change depending of the price fluctuation. AMM reserve can be retrieve. MKR burn can\u2019t be retrieve but can be minted again.  Nice plus The Dai reserve increase when MKR decrease which it is probably when we will need the reserve. On the other hand Dai reserve decrease when the MKR increase, but that should not be a problem as we can mint MKR instead.  MIP31c13: Licensing  AGPL3+  ",

In my opinion there is no point adding complexities such as a fund when financing of worthy activities can be achieved by simply siphoning off some portion of the continuous revenue. After we have added a fund we need rules for spending it and someone to sit and watch it and periodically evaluate it. All this is adding complexity. I want the opposite.

This would increase the Maker risk with the MKR price volatility (it is strictly worse than having MKR vaults). Having some DAI on the asset side and almost the same number on the liability side doesn\u2019t have any impact. If we take that road I would go directly to ETH/DAI and ETH/MKR for profitability or DAI/WBTC for business development. The current issue I have with Strategic Reserves (beside not having much time) is that it doesn\u2019t play well with the DAI system. It basically mean you have to pay cash all the asset in the Strategic Reserves. At the same time the world want Maker to live at credit (big demand of DAI). Notice that we can hedge the volatility of ETH by issuing DAI and borrowing ETH with a positive carry (as everyone ants to do the opposite). Basically, we make money by lending DAI vs borrowing ETH and we make money by having a DAI/ETH LP. And the icing on the cake is that it\u2019s a risk free arbitrage if we keep the same amount of ETH on the asset and liability side. But no idea how to blend this concept of balance sheet management with the current Maker system, but MIP31 is probably a first step. ",
