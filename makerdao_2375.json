As soon as the DAI price approaches $1 there is always demand which pushes it back above $1 within minutes/hours. Recent executive votes showed that 0% SF for ETH-A (or the base rate equivalent) is our policy with dealing with the DAI price above the peg. There are no signs that we will see DAI trading below the peg in next few weeks or even months. Why wasting our time on weekly voting and paying rather high network fees when we can have monthly voting or voting when needed if the peg improves (i.e. the DAI price consistently below $1 for 24h). Do you support changing the frequency of the base rate poll to monthly allowing sooner polls if decided by the MakerDAO team?     Yes (monthly poll or sooner if needed). No (weekly poll) Abstain     0 voters     If you generally support the idea of monthly voting then I will make another poll to see what metrics we should use to decide whether we need an extraordinary poll.

It makes sense to give it at least a month to see how it pans out before changing the frequency. I would like to see a process where over time the interval moves from 1 week to 1 month as the system proves itself and DAI remains stable. Going to a 2 week cadence makes more sense as the first step, imo.     psychonaut:  The reason I voted No is because once the peg is fixed (Dai from USDC -> 0), overshoot to the other side is likely.   I agree with this too, this probably isn\u2019t the right time to be making cadence changes. ",
