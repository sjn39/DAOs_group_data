He and other market participants have colluded to force a shutdown before the threshold is raised to 100k, this is less likely because he borrowed originally 40k  and paid back 16k after that, it\u2019s disconcerting that he can borrow 40k on his own. I feel that new 100k MKR threshold for the Emergency Shutdown Module is also to low. Those are my thoughts, maybe you have a more reasonable explanation.  image1363\u00d7236 18.2 KB  ",

Or something similar. @rune in his Sagittarium Engine proposal, suggested to increase the voting weight of people locking for a long time (beside other benefits). This is very much needed. Somebody proposed in the Maker chat to talk to Aave/Compound to limit the MKR-borrowing options. But I seriously doubt this type of approach will work (medium/long term) in DeFi, which is an open environment. What we need are better tokenomics/incentives, for MKR holders to do the right thing.
