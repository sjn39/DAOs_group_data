                    "content": "About a year ago, on April 21st 2021, New Silver minted the first 380k DAI backed by real world collateral with MakerDAO. This wasn\u2019t just a first for Maker, or a first for Centrifuge \u2013 it was the first time a real world asset was used as collateral in a decentralized lending protocol. A big congrats and cheers to everyone in the Maker community that\u2019s been involved so far. A special thanks to @prankstr25, Kirill of New Silver who saw the vision for RWA in crypto long before many others did. Kirill\u2019s journey started much earlier than last year, before Multi Collateral Dai was even on testnet. In early 2019 we started working together with the Maker Foundation and did a first transaction financing a first home on Ethereum Mainnet with Single Collateral Dai in August 2019. From there we\u2019ve been through many iterations on the governance process and New Silver is now at 16M DAI minted. With this growth comes more improvements we\u2019ve all been working on together: a legal setup based on an indenture trust that will be another key milestone in scaling RWA in Maker as safe and scalable collateral. The real world impact of decentralized finance is one of the fundamental ways for Maker to grow and I\u2019m excited about all the groundbreaking work we\u2019re doing as a community. It took us 10 years to get from Bitcoin to DAI. I believe we can take less time than that to get DeFi involved in all of our financial transactions. Thanks to everyone helping to bring this vision forward! ",

New Silver\u2019s resolve on bringing real estate asset to DeFi is even stronger than it was a year ago, and we know that the entire world of finance is watching (I get 1-2 calls every week from companies asking questions about this, and I take the time with everyone to explain). We are also very excited to help innovate and mature the offering, and work within the RWA framework  set out by #rwf-001 . We believe in Maker\u2019s vision for addressing the 3 corners (Stability, Decentralization and Scale as outlined by @teej ) in order to serve the very large RWA (or real estate in our case) market. We are thankful for the past, and excited about the future together. We will continue to be work hard to communicate, improve, innovate and grow. ",
