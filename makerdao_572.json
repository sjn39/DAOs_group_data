USDC and Tether are still seeing more volume, but the gap has been narrowing week to week. DAI currently represents just over 15% of all assets moved to Avalanche over the past seven days.  Dai bridged to AVAX824\u00d7444 28.1 KB  Slowly chopping away - all without a 70+% commercial paper backing. Outside of the network\u2019s three money markets, the consistent flow of liquidity has brought on several quick rises and declines. This week\u2019s benefactors were Platypus Finance and Sushiswap. Platypus describes itself as an \u201copen liquidity stableswap protocol\u201d, offering high stablecoin APYs on deposits in much the same way the Orion Money operates on the Terra LUNA network. We all know Sushi: after a slight rough patch, the protocol rebounded hard, showing a 34% increase in TVL last week. There\u2019s not much else to say, so luckily the total says it for me: AVAX houses over 701 million Dai - an 18% weekly increase, and good for around 7.18% of the total supply.  Current Events  Avalanche Summit in Barcelona from March 22nd through the 27th    Binance Smart Chain Another week passed with very little movement showing on-chain, posting a percent change in circulating DAI lower than 0.00%\u2026 again. The 261 million Dai dictated by the BSC network represents 2.68% of the total supply.  Current Events  BSC joins Alian\u00e7a Portuguesa de Blockchain, a non-profit association composed of several large corporations and law firms.    Fantom  FTM net flow726\u00d7437 12.9 KB  That\u2019s a lot of green\u2026 and green is good. Fantom has seen explosive growth in the new year, posting overwhelmingly positive net inflows every day last week. The movement saw Geist steady the ship and begin to extend its gap with the competing money market, SCREAM. This can primarily be attributed to the rise of Yearn Finance and the 20+% stablecoin APY it offers on the network. SCREAM relies heavily on high deposit APY\u2019s to offset its sub-par lending rates (an area Geist does very well in) and is unlikely to be able to match Yearn\u2019s offerings. That said, the Yearn team recently announced that SCREAM would be heavily featured in its FTM \u201cstrategies\u201d, theoretically benefiting both protocols in the long term. Fantom now holds roughly 376 million DAI or 3.9% of the total supply.  Current Events   Shopping.io to integrate with FTM Mainnet. ALERT TO MULTICHAIN USERS    Polygon Not too much changed in the MATIC ecosystem, but money has continued to pour back in - nearly across the board.  Polygon DEXs919\u00d7475 60.8 KB  Balancer maintained its hold on Dai movement through Poly DEXs, but the competition is heating up - and a lot of DAI is being moved on numerous platforms. As a whole, Polygon currently holds over 453 million DAI, good for 4.6% of the total supply.  Current Events  With the announcement of Plonky2, zkSNARKs are coming to Polygon    Layer-2s   The L2 Overview   Arbitrum Like Optimism, Arbitrum is an optimistic rollup. They\u2019re optimistic in that any validator can post a block of transactions they claim to be accurate, while still providing the remaining validators ample opportunity to dispute a block if it\u2019s suspected to be fraudulent. Unlike Optimism, Arbitrum offers an entire suite of dapps ranging from Ethereum ports to native projects. That said, the top protocols aren\u2019t exactly new names.   Curve | 365mil TVL  Sushiswap | 350mil TVL  Abracadabra | 311.37mil TVL  But, native projects have been showing a healthy dose of growth as more and more users opt to explore Ethereum scaling solutions. In total, Arbitrum plays host to over 34 million DAI, a 60.5% quarterly increase.  Aztec Aztec is a zero-knowledge (zK) rollup being marketed as the \u201cEthereum privacy layer\u201d, raising over $17M in its Series A. Though its efforts haven\u2019t translated to much DAI movement, Aztec has arrived.   twitter.com    Aztec @aztecnetwork  Aztec Connect, the first private bridge for Ethereum DeFi, is live on testnet.  Up to 100x gas savings with fully private transactions by default.  Private DeFi is here. https://t.co/d7RedFHmIK   1:45 AM - 10 Dec 2021           1.5K                320            Not long after, the team announced a community-led grants program, which aims to provide support and resources to developers looking to build on the network. So while growth has been slow, like NEAR, it\u2019s also been methodical. Time will tell, but Aztec is one worth keeping an eye on this year.  Optimism As noted last week, for the past month total Dai circulating Optimism has been off by around 10 million Dai. For full details, see this thread. Major props to Protocol Engineering for consistently going above and beyond. Now, moving on to the network itself - Optimism has had some growing pains. New and existing dapps have been slow to port, allowing Synthetix, Uniswap, and Lyra to dominate the bulk of the market. Still, Optimism now holds around 28.8 million Dai, representing a 2.87% quarterly decrease.  Loopring Loopring is one of several competing zKs, and like its competitors - is very much still in the prototype phase. While several are working on offering the full-functionality available on Optimistic rollups, they\u2019re currently best suited for simple transactions. Loopring.io can be used to bridge to the network, farm, and provide liquidity. The L2 only holds around 617k DAI, but as the quarterly growth shows, that could change in a hurry.  zkSync As you\u2019ve probably guessed, zkSync is another zK rollup competitor. Like Loopring, its only offering is its native bridge and DEX, Zigzag. That said, our focus is on DAI, and to this point - zkSync has managed to attract a lot more of it than the competition. Over 3.2 million Dai has been bridged to the L2, good for a casual 127.4% quarterly increase.
