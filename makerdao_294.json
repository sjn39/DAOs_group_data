                    "content": " General Updates  EthOnline 2021. As mentioned in previous updates, we want to re-appear in the grants scene, to have devs create on top of the Maker Protocol. EthOnline is the first hackathon we sponsored this year, and although we suggested ideas of what we wanted these hackers to build, the projects that applied for our grant didn\u2019t do anything related to that. Instead, they were focused on using Dai as a stablecoin integrating it with superfluid to add streams into their idea. These are the winners of the Maker prize:  Osmotic Funding distributes funds to gitcoin Grants from a pool of DAI based on their votes from the gitcoin token holder community. MoNa, The project wants to bring cryptoeconomic/defi/game theory to the world of judging and interactions whit NFT. Unstoppable Streams is a decentralized live streaming solution, with tickets as NFTs, streamed payments via super tokens, video NFTs from live streams, tips to creators, and random prize giveaways to stream viewers.  And our learnings of this process:  There are a lot of new devs coming into the space because of NFTs. Interacting with the Maker Protocol is hard for new devs. If we want them to do something different than integrating Dai, we need to create more guides for new devs and be closer to them during the hackathons. Having a dev-advocate during the month of the hackathon is essential to onboard them on Maker. We need to participate in more hackathons, It is not just a branding good practice. It also helps us interact with the ecosystem and let them know how they can collaborate with us.   BanklessDAO We started working with BanklessDAO, the writers guild, to create press releases for Maker\u2019s most important announcements. Once we have the press release (which is also posted in the BanklessDAO Medium), we distribute it to various media outlets to inform them about what is happening in Maker.

                    "content": " General Updates  Before the updates: if you attended the maker mixer event in Lisbon, reach out to us to send you a poap    Improvements for the launching process of a new product. Because of the nature of our mandate, where the goal is to help the ecosystem integrate with the Maker Protocol, we have identified the need to improve the onboarding of a new collateral process (new product). These improvements will help us increase awareness of what\u2019s happening in Maker and, at the same time, will tighten our relationship with our partners. The process to onboard a new collateral -or a new product from our partners PoV- is divided into the following stages:   Review and Agreement.  Using Long\u2019s spreadsheet, we can understand what\u2019s coming next. The list gives us the upcoming executives, helping us define the products to come and their impact on the Protocol. To give everyone a practical example of how we envision this process, let\u2019s take the latest product launch during the last week, where we onboarded stETH and the D3M to the Protocol.  Internal Coordination.  Although we have forum posts describing these new products, we need to create content that will explain to our community and partners what these new products mean for the Protocol and its impact on the ecosystem. During this stage, we work with @Protocol-Engineering , BanklessDAO, and the @happiness-core-unit  to create to explain the new products. For the D3M launch, @hexonaut created a tweet thread, Growth created another one, and Strategic Happiness worked in a meme. The idea is to bring different explanations of what the D3M is and to reinforce the message.  Partner Awareness  GrowthCU will reach out to various DeFi integrators to explain to them the upcoming collaterals. In this stage, GrowthCU will support Maker\u2019s partners in integrating the new collateral and with the messaging or adoption campaigns to help them reach their audience with the new product. As some of these integrators are DAOs, we will also be presenting proposals to their community if needed.  Market Awareness  Depending on the stage of the executive, we defined different ways to communicate the new product to the community: To post as soon the executive goes live:  Crypto memes to generate expectation, through defidegen Twitter account  To post after the executive pass and the collateral goes live:  A general explanation of what it is, through MakerGrowth Twitter threads Description from the PECU PoV, through a PECU team member twitter account  To post after one of our partners integrated it to have a UI to the new product:  BanklessDAO article Partner\u2019s awareness campaign  We will constantly be improving this process and trying to find new actors that could help us increase the reach we currently have (like a PR agency). As always, any suggestions are welcome!  MakerGrowth twitter metrics report Without access to the MakerDao website, blog, and Twitter account, the MakerGrowth Twitter account is the medium we are using to communicate with the ecosystem. We started posting in June, but since July, we have been following a content schedule and a tone to engage with our audience. We use our Twitter account to explain what\u2019s happening in MakerDAO, educate people about about crypto, DeFi, and MakerDAO and to announce the latest actions with our partners.
