As of this writing, I believe that would be approximately 96.79 DAI/MKR/year (i.e. (87,823,980 DAI annual revenue) / (907,351 MKR outstanding)). I realize this is very similar to P/E ratio, but given our emphasis on burning, I thought EPS might be nice. \u201cIf you had one MKR, this is how much it would return per year.\u201d I also like earnings per coin more than P/E ratio because it removes MKR price fluctuations from the equation. Barring large increases in expenses, earnings per coin generally ought to only go up as DAI supply & revenue increase, and as we burn MKR. A chart of earnings per coin over time might be neat, too.

Your site presently contains the collateral types RWA001 (6s Capital) and RWA002 (New Silver - through Centrifuge). First of all let me tell you this list of Real World Asset collateral types is only going to grow and you might put them on a separate list sooner rather than later. Second, maybe without realizing it you have just created the Coinmarketcap of Real World Assets in crypto. You could keep adding RWAs and then you could maybe add the eventual RWAs of our dear competitors as well. This will likely create some mild irritation and spur action in the community. Edit: can you maybe add what is done with RWAs over at Centrifuge as well? So we have NS-DROP which is the Maker part and then we have the New Silver DROP and TIN info from the Centrifuge site. Adding that info to Makerburn would make it much easier for us to see if something is out of order or mispriced. ok? ",

If the countdown was based on the lerped limit, it\u2019d be a pretty useless graphic constantly showing ~0-1 \u201cdays to go\u201d or \u201cbuffer full\u201d. The graphic (like its label states) does not show \u201ctime left to burn\u201d, it shows an estimate of how much time we will spend accruing system surplus given the current system state. Also, I think just showing the lerped limit would be misleading. Fact is that we will be spending about 30 weeks building surplus and people should be aware of this. The reason some people interprets the graphic right now as \u201cno burning for 209 days\u201d is because the buffer target was raised and burning stopped. We have a history of just completely stopping burn for long periods of time, so it\u2019s not surprising people are quick to jump to this conclusion. Personally, I think it\u2019s really unfortunate that a batch of expenses was pulled at the exact same moment buffer target was raised resulting in a couple of days with no burn. Hopefully, the restarting of partial burn in about a day makes it more clear that we\u2019ll still be burning for the time being. ",

On the main page Dai supply total and  MKR price blocks have two side arrows in the top right corner that go to the line graph showing progress over time for corresponding asset. At the same time System surplus, Annual profit estimate and MKR tokens burned so far do not have these arrows. It takes some clicks to find information about progress over time for above three values. Besides that users need to know that there is such data on the website (not everyone is aware). I think, for consistency reasons as well as for easier access to information, would be good to have two side arrows on all of them and link each of them to corresponding graphs. So that:  Dai supply total <-> makerburn.com   System surplus <-> makerburn.com  Annual profit estimate <-> makerburn.com  MKR Price <-> makerburn.com   MKR tokens burned so far <-> makerburn.com  Recent changes <-> makerburn.com    ",

Thank you for the hard work and care put into this. Something I\u2019m always having to do is look at the vesting totals and subtracting out the unclaimed portions of it to understand the true state of the surplus buffer and treasury.  Would it be possible to add some kind of surplus buffer counter that considers the vesting expenses.  I think this would help with understanding the true rate of growth for the surplus buffer rather than the way it slowly rises and then loses a big chunk randomly when some CU claims their income.  I don\u2019t really know what to call it some kind of projected surplus buffer? I think the accrued vesting values should also be used to calculated estimated profit rather than projecting based off actual expenses.  But I get that there are one off expenses that need to be considered.  This could be another category on top of vesting expenses?  I know these are kind of big changes but wondering if others also think it would make sense to do things this way.  I\u2019m mainly looking for more transparency in the actual state of mkr and makerburn is a highly visible part of the protocol. ",

We hear from SF that CUs have in total about 15M DAI on hand (at last report) and since this is just a total of the DAI still in CU multisig wallets it should be an easy add. So it would be nice to see a chart of this CU DAI on hand over time and to have on the \u2018profitability\u2019 a button to add or remove this from the \u2018net expense\u2019 total which would ofc also affect bottom line.

Also I think when it comes to profitability the ability to add this to the revenue calculation (and the ability to control what goes into that in the calculation page as well) on the profitability graph would also be very useful . Since if I take the numbers I am seeing there it doesn\u2019t match at all the DAI expenses listed on the top level.  -47.5M, where as the above page 55.8-16.7  image749\u00d7317 19.7 KB   image944\u00d748 1.75 KB  Point here is that a more accurate number is more likely to be that 55.8M-16.7M =39.1M for CU expenses than the 48.1M that is the actual paid as a real expense run.   Also note that 39.1M is a pretty different number than 55.8M or 48.1M and it would significantly adjust the profitability line on the front page. The 48.1M is the Bugdet expenses - Requested by CUs The 39.1M is the actual budget expenses as measured both by Expenses - CU DAI left in multisigs. Which brings up a question how is that expense line defined?  (not clear to me)  Which brings up an additional point to think about.   Putting up definitions for each of the columns that can be clicked on so people can look up how the line items are calculated.  I like to see this info as a link on the text itself that can take the user to the specific entry on a sitewide info/definitions page but your call as to how to handle that. Thanks for the snappy reply btw.    Nice to see the DAI still held by CUs and see that my 35-40M actual run estimate is more realistic than the 48M and growing. ",
