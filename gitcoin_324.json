Aside from the coverage of proposals (for free users), we now provide rich on-chain and off-chain analytics for Gitcoin for Pro & Enterprise users. This includes:  Delegate metrics: voting power breakdown, their voting power growth over time, and recent voting activity   1600\u00d71041 215 KB   DAO community engagement metrics: lifetime voters and average voter participation rate   1600\u00d7807 129 KB   Proposal metrics: lifetime author counts, counts of proposals in a given timeframe as well as average proposal pass rate   1600\u00d7765 120 KB  Any feedback is welcomed and we would be happy to chat about other services we can provide (ex: quarterly reports, governance analysis and overview). Hoping the community finds these metrics valuable  ",

One thing I really like is the link to see the governance forum posts that are tied to different on-chain proposals.  Screen Shot 2023-02-17 at 1.15.59 PM975\u00d7219 29.7 KB  A lot of interesting discussion takes place here and I feel like it\u2019s often missed by the community or less active members of the DAO. With that being said, I think it\u2019d be awesome to see this section displayed more prominently on the page for each proposal and maybe have a \u2018preview\u2019 or \u2018TLDR\u2019 of the related post. Also having a forum section w/ recent posts listed on the DAO homepage would be awesome for directing community members here. Let me know what you think! ",

The Governor team does our best to provide a TLDR summary for each proposal. The goal is generally less than 300 words. The reason we don\u2019t cover all the recent forum posts is because our scope is to only track governance discussions/proposals that will go to an off-chain or on-chain vote. However, we have an aggregated view of all Gitcoin proposals that you can see here. ",
