                    "content": " Emergency Response Spells There are several actions in the Maker Protocol that MKR Holders and delegates can take via an executive vote that are implemented immediately, without waiting for the GSM Delay (timelock currently set to 48 hours) to expire. These actions are primarily in place to give MKR Holders a chance to mitigate a potential emergency, something that is often not possible if they can only act on a 48 hour delay. This post contains some thoughts and tentative recommendations on this subject.  Part 1: Predeployment In most cases, MKR Holders must wait for an actor (normally the Protocol Engineering Core Unit) to deploy an executive spell containing the required solidity code to trigger gsm-exceptional actions. Given the required response time on some types of emergency (primarily related to oracles), it may be beneficial to pre-deploy a set of emergency response spells. There are several points in favor of this approach:  It may reduce emergency response time, especially if delegates are made aware of their options in advance of an emergency situation. It may allow technical personnel to focus more on determining which response is optimal in an emergency rather than implementing said response within a strict time window. It may reduce the chance of an error in emergency response smart contract code, as it has been written and reviewed outside of a time-critical situation.  There are also some potential downsides:  The cost in technical resources to implement and maintain a set of Emergency Response Spells. It encourages \u2018shotgun\u2019 style responses. For example, it\u2019s likely we could pre-deploy and maintain a spell to freeze all oracles, it is less feasible that we could pre-deploy and maintain a collection of spells to freeze each oracle individually. It increases the risk of social engineering attacks (or good old-fashioned self-inflicted hysteria) on the Recognized Delegates.   Thoughts on Hysteria risk The combination of short time windows, and the difficulty non-technical users have in directly viewing the state of the blockchain in a decentralized manner gives rise to a non-negligible risk of Emergency Response Spells being triggered outside of an emergency situation. Given  The severity of a successful attack The (usually) minimal impact of triggering an emergency response unnecessarily The low likelihood of this happening, especially if mitigations are developed, and delegates are made aware of the risk ahead of time  I do not believe this new risk is likely or severe enough to dismiss the idea of pre-deploying emergency response spells.  Shotgun Responses The risk of \u2018shotgun\u2019 style responses can be strictly limited by technical personnel in a given emergency response situation. Assuming communication is taking place, and time windows are known, a situation-appropriate response can be constructed. If time constraints require action, the shotgun response can be used, otherwise, a more targeted response spell can be deployed. Pre-deployment, therefore, increases options in an emergency situation, without removing existing options, and should be viewed as a positive.  Cost in Technical Resources My understanding of the exceptional functionality is that it is generally simple and easy to trigger, requiring a handful of method calls at most. This reduces the spell-writing and review footprint for technical personnel. Further, such spells should at the very least last a year before upgrades or additional functionality requires their replacement. This does depend on the area being covered, with some spells likely able to remain unchanged for longer, and some needing more frequent replacement. Regardless though, this will require technical resources that may be deployed elsewhere, at a time when many changes to the protocol are being proposed. Ultimately, I suggest that the cut-off as to what (if anything) is worth creating and maintaining is left to MakerDAO\u2019s technical teams.  Suggested Candidates GovAlpha tentatively suggests that Emergency Response Spells be pre-deployed to take the following actions. Notes  These are listed in order of perceived importance. This list has been generated prior to discussion with other Core Units. I hope that PE, Oracles, and Risk can comment their thoughts, highlight anything missing, or provide reasoning as to why these are not required. This list only contains items for which a faster-than-GSM response is already possible.  Candidates   Universal Oracle Freeze - Freezes all active oracles.  ETH Oracle Freeze - Freezes just ETH oracle.  BTC Oracle Freeze - Freezes just BTC oracle.  Universal Liquidations Breaker (Level 3) - Freezes all liquidations.  Universal D3M Breaker - Withdraws Dai from all D3M implementations.  Specific D3M Breakers - Withdraws Dai from a specific D3M implementation.  StarkNet Breaker - Prevents minting of Dai on mainnet that originates on the StarkNet L2.   Part 2: Expansion of GSM Exceptions While creating the GSM Exceptions documentation, and this post, we noticed a number of items that do not have exceptions, that potentially should. We list these here. More so than the previous section, we would appreciate input from other Core Units and delegates as to what should be covered. GSM Expansion List   Universal Debt Ceiling Freeze - Prevents any new Dai being minted.  ETH Specific Debt Ceiling Freeze - Prevents any Dai being minted against Eth.  BTC Specific Debt Ceiling Freeze - Prevents any Dai being minted against wBTC.  Specific PSM Liquidation - Liquidates a specific PSM.  Implementation of these will likely require a larger investment of technical resources. Both with creating and deploying the appropriate contracts, and determining the attack vectors that each new exception represents. Absent opposition on the grounds of safety or utility, GovAlpha would like to see these exceptions implemented, and Emergency Response Spells pre-deployed.  Part 3: Emergency Response UI Finally, if emergency response spells are pre-deployed, they should be easily accessible via the official voting UI, in a similar manner to the Emergency Shutdown Module. Unlike the emergency shutdown module, the flow for triggering a pre-deployed spell is identical to the existing voting flow. This may reduce implementation time in any UI development. A new section on the site and a list of executives displayed in the current style (complete with copy) would be sufficient. At a minimum, the voting portal already provides functionality to vote on an arbitrary spell address, which can be used to vote for Emergency Response Spells if their addresses are widely publicized in advance of an emergency.  There is also the question of whether this approach ought to be voted on by token holders in MIP form or whether these decisions should be left to technical and/or governance teams working within MakerDAO. This is another question open for discussion.  Tagging relevant parties: @Protocol-Engineering @Oracles-Core-Unit @Risk-Core-Unit @Recognized-Delegates ",

This contract serves a dual purpose as both a factory that allows anyone to quickly and permissionlessly deploy a spell with a single purpose of dropping a plan (ex. executive spell) from the governance pause when time is of the essence. It also acts as a heavier hammer in the case of a governance attack, the Protego contract itself can be lifted to the hat, whereupon it acts as an IAM that will allow for the permissionless dropping of any scheduled plan from the Pause. Further discussion, described above, is needed for determining what, if any, additional resources like this should be constructed. ",

In my own understanding, a governance attack is possible if an attacker has only enough MKR to be able to lift a malicious spell in the MCD_ADM contract. If that happens, the Protego contract can only be lifted if the attacker does not have 50%+1 of all MKR that is locked in the MCD_ADM. Even with a smaller amount, we might end up in a situation where \u201chonest\u201d MKR is scattered supporting different previously valid spells, so there is simply no way to lift the Protego contract. In this case, we\u2019d need to incentivize MKR holdres that currently are not locking their tokens in the MCD_ADM to actually participate in the governance process in a timely fashion. Am I right in this? ",

In the case of a broader governance attack this helps in the case of \u201cdelegates were sleeping\u201d, and a malicious majority slipped through.
