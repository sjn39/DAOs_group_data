We have started working on what we hope is an intriguing solution with a relatively quick implementation time that we think will benefit all participants in the Ethereum network. It will help miners as we will reward them to host chains. It will help developers control the chain, its rules and its governance. It will help users participate directly in chains that are smaller and can be downloaded to a phone. We have been working on formalizing our full thinking in this specification. We are also working on a POC to demonstrate how this can be practically implemented. Your thoughts and reviews are very appreciated. ",

                    "content": "Yes, you are correct. It\u2019s similar in principle, however, there are some fundamental differences between the two. First of all, the Polkadot model is PoS based and also implies a certain degree of inherent connectivity and necessary cooperation between individual sidechains. While Canto presents a similar approach from a high-level, the intent is to provide a practical solution that can be easily implemented in a manner that requires very little additional re-architecture or development of the existing Ethereum protocol. The Canto model is still POW based, but the subnets are logically isolated from one another and responsible for their own security and function. Assuming that a subnet is stable and consistent, we can also assume that its own transactional processing would be retained within that particular environment, thereby reducing the computational overhead required by POW on layer 1. To further expand on this notion, transactional activity on layer 1 would be limited to the result of very few actions, including subnet creation, subnet destruction, participant entry, and participant exit. This optimization could dramatically reduce the total amount of POW transactions, allowing anyone to participate as a miner without the need for commodity hardware. The next point of difference would be that Canto\u2019s design principles place an emphasis on consent, choice, and sovereignity, so long as the integrity of the primary layer is preserved. Each subnets has the ability to dictate its own terms of engagement. Interoperability between subnets is a choice. Consensus mechanisms are a choice. The act of joining a particular subnet, multiple subnets, or any subnet at all is a choice. The staking mechanics provide an insurance layer between the subnets and the primary EVM and also help contol liquidity. For example, if some sort of experimental system chose to build out on a subnet, they can choose to implement whichever consensus algorithm or protocol they choose. Since the ephemeral nature of the subnets allows them to be rapidly constructed and deconstructed, the participants would still be able to experiment in a safe environment. If some sort of security issue were to present, the existing subnet could simply choose to rebuild itself as a separate subnet, similar to a forking event, however, the users would only have to change the network ID in the subprotocol to make the switch. From a more practical perspective, if an ICO were to choose to build on a subnet, they would be able to very quickly provide utility or at least an MVP. While the microeconomics of the subnet itself could be affected, the results wouldn\u2019t be nearly as adverse as they would be within the present system, but most importantly, because of the staking mechanics, the effects would be limited to the subnet and its participants and preserve the integrity of the primary EVM. Since the subnets are logically independent, the operations of each have no impact on any other, unless they choose to interoperate via cross-chain bridge. There\u2019s a lot of additional details we\u2019ve discussed and are eager to share, but I\u2019ll spare this post of further elaboration for the sake of brevity. Your feedback and critique is much appreciated. ",

It wouldn\u2019t require much additional development on the protocol layer. Based on my experience, cross-shard tx communications rely on more complex pub/sub epidemic broadcast trees. I think these decisions can be made at the subnet level so long as they don\u2019t effect the mEVM.     tvanepps:   wouldn\u2019t ASICs just absorb this new revenue source? or, for example, could ProgPow be implemented on a subnet?    Sure, this is a possibility, but it shouldn\u2019t make much of a difference because the real value should come from POS incentive mechanisms, which anyone can participate in. Since the miners would be further incentivized to stake their rewards, it would create a more robust insurance layer. Subnets, on the other hand, can choose to implement any consensus mechanism they see fit. There\u2019s certainly more to think about on this subject though, but the idea is to get a scalable solution out the door quickly without the need to rearchitect the existing system.     tvanepps:   Could an account send ether to a subnet have a sub-address created and then that ether (in the form of sub-net tokens) be deposited in a single transaction? and then actions signed from that previous address?

Would you mind elaborating?   I\u2019m now remembering in the spec that this requires an oracle to trigger the transfer function from the subnet contract to the subnet address. meta-txs basically allow you to signal from an empty account that you need tokens in order to transact and then a separate contract fulfills that. Austin would have a more accurate description. I guess these mechanisms would be papered over for someone just looking to play a quick game or something. they won\u2019t really know that their ether is being held in a separate contract and that they are actually using a subnet with subnet tokens\u2026 etc etc     zscole:  We decided to go with the term subnet because it was easier to understand in relation to existing networking terminology.

There should\u2019t be any merge mining, so they\u2019re not operating on the same chain.     tvanepps:  I\u2019m now remembering in the spec that this requires an oracle to trigger the transfer function from the subnet contract to the subnet address. meta-txs basically allow you to signal from an empty account that you need tokens in order to transact and then a separate contract fulfills that. Austin would have a more accurate description. I guess these mechanisms would be papered over for someone just looking to play a quick game or something. they won\u2019t really know that their ether is being held in a separate contract and that they are actually using a subnet with subnet tokens\u2026 etc etc   Oh! Yeah, this makes sense. We actually discussed a function similar to this, but didn\u2019t really detail it in the paper because that\u2019s something more complex that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to provide immediately.

Would you probably publish your ideas and in particular the RLPx extension on ethresear.ch?
