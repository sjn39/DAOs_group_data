Not only could you submit whatever proposals you want, but also would you be responsible for 25% of passing any other proposals. One person should not have a quarter of the power of a multi-billion dollar defi project, especially in its early stages as the community lays the foundation for future success. I am offering my opinion, because I think the community is drastically uninformed, possibly even among seasoned crypto enthusiasts. I also think that if you want to be involved directly with submitting proposals, then you could benefit from spending some time reading the Uniswap GovernorAlpha contract, so that you can grasp how the proposal submission process works.

The reason I didn\u2019t put any liquidity into the UNI-ETH pool is because I don\u2019t want to lose any of my UNI to impermanent loss, which is already happening as the price of UNI rises much faster in relation to ETH.  UNI is such a special case being the native token of the platform.  While it might help to offset some of the impermanent loss by earning UNI in such a pool, personally, I\u2019d rather just keep my (tiny bit of!) UNI out of any pool for now, and hold on to it, and use it to vote or delegate down the road. Does UNI in a LP still allow the wallet voting rights, with the current set up?  Should it? ",

We will incentify people to focus on farming more uni and inflate the market, rather than focusing on building and innovation in defi sector. I want for the uni to go up in price because Uniswap brings a lot of value to the defi space rather because of inflatory degen strategies.

They expect the money they earn from trading fees to be greater than the impermanent losses they suffer from price movement. Users are happily providing millions of $ in liquidity with no incentives, throwing money at them without needing to is a waste. Also, while UNI/ETH liquidity is nice for token holders, it brings basically 0 value to regular platform users and traders. The currently incentivized pools (DAI/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and WBTC/ETH) increase overall platform liquidity as bridge assets. Eg. if a trader wants to use uniswap while consolidating profits to BTC or stablecoins, the availability of a deep WBTC/ETH or USDC/ETH pool will help them access all of uniswap\u2019s other liquidity with less slippage. Liquidity for UNI token is basically a bridge to nowhere, as it only helps those buying or selling UNI and not the platform more generally. ",

I\u2019m sure the same happens with others learning on their own but actually understand it unlike myself. What I am trying to get at is that I have yet to gain any UNI at all whatsoever. I have purchased some off of coinbase about a week ago or less. And I decided to take it upon myself to make attempts at gaining some UNI by joining the pools n whatnot but as I said I had no clue what I was doing. But I will say at one point, I did end up somehow having a deposit of ETH for a small amount end up in my wallet and though I was doing something right. I was doing that exact pair ETH \u2194\ufe0fUNI just assuming that was the way to do this.  Fast forward a couple hours, my coinbase wallet had no more of both those coins, and on top of it I thought I would be able to import what I have combined as a pair upto that point,  but nope, those were nowhere to be found either. SMH\u2026my point is, does it sound like I should just kind of give in and maybe attack (not maliciously) cryptocurrency from a different angle such as maybe the aspect of margin trading or something. The problems is that my OCD just won\u2019t let go of the fact that I\u2019m struggling to understand the basics and especially considering the amount of research I do I feel I should get it much better,  and so since I feel I don\u2019t as of now, it eats me up and  makes me really want to just understand it even more and to the fullest capacity one can understand. I\u2019d even be satisfied with a small knowledge base and not necessarily have to go that far which probably would be impossible for me anyhow. Sucks because I just want to comprehend it on a level of confidence. Do I sound crazy rn?! lmao I\u2019d love to hear some feedback and by anyone. Thank you in advance! ",
