                    "content": "The past few weeks have seen the weekly Base Rate poll continue to vote in 0% while the peg remains above $1. This is problematic because it undermines the core promise of Maker in exchange for compensating MKR holders for risk. I am urging MKR holders to consider voting in a negative Base Rate to help restore the peg to $1. As a reminder, voting in a negative Base Rate does NOT imply that any Stability Fee will end up negative. The Stability Fees are defined as: Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + Risk Premium, 0%) For example, if we vote in a Base Rate of -1% then ETH-A\u2019s Stability Fee will be: ETH-A Stability Fee = max(Base Rate + ETH-A Risk Premium, 0%) = max(-1% + 0%, 0%) = max(-1%, 0%) = 0% since 0% is greater than -1%. There is nothing special about a Base Rate of 0% other then it is the point where MKR holders start subsidizing the risk premiums, but we are already doing that with ETH-A anyways. If your concern is to be compensated for the collateral risk exposure, then I urge you to reconsider as growth and trust of the protocol is of paramount importance at this stage. I don\u2019t believe it is worthwhile to be concerned about earning a 1-4% risk return on the current Dai supply when we could be looking at billions (trillions?) of Dai being issued over the next decade. It is very common for start up company shareholder\u2019s to be tolerant of all sorts of risk at the beginning because the dominant risk is almost always that the product will fail altogether. I know we are a DAO, but I think the analogy works. Anyways, this was a bit of a rant. I hope I changed some minds, but if not please explain why you want to keep the Base Rate at 0%. ",

Resistant to hyperinflation due to its low volatility, Dai offers economic freedom and opportunity to anyone, anywhere.\u201d that\u2019s in the first paragraph from the MakerDAO whitepaper That\u2019s a promise made by MKR holders to the world. It\u2019s currently not fulfilled. If the world want broken promises they can go to USDT. Yield farming is stretching the peg. The current \u201cyielding\u201d collateral is USDC and it is used by COMP farmers. USDC will be the more impacted by a negative base rate. It would mean giving those farmers more yield. Yet, this is the way. We need more farmers borrowing DAI on USDC directly or, more likely, more people arbitraging between USDC vault and compound/aave DAI supply. COMP farming ensure the DAI utilization on Compound will be above 75% usage for next months leading to a minimum 2.72% supply interest rate. If the stability fee from USDC goes below that (effects will start before), it\u2019s an almost risk free arbitrage. If the supply interest rate on money markets stay higher than other stablecoins for a foreseeable future, the peg will continue to be broken. No issue buying DAI at 1.03 if I can lend at 9% versus 2% using USDC. Interest rates have an impact on exchange rates. At the current stage, MKR holder have a earning yield of almost nothing (0.4% if I remember correctly). that\u2019s not different from 0%. The system surplus is thin anyway. What matter is being trusted on our promises. Yield farming with DAI is a blessing, every farmer is exposed to our product. Let\u2019s show us we deserve to serve them in the future. 0.1% SF on the amount of DAI in 10 years will be mush more than anything missed this year. But being an alt-stablecoin will not earn much that\u2019s for sure. I completely get the PSM argument. I want that too. I said (and still believe) that using stablecoin as collateral is crazy. But the whitepaper doesn\u2019t promise MakerDAO to be clean and perfect, it promises the peg with the dollar and low volatility. There is one easy tool to do that => base rate below 0 (notice that stability fees will not go below 0 in any case). ",
