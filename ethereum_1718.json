                    "content": "On December 1st 2020, the launch date of the Beacon Chain, the price of 1ETH was $582.44. This means that becoming a solo validator cost $18638.08. Right now the price sits at $2,861.09, which requires $91,554.88 to participate in the proof of stake mechanism. What\u2019s the point of making it possible to run the blockchain on consumer hardware when nobody will do it at home anyway because they will be a part of a validator pool? Of course you can still run a node altruistically, but I doubt there are many such cases. What if the price of ETH reaches $10,000? $50,000? I would like to understand why keeping the value at 32ETH is a good idea for the system. ",
