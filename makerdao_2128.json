                    "content": "So we\u2019ve been recently been discussing the possibility of uniswap liquidity tokens as collateral in this thread, for more context on why this may be valuable and isn\u2019t obviously risky, feel free to read over that thread.  Reasons to include the Eth-Dai liquidity token Personally, I think the Eth-Dai token would make good collateral for the following reasons:  Being able to use it for collateral incentivises the uniswap-v1 ETH-DAI pool, this is beneficial as it allows people to trade Eth-Dai with less slippage. It is more valuable to hold when ETH is trading sideways rather than upward or downward. This makes it more likely actors will wish to use it for leverage when they expect no major change in Eth price. It is the largest liquidity pool of the discussed uniswap liquidity tokens at just under 6 million dollars worth of assets and it is the 3rd largest uniswap liquidity pool overall.   Application Form 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @LongForWisdom 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token Uniswap is a decentralized Constant Product Market Maker that operates entirely on-chain with no admin tokens. There are two user groups, the first: traders use uniswap to swap one crypto-asset for another. The second: liquidity providers who provide liquidity for traders in exchange for a small fee on every trade. See https://uniswap.org/docs/v1 for more details. 3. Provide a brief history of the project I\u2019m going to leave this for someone else to provide. I\u2019m not 100% sure how relevant it is for this particular collateral type and I suspect that most people are aware of uniswap. 4. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the system(s) that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematic(s) are especially appreciated. Whitepaper: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf Docs: https://uniswap.org/docs/v1 Code: GitHub - Uniswap/v1-contracts: \ud83d\udc0dUniswap V1 smart contracts 5. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. Consensus Dilligence: Uniswap audit. We are proud to announce that we have\u2026 | by Sergii Kravchenko | ConsenSys Diligence | Medium Runtime Verification: verified-smart-contracts/uniswap at uniswap \u00b7 runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts \u00b7 GitHub 6. Link to any active communities relating to the project. Discord:  Discord Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSwap/ 7. How is the applying collateral type currently used? To the best of my knowledge the uniswap liquidity tokens are not used by any other protocols directly. There are a number of dashboards that display the amount available, and some apps for calculating profit, but otherwise these appear to be a largely untapped resource. 8. Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? No organisation bears legal responsibility for the collateral. Dai, Eth and the uniswap tokens are all permissionless. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? I am not aware of any markets for the ETH-DAI uniswap liquidity tokens outside of uniswap itself. Uniswap allows redemption between liquidity tokens and the underlying assets at any time. By definition, there is always the required liquidity for this redemption. 10. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Has the project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. No 11. (Determined by Legal Domain Team) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. No 12. (Optional) List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed Collateral type. Not sure. I suspect the best way to go about this is to have oracles report the prices for the underlying assets and then get the ratio from the uniswap contract. 13. (Optional) List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed Collateral type. No parties that I know of, though I suspect that anyone willing to bid on ETH collateral would also be willing to bid on ETH-DAI liquidity tokens. ",

The token is a standard ERC20 that does not have any centralization risk. I have a couple of concerns about risk, but maybe not insurmountable.  Where would oracles source token prices? Maybe this can be derived from existing oracles and pool size, it\u2019s an open question. Where would keepers source prices? There\u2019s not a liquid market for these, so the assumption would be that a keeper would need to either hold or remove liquidity from the pool to recapitalize. What about Uniswap V2? As far as I know, Uniswap will upgrade to V2 and replace the frontend. Uniswap V1 will continue to live forever on-chain, but the future of the V1 ETH/Dai pool is uncertain at this point. How could flash loans in and out of the Uniswap pool affect the Maker Protocol? It might not, but I haven\u2019t fully thought this consideration out. What are the possible issues, if any, of having Dai partially backed by Dai? Again, there might not be any, but we want to think that through and be sure about it.  I\u2019m not too concerned about the fact that this is an ETH and Dai derivative. I myself hold ETH/Dai in uncertain markets, and I think that because it\u2019s a more stable asset than ETH alone it might attract more interest in sideways markets. ",

Maybe this can be derived from existing oracles and pool size, it\u2019s an open question.

There is no key uniswap frontend, and most uniswap trades do not originate on the official uniswap UI. Uniswap V1 is already integrated into several liquidity systems including Kyber and 1inch. Uniswap-V2 is uncertain, and I\u2019m bearish about it because the amount of liquidity required to generate volatility-based volume is substantially larger because there is no unifying collateral (eg ETH), and because it uses substantially more gas.

I\u2019d love to see ETH/DAI right away but relying on on-chain data could potentially create issues if the pool is unbalanced via a trade. This is similar to what happened with bZx a couple of months ago, so we\u2019ll probably need to work with Nik to get an Oracle stood up that medianizes the pool balances over time. It\u2019s not anything insurmountable, but it will take a little engineering to do it right.   Would love to know what the next steps are and if there is any room for community involvement. Is this just an issue of development work and capacity given the current circumstances? Do we need a separate discussion for how to properly build a uniswap oracle? ",

                    "content": "Oracle Team Collateral Onboarding Evaluation V1.0.5 Author: Niklas Kunkel (Oracle Team) Contributors: Date: 05/13/20 Explanation of the Oracle Team Collateral Onboarding Methodology Economic Impact How much Dai can be expected to be generated against UNI-V1-DAI? Concrete Data: Token Contract Address: 0x2a1530C4C41db0B0b2bB646CB5Eb1A67b7158667 Circulating Token Supply: 22,791.80 UNI-V1-DAI Token Market Cap of Circulating Token Supply ( TMC ): $10,067,385.90  Current ETH Balance of Pool = 25,340.52 ETH Current DAI Balance of Pool = 5,020,821.36 DAI  Total Number of Holders: 841 Token Distribution: Top 20 holders hold 86.02% of Circulating Token Supply Avg Collateralization Ratio of Maker Protocol ( avgCR ): 361.38% Assumptions:  Assume a reasonable minimum collateralization ratio ( minCR ) based off empirical values in collateral portfolio. Since this token has exposure to ETH which has a collateralization ratio of 150%, let\u2019s assume minCR = 150%. Market Cap Utilization ( MCU ), the amount of the TMC that can reasonably expect to be deposited in the Maker Protocol, is bounded by empirical values in collateral portfolio (e.g. [0.55%, 2.74%] ) Currently the lowest and highest MCU in the Maker Protocol are [0.73%, 3.73%]   Formulas: Estimated Lower Economic Impact = TMC * MIN(MCU) / avgCR  Estimated Lower Economic Impact  = $10,067,385.90 * .0073 / 3.6138 = 20,336.47 DAI  Estimated Upper Economic Impact = TMC * MAX(MCU) / minCR Estimated Upper Economic Impact  = $10,067,385.90 * .0373 / 1.5 = 250,342.33 DAI  Due to the limited amount of Dai that is estimated to be minted for UNI-V1-DAI the Oracle team is labeling this as Low Economic Impact Given the distribution of token holders relative to the total number of token holders, how many users with significant sums of the proposed collateral are we reasonably targeting with this integration? ~20 people Technical Complexity Determine how complex integrating Oracles for this collateral type would be and how long it would take to implement such a solution. Is a solution currently not possible because of a key missing component? The Oracle stack doesn\u2019t currently support Feeds querying data from the blockchain. Are there enough high quality data sources available to construct a reliable, resilient, and secure Oracle for the proposed collateral asset? No. Using the Uniswap API would be completely centralized and allow complete manipulation of the Oracle. The better alternative of using on-chain data is not currently supported. Can the current tooling support the types of data sources that are needed? No, see above. Can the current tooling support the types of data modeling that are needed? There is an active discussion in the Oracle section discussing the potential Data Model for UNI-V1-DAI. This model is not currently implemented in the Oracle tooling. Does adding these features interfere with ongoing or planned development of new tooling on the Oracle Team roadmap? This feature is already on the roadmap. What dependencies (both technical and system), risks, costs, and latency are added to the Oracle Protocol as a function of these added features? Getting blockchain data would require Feeds to run their own Ethereum node or subscribe to external services. Running a node adds complexity to the Oracle stack and introduces a new point of failure. It also would significantly increase the costs of running a Feed. Increasing costs while keeping compensation the same would negatively impact the security incentives for Feeds. Subsriving to an Ethereum node service like Infura would work but now has a centralized trust-dependency on Infura who could censor data intentionally (or unintenionally if the service goes down which it has in the past). All of these problems are solvable, but require extensive R&D. Does adding these features require work from other stakeholders such as the Smart Contracts Team(s)? No. How long would it take to design, implement, test, and deploy such a solution? About 2 months to develop and test. Given the R&D work involved to add support for blockchain data in a secure and reliable manner the Oracle Team considers this a high technical complexity project. Evaluation The combination of Economic Impact mapped against the Technical Complexity of onboarding a new collateral type can paint a picture of whether an Oracle Team ought to accept, decline, or defer a collateral onboarding application.      Low Technical Complexity High Technical Complexity     Low Economic Impact maybe decline   High Economic Impact accept maybe    Low Economic Impact x High Technical Complexity => decline Reccomendation UNI-V1-DAI looks like a very interesting token in that it enables market-makers of Uniswap V1 to generate extra yield. That being said, given the current supply of UNI-V1-DAI tokens, the amount of Dai that could be expected to be generated is exceedingly low. Due to the current limitations of the Oracle tooling, creating an Oracle that meets our quality standards for reliability and security is fairly difficult. These limitations are not unique to UNI-V1-DAI but extend to all classes of tokens that require verifiable on-chain data. Advanced tooling which can support this functionality is on the roadmap for the Oracles. The combination of low economic impact and high technical complexity to implement an Oracle inclines the Oracle Team to decline this collateral type at the present time. Once the supply of UNI-V1-DAI has grown and the Oracle stack has been updated to include the necessary functionality, the Oracle Team will consider revising the reccommendation. ",

                    "content": "Some other factors to consider regarding Nik\u2019s post,  Instead of assuming minCR = 150%, a 130% CR or lower is reasonable. Uniswap LP tokens have less volatility than the underlying. A 130% CR is similar to a CR of 169% on ETH-A. Market Cap Utilization could be higher than 3.73%, Uniswap LP holders would generally be more aware of the Maker ecosystem and vaults. ETH-DAI LP tokens should have a SF discount, partially crediting the DSR to DAI held as collateral. It makes sense for LP tokens to use DAI vs CHAI/cDAI/aDAI because there\u2019s more trading volume on DAI, and less fees to unwrap. Now by adding the SF discount this is another economic incentive for LP tokens to be used as collateral when in a high DSR environment. And you don\u2019t lose on-chain liquidity in a high DSR environment.   ETH-DAI SF = SF - 0.5*DSR = (Base Rate + Risk Premium) - 0.5*DSR   The Economic Impact of adding LP tokens is not just from increased DAI minting. DAI LP tokens also have a big impact on the DAI Stablecoin Ecosystem. LPs add DAI liquidity to the ecosystem, adding a lot of utility to DAI. There\u2019s a possible snowball effect, with more liquidity (less slippage), more adoption, more trading volume, more liquidity.  Also some network effects with Uniswap V2, more ETH-DAI liquidity, possibly more pairs using DAI as a spoke. This is also a governance decision, whether the economic impact is high enough.  Some explanations on the 130% CR and SF discount.     [UNI-V1] Uniswap Liquidity Tokens as Collateral Collateral Discussion       So if you used a 130% CR for the DAI/X pair. You\u2019d be protected from a -40.8% drop in X, equivalent to X having a collateralization of 169%. (If X drops by 40.8%, the DAI-X Liquidity Token drops by 23.1%)  DAI/X CR of 125% = 156% CR of X  If you want a formula CR of DAI-X = 1 / [ SQRT [ 1 / (CR of X) ] ]  CR of X = 1 / [ [ 1 / (CR of DAI-X) ] ^ 2]  But it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that to decide on a collateralization ratio. There\u2019s the liquidation penalty, slippage assumptions\u2026         [UNI-V1] Uniswap Liquidity Tokens as Collateral Collateral Discussion       For some further discussion on risk parameters: the stability fee on ETH-DAI Liquidity Tokens.  So one interesting thing is that DAI is being minted while partially backed by non-DSR DAI. That DAI sitting as collateral is earning stability fees for Maker from another vault.  The ETH-DAI liquidity token includes 50% DAI. And with a 130% collateralization ratio, each DAI minted is actually backed by 65% DAI.  So it seems important to give a stability fee discount for this vault. 50% is conservativ\u2026     ",
