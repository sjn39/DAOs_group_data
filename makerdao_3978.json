                    "content": "Background The idea is to replace the current DSR Rate governance poll with a new poll that asks for the DSR Spread instead. The DSR Spread governance poll gives us the DSR Rate by taking the weekly MCD Global SF Rate and subtracting the DSR Spread. MCD Global SF Rate - DSR Spread = DSR Some examples: MCD SF voted as 4% DSR Spread voted as 1% DSR will be 3% MCD SF voted as 10% DSR Spread voted as 3% DSR will be 7% See this thread for a full discussion: Request for Adjustment to DSR Phrasing I will summarize the pros/cons below: The Negatives of Switching to a DSR Spread  Increased Cognitive Complexity  If you want to think in terms of absolute rates then it makes sense to keep things the way they are.   Adding Low Volatility Assets  If we end up something like SAI as a collateral type, then we will likely not be able to impose the global stability fee on those assets. Example) Borrowing DAI from SAI makes no sense on any rate other than 0%. Note: This could be countered by setting a negative vault fee that follows the exact negative of the global SF.  EDIT apparently we can\u2019t do this according to the dev team.    The Positives of Switching to a DSR Spread  Reduction of Weekly Votes  By switching to a DSR Spread vote we will only need to vote on the MCD Global SF Rate every week to affect peg stability (+ SAI SF Rate before migration ends). This is because the DSR and Global SF Rate perform analogous actions in terms of peg stability. One increases DAI demand whilst the other decreases DAI supply. DSR Spread will likely only need to be voted on every few months as it does not affect peg stability.   Simplification of What Each Vote Means  Currently raising the DSR and the Global SF do the same thing for peg stability. It is not clear what the community thinks when these numbers are both changing week to week. Is the peg off of $1? Do we want to incentivize more users with a higher DSR? Answering these questions is currently not clear. By switching to DSR Spread we use the Global SF to manage peg stability and the DSR Spread to manage system growth speed vs profit taking to MKR holders.   Remove the Possibility of a DSR mistakenly being higher than the Global SF.  So even though it\u2019s not entirely clear whether this situation is desirable or not, there are some weird incentives that come up when we run the DSR > Global SF. As vault creators can earn an interest rate with their collateral from this scenario. This would be similar to running the SCD SF rate at a negative value. By making the DSR Spread >= 0% as a limit (same as we do with the rates), we can remove this from accidentally getting added to the executive.    Proposed New Poll Option The poll would use the exact same rate stepping as the current DSR poll except it will be used to determine the DSR Spread instead of the DSR with an optional lower bound of 0%. The DSR will be calculated as: DSR = max(Global SF - DSR Spread, 0) (the max() prevents the case where the DSR is negative) Note: This wasn\u2019t explicitly stated when I originally wrote this post, but currently the MCD Global SF is 0% during migration and we are emulating it via the ETH-A, BAT-A vault fees. It is my assumption that we will begin using the Global SF instead of the vault fees once migration is over, but perhaps that wasn\u2019t clear to everyone. This is not a mission critical change for migration, so I think we can wait until migration is done to proceed with the vote.     Yes, switch DSR voting format to a DSR Spread with a lower bound of 0% Yes, switch DSR voting format to a DSR Spread without a lower bound of 0% No, keep the current DSR absolute rate vote Abstain (I want to see results) Abstain (I have no opinion) Abstain (I don\u2019t feel I am knowledgable on the subject) Abstain (I disagree with the poll options) Abstain (I have a different objection)     0 voters     This is a multiple choice poll, vote for  everything  you are willing to vote for in an on-chain vote. Poll results will be reviewed on  January 7th, 2020  ",

We should use vault fees to capture risk premiums. EDIT: To elaborate a bit. This is related to the negative point about \u201cAdding Low Volatility Assets\u201d. If we end up adding a SAI-like collateral type such as US Treasury Bonds or something we run into issues where the overall stability fee may price that collateral type out. As an example: Why would you borrow against SAI at any rate other than 0%? I\u2019m personally still thinking on this point, but I don\u2019t think it is a problem for now as it is still hypothetical. EDIT 2 I think I am starting to understand the objections. It is my view that for DAI peg stability we should not care what the total fees are for individual collateral/vault types. There are only two things we should care about for peg stability: dai demand (DSR) and overall collateral pool supply (global sf). If you treat all collateral types as a homogeneous pool which backs supply then by raising and lowering the global sf you raise and lower that supply without caring which collateral types go up and down the most. Right now we have ETH fee = BAT fee = 4% and SAI = 0% but once we get SAI out it should look like global sf = 4%, ETH fee = ETH risk premium and total ETH SF = Global SF + Vault risk premium. You can think of it like a central bank interest rate to encourage/discourage economic growth. They set it across the board instead of setting it for every asset. Does this clear things up? ",

It\u2019s not a migration critical piece, and we are jam packed with migration-specific stuff right now.     psychonaut:  If we add USDC or TrueUSD or similar as collateral then the global SF is never going to deviate much from zero, ever. Perhaps the weighted average SF is a better reference point when thinking about the DSR.   I\u2019ve given this some more thought, and come up with four points:   Is low volatility collateral (TrueUSD, USDC, etc) even something we want in the collateral pool? What is the user base for this collateral type? I\u2019m not convinced there is one for USD-analogues. There is perhaps one for something like US Treasury Bonds which is very stable, but not pegged to $1 USD. How big is the demand for something like that though?   If we do want to add a low volatility collateral type we are going to have to make a choice of whether we want to subsidize the collateral or if we are okay with pricing it out when the global sf is increasing. Why would we want to subsidize more borrowing behaviour during a bull market (when SF is increasing)?     For example if we are in the depths of a bear market and the global sf is 0.5%. It may make sense to suddenly enable borrowing against some relatively stable, non-correlated asset such as US Treasury Bonds which only makes sense to borrow against at these rates. Once we start reaching another bull market and the global sf starts increasing again we want to discourage those borrowers. That\u2019s the point of the stability fee raise. Maybe we don\u2019t want any low volatility assets being borrowed at that point.   If you look at the overall goal of encouraging/discouraging borrowing in aggregate for peg stability, it may end up being okay if we price out these low volatility assets during bull market behaviour.     As LFW said, we can always make these the exception to the rule and subsidize them via the DSR by running a negative vault fee. EDIT apparently we can\u2019t do this according to the dev team.   This low volatility collateral argument has pros/cons to both absolute DSR and relative DSR spread. I believe it is a discussion worth having, but I believe it is a separate issue to this vote. If for whatever reason low volatility assets start becoming a big part of the collateral pool and it makes sense to switch back to an absolute DSR then we can always reverse this decision. For right here right now though I firmly believe the DSR Spread is a better voting parameter for the current pool allocation.   ",

Oh that\u2019s good to know. I\u2019ll update the post. Regarding the inability to subsidize low volatility (LV) assets during times of a high Global SF, I\u2019m still wondering why we would want to be subsidizing borrowing during times of excessive borrowing. It makes more sense to be pricing these assets out to do the exact opposite. ",

The SF would be okay, but if we generate DAI with 100:1 leverage then the DSR would be forced toward zero.   No wait, this can still work if we set a huge SF for stable collateral. Consider the following transaction flow:  Random wealthy woman Alice wants to transfer $1 million USD to DAI Market maker Bob opens a Vault using $10k TrueUSD and creates $1 million DAI (1:100 leverage). The $1 million DAI are sent to Alice (on chain) in exchange for $1 million USD (off chain). Maybe there is an escrow account inbetween. There is a 400% SF on the TrueUSD Vault, not because there is much risk of liquidation, but to cover the potential cost of a 4% DSR on 1 million DAI. (We probably don\u2019t even need a price feed for DAI/TrueUSD. We can just assume it is 1.0 always with an emergency switch to liquidate all Vaults.) Bob is incentivized to close the Vault ASAP and places a 1 million DAI limit buy order on Oasis. As the order is filled, Bob pays down the debt on the Vault. Once the Vault is fully repaid then Bob\u2019s $10k TrueUSD capital is free for the next trade.  It\u2019s a risk transfer:  Alice transfers $1 million USD to 1 million DAI with pre-agreed slippage/fee paid to Bob. Bob needs to estimate how long it will take to buy 1 million DAI on Oasis and the corresponding SF liability.  There is probably a similar transaction sequence to go from DAI back to fiat USD, but I haven\u2019t worked it out yet. ",

There may a global RP for all collateral types, as well as collateral specific RPs. Both are included in \u201cRP.\u201d I think there has been some laxness in the community with terms\u2026 but this is my understanding of it. A Vault user might say: \u201cWow Vaults are so attractive, but I\u2019m scared of the interest rate volatility\u201d so they say \u201cI will enter into an FRA/SWAP with a DAI user so my DSR stays flat\u201d But then they need to take care of RP. So they find an insurer. The insurer says \u201cI think the risk profile will not change so I can insure this vault user\u2019s RP\u201d But then they say \u201cI want nothing to do with the DSR! Its too volatile!\u201d Now if we say that DSR is a percentage of SF, the insurer can\u2019t offer this policy to the Vault user because the RP fluctuates with respect to the DSR So the DSR spread makes sense (very much so I should add!), but DSR as a percentage of SF not as much because it interlocks DSR and RP and they become dependant variables. This makes it more difficult for insurers to offer policies for RP. It is best to keep the various components separate to make them easier to hedge. Its harder to hedge when two components are mixed together. Side note: if you want more explanation of this \u201cFRA/SWAP with a DAI user so my DSR stays flat\u201d See the attached file [Where OC stands for Over-collateralized Vault.] It represents a hybrid between FRAs and IRSwaps that Vault and DAI users can use to bring their DSR exposure to exactly neutral cFRA750\u00d7500 61.6 KB  ",

It is my view that we should encode RP entirely into the vault fees and use the global fee as the only fee for peg stability. In summary: Vault Fee (What the Vault owner pays) = Global SF + Vault RP The DSR is paid as some fraction of the Global SF. If DSR Spread = 0, then MKR holders take no profit. If DSR Spread = Global SF then MKR holders take all profit. I like this model for a few reasons, but one of the main advantages is that it completely separates risk (Vault Fee) from peg stability (DSR / Global SF). I made a presentation for Thursday which will hopefully clear up some of these terminology differences. Happy to hear alternative models as well. ",

DSR doesn\u2019t matter much to vault holders (or insurers) unless there also Dai holders, but even then the Dai would probably be invested else where.  Who would take out a 4% loan just to put it in a 3% savings account, long term. DSR would not be link to risk of individual vaults but to the GSF, which is the baseline risk of all collateral. With reasonable debt limits a sudden spike in demand to mint and sell a Dai shouldn\u2019t happen. A general outflow of liquidity from the all crypto markets would increase the interest rates and spreads of all stable coins. A FRA would be useful in this situation and we wouldn\u2019t need to increase each individual vault fee (or even the DSR spread), we would just raise the GSF with raises the DSR, which would be cover by an FRA on either rate. What I think your example is: Person A) Vault owner has 100 ETH wants to take out a 5000 Dai loan at 4% (3% GSF + 1% VF) to buy a 6% corporate bond maturing in one year Person B) A Dai holder wants to lock in DSR at 2.85% for one year Since DSR is link to GSF, any increase in GSF would in increase DSR. Making a FRA for DSR somewhat interchangable with a FRA for GSF. So person A makes FRA for DSR with Person B for one year. Person A has GSF is locked in but not VF. Person A could find someone else to enter into a FRA for only VF. However since VF rate is calculated based on the risk nature of the asset (volatility, liquidity, average collateralization) this shouldn\u2019t change much compared to other similar assets. A put option or a leveraged short position on ETH, could cover ETH price drops. If person A was not mildly bullish on ETH (and there for the stability of ETH VF), they may be better off to just sell ETH, buy the bond, collect a clean 6%, and buy back the ETH after a year. ",

This seems like enough evidence to move to an on-chain governance vote. Following @LongForWisdom\u2019s format here, I\u2019ll write up a description for @rich.brown to add to the voting portal.  Title: Should we replace the weekly DSR Rate governance poll with a weekly DSR Spread governance poll? Description: If passed, the weekly \u201cDai Savings Rate Adjustment\u201d governance poll will be replaced with a weekly \u201cDai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment\u201d governance poll. The \u201cDai Savings Rate Spread Adjustment\u201d poll will use the same exponential rate stepping options as the other governance polls with a lower bound of 0%. The Dai Savings Rate Spread will determine the Dai Savings Rate by using the following formula: Dai Savings Rate = max(Dai Stability Fee - Dai Savings Rate Spread, 0) (the max() prevents the case where the Dai Savings Rate is negative) Background and discussion: Signal Request: Should we replace the weekly DSR Rate governance poll with a DSR Spread governance poll? Options: Yes/No ",

I think we will have to set DSR below 3.5% to get DAI back to $1. Unless we want to kill adoption with very high SF, the SF will also have to go below 3.5%. ",

I wonder what that means. It is same UI MKR holders need to access in order to vote. And win on current value was really tight ~900 MKR that is less than 0,1% of total supply. I think freuency of vote repetition should be derived from that margin. If it is low (as now) it should be repeated oftenly. Once it gets higher it should be repeated with smaller frequency. ",
