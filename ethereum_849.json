We had a hardware partner who specialized in ASICs who was going to work with Least Authority to perform the hardware parts of the audit. They are no longer participating in the audit so we are looking for other auditors for the hardware portion. We have some good candidates, but this effectively delays the start of the audit much more than we anticipated. Because of this I am unsure if the audit will be complete before Istanbul. On top of that I am not sure if  anyone has sorted the funding situation in order to build an open source ProgPoW miner. We have 2 options:  Delay ProgPoW until the hardfork after Istanbul. Have ProgPoW as it\u2019s own hardfork to be implemented once the audit is done.  This is not an ideal situation at all, but despite our best efforts it is what we have before us. This post was also posted in the AllCoreDevs Gitter chat (https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs) for further feedback. ",

I think a lot of people on both sides of this issue have discussed having this proposal implemented in it\u2019s own fork to prevent contention from interfering with the long list of proposals for the Istanbul fork. Obviously that is not ideal, since it involves a lot of coordination outside of a fork window, but I think the next fork is likely to have something related to the Beacon chain finality gadget (unless that is it\u2019s own fork as well). I would prefer having this one proposal be it\u2019s own chain in between scheduled hard forks instead of pushing this to the next one. Maybe it\u2019s time to leverage @shemnon\u2019s hard fork schedule proposal\u2026 ",

The intent of the \u201chardware audit\u201d was more to assess the claims by the creators of the algorithm that ProgPoW makes more complete use of GPU hardware than Ethash does. There are a lot of technical claims made, which sound reasonable, but I think opponents wanted an independent assessment of them. We arguably don\u2019t need to pay auditors to do this, anyone with the requisite experience can do this sort of assessment. The problem is finding someone with the requisite experience. Most people in our community don\u2019t have the deep hardware design experience to do this, so we have to rely on the claims of overall chip usage by the designers.     MadeofTin:  As long as the client implementation is secure won\u2019t the network be secure? Miners are used to making miner software, they will iterate and are also invested in the security of their own software.   Absolutely, from a software perspective this audit will show that the implementation of the algorithm is secure enough for a public deployment. Mining software can be iterated on, and the overall mining software ecosystem will be heterogeneous enough to protect against catastrophic failure. However, assessing the claims made by the algorithm designers I think is more what people wanted to know about, and this audit will only partially provide that without hardware experts. ",

I don\u2019t know how to solve that, other than simply educating others on what it\u2019s all about and keeping things fact-based. In the end though, it\u2019s a social decision, and the only tool we have that we know works for this scenario is hard forking. That\u2019s one of the reasons I believe it should be in a separate fork from Istanbul, to make it very clear accepting the update is approving of it.

We had a hardware partner who specialized in ASICs who was going to work with Least Authority to perform the hardware parts of the audit. They are no longer participating in the audit so we are looking for other auditors for the hardware portion. We have some good candidates, but this effectively delays the start of the audit much more than we anticipated.    @souptacular  and Ethereum core devs , ePIC Blockchain would like to help with the ProgPOW hardware audit. We are former engineers with GPU and mobile SoC semiconductor firms with over 120 years of combined experience designing and manufacturing GPU, mobile SoC and various ASIC\u2019s. Our team consists of key architect and designers who have worked on 8 generations of GPU\u2019s, the shader core for an upcoming game console, as well as, several crypto ASICS. Our supply chain team has put into production 100\u2019s of millions of ASIC\u2019s and GPU\u2019s for ATI/AMD and Qualcomm. Our foundry experience and contacts range across TSMC, GF, Samsung and others through 7nm to 65nm nodes. We would be pleased to work with the Ethereum community in the ProgPOW audit with the neutrality that is needed. Who better to conduct the audit than a team that builds both GPU and ASIC\u2019s and has the full ASIC supply chain and foundry expertise? Be sure to check out our website at www.epicblockchain.io. Also if any of you are in Toronto for the @ScalingETH Dev Workshop next week and want to meet to discuss ASIC\u2019s or what hotspots in Toronto are, drop me a PM. Cheers, Henry PS. I should also point out that ePIC makes ASIC\u2019s and we do not mine. ",

                    "content": "Hi, I\u2019ve engineered both GPU and ASIC miners, and I\u2019ve also operated large-scale CPU and medium-sized GPU farms.  Together with 7400 and Salt, we released an open-source ASIC miner for Cryptonight Classic that was 5x better H/J than Bitmain\u2019s X1, while using only 28nm.  Recently, the Monero PoW team invited me to review RandomX, and I\u2019m also releasing new technical work on Cuckoo Cycle. Our hardware team at altASIC has done an initial review of ProgPoW and posted our comments to their GitHub issue.  We\u2019re unwilling to go on record as to whether ProgPoW will meet its objectives of keeping ASIC\u2019s to within 2x and thereby being considered more ASIC-resistant than Ethash.  Such determination would require more implementation work than we are willing to commit, but we call attention to the published design by Sonia Chen at Linzhi, also referenced in the ProgPoW issue. I\u2019ve cross-posted our comments here from the ProgPoW issue, and hope they\u2019re helpful to the Ethereum community:  Overall, ProgPoW looks to be a genuine, professional attempt by GPU-interested parties.  That is to say, we found no obvious backdoors or any suggestion that ProgPoW is anything but an honest attempt at ASIC resistance. The inner loop does try to cover the shader datapaths pretty well, but obviously GPU\u2019s without a unified texture/L1 architecture will waste some texture area, and all geometry pipelines go unused.  Also, ProgPoW is strictly integer math, while GPU\u2019s predominantly focus on float performance, so that overlap is also less than 100%.  However, we are not GPU insiders and cannot quantify the GPU die area that would go unused in ProgPoW. We do point out that while GPU\u2019s are not especially good at integer multiplication and are outright bad at bit operations, five of eleven random math operations in ProgPoW are bitops and two are multiplies.  For Nvidia, bitops take 2 cycles each, the same as addition, and multiplies are so slow the official docs say only \u201cmultiple cycles.\u201d  In ASIC\u2019s, bit operations especially can run considerably faster. We suspect a VLIW architecture may help exploit this, by combining multiple instructions into a bundle that can be computed in fewer clock cycles than each instruction individually.  If we group the 11 operations into three categories: bitops, adds, and muls (also rot), then our slow-seed compiler can generate instructions like bitop-muladd-bitop that frequently match branches of the abstract syntax tree and run in far less than the 8+ cycles this would take on a GPU.  The timings and dependencies of instructions may be precalculated by the compiler, such that no on-chip sequencing logic is necessary.  Also, the set of VLIW instructions may be generated from the distribution of the program space, and this distribution may also inform the number of compute instances for each instruction.  There would be many bitop-bitop units for example, and fewer bitop-add-mul-add-bitop units, efficiently matching transistor count to the frequency of each op sequence. These gains all together may or may not give a 2x speedup, and we can\u2019t say without deeper analysis. Overall we think ProgPoW is a good try, probably the best anti-ASIC attempt so far.  It is relatively simple and straightforward, and professionally designed and documented, yet we remain uncertain of its chances for keeping the ASIC gap to 2x.  ",

                    "content": "I\u2019m not suggesting that the PoW use floats, and of course I\u2019m well aware of the issues. Actually RandomX does use floats in a CPU-oriented PoW, but they take care to avoid non-normal conditions like underflow and NaN, and they\u2019ve verified implementation consistency with the IEEE standard across Intel, AMD, and ARM, exhaustively validating all possible outputs of their float operators. My point is that GPU\u2019s are primarily designed for floating point performance, not integers or bitops or flow control.  In fact, the only operation that runs in a single cycle on an Nvidia card is a half-precision float muladd.  Full precision float multiplies run in just 2 cycles even though their integer multiply counterpart is much slower.  GPU\u2019s can do this because you just don\u2019t need exact answers in graphics shaders, only something that\u2019s close enough to look good to a human eye.  GPU\u2019s do the best they can in a short time and leave some small errors in the LSB\u2019s of the significand, which is obviously unsuitable for a PoW.  PoW\u2019s require exactness and integer arithmetic, and using GPU\u2019s for PoW is like using a hammer to drive a screw.  The main thing they do well, float muladds, goes unused. That is changing recently with the greater emphasis on GPGPU computing, but the focus is really on scientific compute and deep learning, which are both primarily all float ops.  There is not much incentive outside crypto for GPU manufacturers to improve integer performance. Although I want to maintain a neutral stance on ProgPoW vs Ethash, in general I think ASIC resistance is a fool\u2019s errand, and GPU mining is doomed.  The ProgPoW team did what they could within the constraints provided, but you can\u2019t turn a boat into a car.  Not their fault if it doesn\u2019t work.  GPU\u2019s are just suboptimal for PoW computations. ProgPoW\u2019s hope is that is they do get \u201cclose enough\u201d to ASIC performance that the economics of scale in the GPU industry make smaller ASIC manufacturers unable to compete, but this is an Economy of Scale effect, not a technical difference between ASIC\u2019s and GPU\u2019s.  ASIC\u2019s by their very definition will always be faster than general compute units at the task for which the ASIC was designed.  The question is whether a GPU\u2019s integer performance is good enough relative to ASIC\u2019s to allow the GPU industry\u2019s economy of scale to make up the difference. If GPU integer performance sucks very badly then ProgPoW may be worse than Ethash.  If GPU\u2019s perform pretty well at integers, then ProgPoW may be better.  We\u2019re not willing to speculate without a lot more work. My personal view on PoW is that there is no such thing as ASIC resistance.  Furthermore, GPU\u2019s can jump coins and are easily rented and are therefore less secure than ASIC\u2019s even before you consider hashrates.  A PoW needs to be simple to understand and implement, and it needs to be well reviewed by serious cryptographers.  IMO Ethereum should dump both ProgPoW and Ethash and use Keccak.  But there\u2019s too much GPU-interested politics in Ethereum for that\u2026 ",

The good side is that because GPU miner\u2019s hardware is less specialized (they can always sell the hardware at a loss or mine another coin), they will not dig as deep a position against an existential threat to their operations (for example, the upcoming move to PoS and the mining reward reduction when we employ the finality gadget). If PoW mining were the long-term goal of Ethereum, then it would absolutely make the most sense to adopt an ASIC friendly position, because that type of deep hardware investment aligns these actors long-term with the health and security of the current chain. But we are not trying to do this! As a community we are looking to make a move to a completely different consensus mechanism that eliminates the need for any sort of mining over time. To respond to the specific criticism though, rental attacks hold true for any PoW algorithm, no matter what is considered the most profitable hardware for mining it (CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, etc.). In the general case, if you do not have a supermajority share of the hardware considered to be the most profitable for mining a particular PoW algorithm, you will be at risk to a rental attack. Ethereum currently attracts the largest share of GPUs used for mining. If it were to change it\u2019s algorithm to something that attracts more specialized hardware, that currently mines another coin more profitably, the network would become much more insecure as a result. Therefore changing to another algorithm where the GPU is not the most profitable hardware for mining it would almost certainly lead to a loss of security over what we currently have. It also represents a centralization of power as these manufacturers are much better coordinated and have larger incentives to disrupt any unprofitable changes than to current mining algorithm. It simply should not be done. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controversial to say we should either make a change in an attempt to further ensure ETH is the most valuable coin for GPU miners to mine, or accept that we as a community no longer value ASIC resistance and we prefer to let specialized hardware own our network security from the near future onwards, for better or worse. The later option will happen by default as it does not require any change to the current technical design of Ethereum, but we should recognize it represents a change to the social contract laid out from the beginning in the Whitepaper. However, deciding to go all in on allowing ASICs may see an exodus of GPU miners as they divest themselves from involvement in our community, so we may see short term insecurity as a result. Failure to make an active decision one way or another represents a win for specialized hardware manufacturers, and invites them to make further investment into our ecosystem with the knowledge that they can win against the community on any dispute much easier than if we did make an active decision. Whatever we decide, it should be understood that it may come at the detriment of our future plans for a transition to PoS. ",

I would ask that anyone who is serious about debating ProgPow watch it first. She is Miss If (of If/Def/Else) so her word is gospel when it comes to the authors intent. First, let\u2019s not conflate ASIC-resistance with ASIC-proof.  No algorithm is ASIC-proof.  What ASIC-resistance aims to do is to resist, not prevent.  By making an algorithm that is very well suited to the GPGPUs it makes the economics of producing and maintaining unpalatable, short of a sustained tripling of Eth\u2019s all time high.  Making GPUs the best device on the market to do it and designing the algorithm so that an ASIC would look like a GPU missing some ports an chips is their method.  Miss If admits it is a short term solution and that this resistance has a time limit.  The goal is to make that time limit past the Proof of Stake transition. And that one of the reasons I think ProgPow should be done.  We need to move the cheese before ASICs dominate the mining aspect in the way they have controlled BTC and other cryptocurrencies.  The need for a return on investment is a contradictory alignment of interests.  By moving to a GPU favorable algorithm the miners who do remain will have devices that are still useful when mining on the original Ethereum mainnet becomes moot, because Serenity is fully activated.  If all the miners were on ASICs their incentive would be to sabotage such a transition as their hardware would be useless.  But with a GPGPU there is still utility in AI, other cryptos, or even gasp video games. So there is a community commitment to \u201cmove the cheese\u201d once Proof-of-Stake becomes viable.  If we flinch now updating the Proof-of-Work algorithm because the chosen algorithm isn\u2019t ASIC-proof then there is a reason to doubt if the community will ever be willing to pull the trigger to end the mainnet and let the difficulty bomb fully explode.  Remember, we were supposed to already be on a Proof of Stake network by now, the plan has already changed. ",

I\u2019m not denying there are clever ways to create new ASICs, some we know about and some that will be invented, that is the nature of the beast. VLIW is one of those possible methods. My first goal was to clarify the meaning of ASIC resistance vs ASIC proof, your statement \u201cMy personal view on PoW is that there is no such thing as ASIC resistance\u201d contradicts your new claim that you \u201cunderstand that ASIC resistance is a continuum.\u201d  I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and interpret that when you said \u201cthere is no such thing\u201d what you were arguing was that ASIC resistance is too easily overcome to provide meaningful value.  We both agree there is no such thing as ASIC proof.  The main question are can we delay the entry of ASICs into a ProgPow POW ecosystem, but does the mechanism proposed to delay it in a fashion that makes economic sense.  A two week delay fixed by a change order is a delay, but a pointless one.  Is ProgPow a similarly pointless delay?  That\u2019s the answers I\u2019m looking for from the audit. ",

When I say ASIC resistance is not possible, it is an opinion that \u201ceven economies of scale in GPU\u2019s or CPU\u2019s are not enough to prevent a 2x improvement by ASIC\u2019s in terms of total-cost-per-hash for any given PoW.\u201d  I don\u2019t mean ASIC-proof; even a loose \u201ceconomic resistance\u201d seems too much.  And even if 2x is achieved, I do not think that is enough to save GPU\u2019s.  But these are personal opinions not ProgPoW facts. Maybe ProgPoW proves me wrong.  I\u2019m open to that.  Like I said, I think it\u2019s the best try so far, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s better than Ethash.  It\u2019s a good try for sure. Certainly ProgPoW is much more than an ECO on Ethash.  It\u2019s an all-new chip for sure.  But the spec has been around long enough that you should expect a great deal of ASIC design work to already be completed.  You could see ProgPoW ASIC miners on the network within 4-6 months of a switch to ProgPoW being finalized.  I would expect manufacturers to wait for certainty on ProgPoW before taping out, so it\u2019s actually to your benefit to keep alive the possibility of not switching.  That\u2019s 4 months from decision time, not from launch time\u2026 For a case study in forking to fight ASIC\u2019s, look at Monero.  Their first attempt was useless (quickly ECO\u2019d) but even big changes were overcome by ASIC\u2019s within 6 months or so.  The thing currently keeping ASIC\u2019s at bay in Monero is the threat of further imminent forks, not anything to do with the PoW. ",

Of course the total lifetime cost for a miner is capex + time*opex, so if time is short, capex dominates.  It\u2019s a line with capex at time 0, going up with slope opex. < deleted some wrong speculation about ethash vs progpow in capex vs opex > ProgPoW will have both a bigger capex and opex cost compared to Ethash, so both the offset and slope of the total cost line will go up.  That may seem like ProgPoW is an instant win vs Ethash, but it\u2019s not clear, because maybe ProgPoW ASIC\u2019s improve the slope of the cost line vs GPU\u2019s more than Ethash ASIC\u2019s.  Then things depend on the lifetime you choose for the equipment, and the economic-ASIC-resistance lines of the two PoW\u2019s will cross at some point\u2026 You need to basically make an ASIC in order to know its power and area well enough to compute the cost lines that would inform any economic-ASIC-resistance determination.

Would definitely appreciate if you could make the argument of \u201ccapex vs opex\u201d differences in the algorithms, using some of the features of the algorithms to show why those points are true. At a high level, the opex/capex argument is interesting to me. It would seem to make most sense that ensuring the opex for specialized hardware vs. commodity GPUs is as similar as possible and capex somewhat favors commodity GPUs, with a higher ratio of capex to opex, would ensure that the chosen algorithm has a good chance of resisting specialized hardware production for a reasonable period of time (12-18 months being a target). It would also being interesting to hear your take on what practical ranges of these parameters can be expected and under what time frames they would probably be valid for. ",

Actually it probably adds more to the opex side than the capex side, but I don\u2019t know, so I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.

Definitely makes it really hard to speculate on what is the best decision here. On one hand, making the change has a non-trivial chance of being worse than Ethash in terms of efficiency by specialized mining hardware, although that is hopefully not the case since we have more data now. On the other hand, doing nothing seems to all but invite manufacturers of that hardware to the table, with whatever incentive misalignments they may bring. The best approach, as you said above, is to create the threat of making a change, but we are a large community that requires a lot of transparency to function, so it would seem unlikely we could fake it for very long. In my mind, the best scenario is therefore to build, test, and integrate ProgPoW, and at least have it within a hair\u2019s trigger of going live. At that point, you might as well just try the damn thing so you are not seen as bluffing. The more well-researched and implemented options we have at our disposal for alternative mining algorithms, the less appealing it would be to develop hardware for it.

We are working on an upcoming crypto chip whose first application will be Ethash, as announced at ETC Summit 2018 in Seoul. We are facing some delays, but all is fine. All things worth doing take longer than expected.] In my view, @timolson did the Ethereum community a great - free - service with his series of posts and replies in this thread. Thank you Tim! We at Linzhi are a little more open to speculating about the intentions or business deals that may have led to ProgPoW, which look very different from those behind RandomX. The anonymous nature of Mr. Else and Mr. Def as well as a number of surprisingly uniform accounts and articles/presentations are quite intriguing. We don\u2019t know the deals between Core Scientific (where Kristy-Leigh Minehan the main ProgPoW proponent is CTO) and Nvidia. We believe cost advantage leads to centralization  Medium \u2013 3 Feb 19   ASICs and 51%\u200a\u2014\u200aAchieving Mining Dominance How cost advantage drives... We want to take time to explain why we think a change in PoW is risky for Ethereum at this point. Reading time: 5 min read       ProgPoW risks turning Ethereum into an Nvidia-managed game, with ETH devs becoming unpaid support staff to keep the game going. I\u2019m relaying the following quote from people with more GPU expertise than we have or are willing to acquire (not from Linzhi, take it fwiw): \"On AMD V_MUL_LO_U32 uses 16 cycles, on Nvidia starting from Volta IMAD uses 5 cycles. 32-bit multiplication in ProgPoW was pushed under the pretense of it being inefficient on both manufacturers but that turns out to be a lie as on Nvidia it was only inefficient on Pascal. The algorithm is tuned to still let Pascal utilize full memory bandwidth due to simply sheer compute capacity difference coming partially from higher die size which is why comparing GPUs based on price is being pushed as of late. It\u2019s not a secret that 4xx & 5xx series AMD GPUs are not high-end but because ProgPoW\u2019s compute to memory bandwidth ratio is tuned to match Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs are not utilized to their fullest, most importantly losing the full memory bandwidth utilization which is the very basic foundation of the Ethash algorithm.\" Is this true? If so would it leave much of the \u201chonesty of the attempt\u201d that @timolson sees? Phil Daian wrote a great paper over a year ago https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/ There is another anonymous guy out there writing about ProgPoW, ether4life (no, it\u2019s not us).   ether4life    #ProgPoW Follow-Up: The Cost of ASIC Design I was glad to see that IfDefElse published an interesting article \u201cThe Cost of ASIC Design\u201d as a response to my previous article. However, I think IfDefElse are not very familiar with ASIC design and...      ASICs are designed and manufactured when there are buyers. Currently there is sufficient demand if a machine can offer 150 days ROI (with flat/flat assumption, that is coin price flat, difficulty flat). ETH currently pays out 3.6 mio USD / day or about 100 mio USD / month. Without doing much math, it\u2019s not hard to see how a system that pays out 100 mio USD / month can incentivize the design and development of chips. A lot can be done for a few million USD and it\u2019s only natural that different businesses are competing for that money. @fubuloubu - prepared or irregular PoW changes are a big incentive for secret mining. The alternative would be to pre-announce a PoW change one or two years in advance. Quoting @timolson \u201cIf GPU integer performance sucks very badly then ProgPoW may be worse than Ethash. If GPU\u2019s perform pretty well at integers, then ProgPoW may be better. We\u2019re not willing to speculate without a lot more work.\u201d +1 from Linzhi. Tim made many other good points, I can tell you what I am doing: re-read his points, think. There are always new realizations to be had. What about the VLIW design?  We are happy to have more discussions also in our Telegram group LinzhiCorp. ",

If so would it leave much of the \u201chonesty of the attempt\u201d that @timolson sees?   We did not look at the AMD vs Nvidia issue.  When we say \u201chonest attempt\u201d we mean that ProgPoW doesn\u2019t have some secret way to make ASIC\u2019s easy, or any backdoor, or anything like that.  It is definitely pro-GPU. It may be true\u2014almost inevitable\u2014that one manufacturer or card series outperforms the other.  It may be true that the authors have specifically tuned the PoW to favor Nvidia over AMD. AMD vs. Nvidia may be tuned using ProgPoW\u2019s loop constants for compute and memory, and IMO it\u2019s up to the Ethereum community to test different values on different cards and decide what\u2019s fair.  The structure and design of ProgPoW does not fundamentally favor either vendor in my view, and the tunings my be adjusted and tested by any GPU enthusiast who can change one number and compile code.  If the Eth community doesn\u2019t want to do the simple work of trying different loop constants on different cards, then the hard work of fighting over what values are fair, then they can just accept the authors\u2019 suggested tunings.  But don\u2019t be afraid to adjust the loop constants if you are concerned about GPU vendor bias. ",

                    "content": "Hello @Sonia-Chen I have to comment on your post as the information you present is incomplete and misleading. For the record, I am with ePIC Blockchain, a team of former AMD engineers who have over a century of experience designing GPU, mobile SoC and Blockchain ASIC. ePIC does not have a vested interest in either Ethash or ProgPOW. Our sole interest is to help set the record straight with facts or pose questions that a hardware auditor need to address to conduct a comprehensive audit and reach a valid assessment for the Ethereum community. I will address the key points that you posted above that ProgPOW favors Nvidia and that ProgPOW ASIC\u2019s are easy to design: 1. Misleading claim that ProgPOW favors Nvidia     Sonia-Chen:  ProgPoW risks turning Ethereum into an Nvidia-managed game, with ETH devs becoming unpaid support staff to keep the game going. I\u2019m relaying the following quote from people with more GPU expertise than we have or are willing to acquire (not from Linzhi, take it fwiw): \"On AMD V_MUL_LO_U32 uses 16 cycles, on Nvidia starting from Volta IMAD uses 5 cycles. 32-bit multiplication in ProgPoW was pushed under the pretense of it being inefficient on both manufacturers but that turns out to be a lie as on Nvidia it was only inefficient on Pascal. The algorithm is tuned to still let Pascal utilize full memory bandwidth due to simply sheer compute capacity difference coming partially from higher die size which is why comparing GPUs based on price is being pushed as of late. It\u2019s not a secret that 4xx & 5xx series AMD GPUs are not high-end but because ProgPoW\u2019s compute to memory bandwidth ratio is tuned to match Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs are not utilized to their fullest, most importantly losing the full memory bandwidth utilization which is the very basic foundation of the Ethash algorithm.\"   Measured benchmark results do not support Linzhi\u2019s post that ProgPOW favors Nvidia over AMD. I will point to a Medium post, Comprehensive ProgPoW Benchmark by Theodor Ghannam to support my observations. From the Ethereum Hashrates chart, I extracted the following data comparing ProgPOW to Ethash performance for 6-8GB cards using GDDR5 memory. I excluded GDDR5x and GDDR6 cards, to maintain an apples to apples comparison, as faster memories improve ProgPOW performance  Card\u2026.ProgPOW\u2026Ethash\u2026Relative perf RX470 \u2026\u2026 9.7 \u2026\u2026\u2026 20.6 \u2026\u202647.1% RX480 \u2026\u2026 11.4 \u2026\u2026. 21 \u2026\u2026\u2026 54.3% RX580 \u2026\u2026 12.7 \u2026\u2026. 21 \u2026\u2026\u2026 60% 1060 \u2026\u2026\u2026 10.2 .\u2026\u2026 20.6 \u2026\u2026 49.5% 1060ti \u2026\u2026. 14.8 \u2026\u2026 26 \u2026\u2026\u2026 56.9% 1070 \u2026\u2026\u2026. 13.7 .\u2026. 27.7 \u2026\u2026 49.5% 1070ti .\u2026\u2026 13.9 \u2026\u2026 27.7 .\u2026\u2026 50.2%  Note that these results were measured using factory clocks and therefore slower than what miners are used to seeing. I should point out that comparing BIOS\u2019 tuned for Ethash is not a valid comparison as one typically increases the memory clock while underclocking and undervolting the core clock. In ProgPOW, one needs to overclock the core to get higher compute performance. The results show Nvidia and AMD both drop about 50% in performance on ProgPOW. This is to be expected as memory access are now 32 bytes as opposed to 16 bytes requiring double the memory bandwidth. I will reiterate that Linzhi\u2019s post that ProgPOW favors Nvidia over AMD is wrong. I would also chastise Linzhi to do their homework and check the facts before posting incorrect information. 2. Misleading claim that ProgPOW is easy to implement in an ASIC     Sonia-Chen:  There is another anonymous guy out there writing about ProgPoW, ether4life (no, it\u2019s not us). https://ether4life.tumblr.com/post/184222916104/progpow-cost-of-asic-design   Buried inside the article is Linzhi\u2019s misleading claim that states:  The random instruction of EIP 1057 increases die cost/power by about 1%, and causes a die increase of <1mm\u00b2. The proposed open design is demonstrating a logic-only performance of 1.2 GHash at 30W and could be deployed by Bitmain or Innosilicon, resulting in a machine with about half the hashrate of their predecessors, similar to the best GPUs.  These statements are completely incorrect for the following reasons. While it is true that the ProgPOW logic is small and easy to design, Linzhi completely ignores the fact that the performance limitation of a custom ASIC still remains the required memory bandwidth and the resulting logic required for caching and performance. For ProgPow, sequential accesses to the memory is the performance limiting factor. These operations are driven from a 16 kB cache which would be needed in the math block to ensure the pipeline is full and the performance is optimal. This would add area (depending on node/technology chosen) which is not included in the original design. Taking from this Github cache load example:  Light DAG init done Full DAG init done ProgPoW version 0.9.3 Block 30000 Digest 6018c151b0f9895ebe44a4ca6ce2829e5ba6ae1a68a4ccd05a67ac01219655c1 Result 34d8436444aa5c61761ce0bcce0f11401df2eace77f5c14ba7039b86b5800c08 DAG 64 loads, 16384 bytes Cache 11264 loads, 45056 bytes Merge 33792 total (8192 7168 10240 8192) Math 18432 total (0 2048 0 5120 5120 0 0 0 4096 0 2048)  The cache loads are very significant and play a major role in PPA (performance, power & area). This fact was noted by someone who responded to your Medium post. However, somehow the reply was removed from public viewing. Luckily this was captured on Reddit on this counterpoint refuting Linzhi ProgPOW post..  From Medium: Sarah Osbourne reply to Linzhi The first major thing you omitted in your attack on the insignificant ALU is the size of the register file relative to the ALU. A 12 kiB register file will require almost 400,000 gates just for storing the bits. This completely dwarfs the \u2018large\u2019 multiplier at only 20,000 gates. The most important thing that you have conveniently omitted are the 12 completely random cache operations per loop. Note that there are only 20 math operations per loop, so the cache operations are extremely significant. The cost of integrating a 16 kiB SRAM would be at least 500,000 gates just for storing the bits. You would need a 12-port SRAM just to service these requests for one pipelined processing element (which would destroy your simple register file idea), and that is completely ignoring address conflicts and many more problems. If you want anything even remotely resembling the heavily banked SRAMs in GPUs with all their advanced request conflict resolution and so on, then it\u2019s going to take a lot of engineering effort. You might as well become a GPU manufacturer at this point.  Posting such misleading claims do not help Linzhi\u2019s credibility in the Ethereum community. Some people would view this action as a deliberate attempt to sabotage ProgPOW in order to protect your Linzhi Ethash miner which would be bricked by a change to ProgPOW. Let the hardware auditors and the experts in the community present their findings based on facts and then we can discuss why we agree or disagree. Why can\u2019t we all be friends and have FUN like SpongeBOB instead of spreading FUD like Plankton? ",

Est. reading time: 3 minutes       https://coingeek.com/kristy-leigh-minehan-bitcoin-should-work-but-not-be-seen-video/ DYOR The best crypto ASIC related work lately in my opinion is happening in Monero, look for tevador, hyc, solardiz, Tim Olson and others. They have secured funding and tasked 4 auditors with a review within days: Kudelski, QuarksLab, X41, TrailOfBits   reddit    r/Monero - RandomX Auditor Selection 85 votes and 47 comments so far on Reddit      One thought that is still rarely brought up is that \u201cASIC friendliness\u201d just means repeating the \u201cASIC Resistance\u201d pseudo-science one more time (third level maybe ASIC Assistance?  ). The cost of making a Bitcoin miner is far higher than people think. Maybe we find time for a substantial article on this subject one day. We drove sha-256 from 8000 W/T to 100 W/T, we learned a lot. @shemnon  The main question are can we delay the entry of ASICs into a ProgPow POW ecosystem, but does the mechanism proposed to delay it in a fashion that makes economic sense. A two week delay fixed by a change order is a delay, but a pointless one. Is ProgPow a similarly pointless delay?  It\u2019s impossible to find a satisfactory answer. ETH mining is a multi-billion USD industry. At a high-level, if we assume a network capacity of 800 MW and 4 cents/kWh, that\u2019s ca 23 mio USD monthly electricity cost. ETH payouts right now are 103 mio USD / month. That means 80 mio USD/month gross margin. The small guys may be hurting and fighting, but the big guys are making good money. Remember I said a machine sells (there is a buyer) when it\u2019s priced at 150 days ROI flat/flat? That answers the capex question that was brought up earlier. We are happy to answer questions about ASICs and costs and mining economics, all publicly. Hardware manufacturers optimize along 5 dimensions that are often mutually exclusive: cost, performance, efficiency, time to market, reliability. They shouldn\u2019t forget about complexity either, something we are learning right now  Cheers. ",

Stay tuned for more massive announcements. This isn\u2019t the only one.\u201d (in Telegram, just believe me, or believe Nasdaq/Bloomberg). Should we ask the EIP 1057 author whether some of those future announcements relate to Ethereum? What are the deals between Core Scientific and Nvidia? Core Scientific and Squire/Calvin Ayre/nChain? The auditor better look into that (areas of concern 11 and 13), if you don\u2019t want to be surprised by news from Bloomberg one day. We think the current ETH mining is quite stable and decentralized, with at least 4 vendors having competitive chips (AMD, NV, BM, Inno), and at least 5 others working on chips. That\u2019s exactly why some parties who don\u2019t like fair and decentralized mining are working towards centralization. ProgPoW is their tool. It\u2019s an interesting process to see this battle between centralization and decentralization unfold. ",

Kristy/Core/Nvidia/nchain/epic is chastising for homework! chastise = \u201crebuke or reprimand severely\u201d, \u201cinfliction of corporal punishment\u201d. There is indeed punishment for people not doing their homework. If \u201cepic blockchain\u201d is even remotely involved in the audit, we already know the result.   Good morning @Sonia-Chen, Please do not put me in the same camp as Nvidia and Kristy-Leigh. (Core and nChain are not relevant to this discussion). For the record, ePIC has not done the analysis on ProgPOW to determine whether it is a positive or negative change for the Ethereum community. All I did was present to Linzhi some facts and empirical proof that Linzhi\u2019s assertions are incorrect. I clearly showed you in this link ProgPoW Audit Delay Issue that both Nvidia and AMD GPU\u2019s perform virtually the same with 256-bit wide GDDR5 memory i.e. both take a 50% hit in hash rate. And also why Linzhi\u2019s Open ASIC design is inaccurate. Yet you respond back with FUD. If you have alternative information about GPU performance, please present this in your post. Likewise if Linzhi doesn\u2019t agree with ePIC\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s comments about the need for complex memory cache, please show us how your design changes with the addition of a cache.     Sonia-Chen:  We think the current ETH mining is quite stable and decentralized, with at least 4 vendors having competitive chips (AMD, NV, BM, Inno), and at least 5 others working on chips. That\u2019s exactly why some parties who don\u2019t like fair and decentralized mining are working towards centralization. ProgPoW is their tool. It\u2019s an interesting process to see this battle between centralization and decentralization unfold.   Please check your facts. Alex Ao (Innosilicon\u2019s VP marketing) admitted on Grin forum that Innosilicon did not ship their A10 Ethminer. Check out this post. Innosilicon would be stupid to ship a revised A10 miner when they are 1/3 of Linzhi\u2019s claimed hash rate.    Grin \u2013 3 Apr 19    Grin Improvement Proposal 1: put later phase outs on hold and rephrase... No we never shipped any Ethereum miner. The first chip came back functional but there is some performance/stability issue that required a fix to address. We now have the fixed chip back and it is looking promising.   What complicates the situation is...       And as the Ethereum community knows, Bitmain E3 is lame duck. It basically cost the same, performs the same as 6 RX570 GPU and uses the same power. No one would buy an E3 over a GPU rig because there is no advantage and no resale value. Who are the 5 other vendors working on Ethash miners? Show us the proof so we know it\u2019s not Sonia Chen FUD. If it is true, you are signing Linzhi\u2019s death warrant. The community will fork later this year to brick those 5 new rigs and your Lavasnow miner will be killed in the process. I don\u2019t think your CEO Chen Min will be happy that your FUD will cost Linzhi a lot of money by causing a fork and resulting in Linzhi having to scrap any Ethhash inventory. ",

                    "content": "@sonia-chen, in response to your post, I provide 1 knock, 1 question and 2 compliments.     Sonia-Chen:  Linzhi\u2019s four core principles are: truth, learn from customer, innovation, customer trust.   1. Linzhi Core principles at conflict Sonia, from what I can see truth doesn\u2019t seem to be one of Linzhi\u2019s core values. You berate \u201cSarah\u201d on her post but claiming FUD and then you remove both Sarah comment and your reply from public view. I have included your reply on Medium below. Hidden Linzhi reply to Osbourne\u2019s critique of Linzhi\u2019s Open Chip Design https://medium.com/@Linzhi/thank-you-sarah-osbourne-16412add9a67]  Linzhi ASICs Mar 30 Thank you \u201cSarah Osbourne\u201d. We received a lot of very good constructive feedback, for now I include yours in the list. Other great responses came in over github from tevador, solardiz and Peter Salanki. We are collecting all responses and will then think about how we go to the next level. Maybe we will take this design to github and continue a revision/issue process there, so it\u2019s more organized. Is your feedback given in good or bad faith? What is your interest? Who is your employer? We are seeing amazing things around ProgPoW everywhere. We know that we don\u2019t FUD (but we make mistakes). Do you FUD? Your account seems to have been created only for this one reply, which immediately goes into great details of a chip design. Weird, yes? We give you the benefit of the doubt. We assume you are sharing knowledge for truth finding, and you are trying to help us fix mistakes in the design. Thank you!  If Linzhi were interested in the truth, why don\u2019t you do the work to model the 16kB cache and update your Open Chip Design with the complete ProgPOW design? You will find that your claim of 1.2GHash per chip will require exponentially more bandwidth and logic that than you think. This Rocket science to most but innate knowhow that we GPU designers know how to solve after decades of experience designing complex caches e.g. that service 4,000 cores (threads) operating at >2Ghz, all needing simultaneous memory access and needing to deal with memory contention. 2. Does Linzhi\u2019s Bitcoin expertise apply to Ethash and ProgPOW? You claim that your CEO Chen Min\u2019s, Bitcoin design background makes Linzhi an ASIC design expert. I would argue that the design principles for a Bitcoin chip are very different those used for an Ethash or ProgPOW ASIC. That said, we know that Chen Min during her tenure at Canaan used a VCA (Value Chain Aggregrator) to design at least 2 of their chips. Bitcoin/SHA256 ASIC\u2019s are simple designs with each core taking less than 100 lines of code; you take 1 core and replicate it over and over again in an ASIC core. The difficult part is that custom design process which takes time and a lot of hand crafting. Full-custom layout that requires greater attention to area and performance than the full digital (ASIC) flow, but has less stringent requirements for speed and less need for control over device-level layout than datapath or analog layout: We call this type of layout \"custom digital layout.\u201d More details about custom design methodology in this EEtimes article. https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1277368# By contrast, you would use a digital design methodology for more complex ASIC\u2019s like those for Ethash and ProgPOW (although Ethash and the FMV block are relatively easy to design). As an example, custom Bitcoin ASIC\u2019s are 16-20mm2 in size and digital design GPU\u2019s are typically 200-600mm2 in size, which are an order of magnitude larger than BTC ASIC\u2019s. The skill set needed for digital design is different than those needed for custom designs.     Sonia-Chen:  One thought that is still rarely brought up is that \u201cASIC friendliness\u201d just means repeating the \u201cASIC Resistance\u201d pseudo-science one more time (third level maybe ASIC Assistance?  ). The cost of making a Bitcoin miner is far higher than people think. Maybe we find time for a substantial article on this subject one day. We drove sha-256 from 8000 W/T to 100 W/T, we learned a lot.   3. Open and transparent audits     Sonia-Chen:  The best crypto ASIC related work lately in my opinion is happening in Monero, look for tevador, hyc, solardiz, Tim Olson and others. They have secured funding and tasked 4 auditors with a review within days: Kudelski, QuarksLab, X41, TrailOfBits https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/bozr0z/randomx_auditor_selection/   I totally agree with you on the need for transparent audits and the Monero model is a great one to mimic. It\u2019s pretty clear to expert ASIC designers like ourselves and to Linzhi that any audit will be ineffective if the audit firm doesn\u2019t have the latest design tools, in depth GPU design experience, in-depth development experience with crypto algorithms and memory controllers. It seems many Core Devs like @Anlan  and @fubuloubu  share the same concerns about the lack of transparency wrt auditor selection as shown below.     Anlan:  So why simply not disclose ? Any reason like :   They don\u2019t have time   They don\u2019t understand what to do   They consider themselves not competent   They asked for more money   Whatever \u2026   I\u2019m not speculating but I\u2019m fed up with governance\u2019s lack of clarity   4. Why can\u2019t we be friends?     Sonia-Chen:  @epic.henry  Why can\u2019t we all be friends and have FUN 1 like SpongeBOB instead of spreading FUD like Plankton?  No. Don\u2019t try that. Don\u2019t like you.   Irrespective of what you think, we have a lot of respect for your CEO, Chen Min. Maybe we can be friends and ePIC can help Linzhi design that complex memory controller you need for ProgPOW. Any mistake in your design wrong will cost Linzhi several million dollars for masks and wafers as well as a 3 month schedule hit for chip spins and fab cycle time. I\u2019ll close this long post with a song by War, Why can\u2019t we be friends?  ",

I can\u2019t emphasize this enough.  There could be a straightforward community effort to collect the best ProgPoW tunings for a variety of popular GPUs, then decide on something that\u2019s \u201cmarket fair.\u201d I\u2019ve seen charts that quantify the power-per-hash using the current constants, but that metric doesn\u2019t consider % of resource usage for each card.  Yes H/W might be the same across cards, but the overall hashrate on some cards will be artificially low (and still proportional by power). If such information is not already available, we need a chart of the optimal values for PROGPOW_CNT_CACHE and PROGPOW_CNT_MATH for a variety of popular GPU\u2019s.  The optimal loop constant values are the smallest numbers which give a \u201csaturated\u201d maximum hashrate on the card.  This requires use of the vendor\u2019s devkit telemetry tools, but a simple recipe and test harness could be made to allow home GPU enthusiasts to try all combinations.  With a spreadsheet of GPU cost, power, hashrate, and optimal loop constants, the community can make an informed, transparent decision on the values for the two loop constants, and thereby openly divide the market based on different GPU vendors\u2019 capabilities.

                    "content": "@fubuloubu Thanks for asking. I work for a small self-funded chip startup, we are a bunch of folks in a small office in Shenzhen basically. My answers to your questions are \u201cmarket chat\u201d, things we hear, think, guess, calculate.  Are AMD and Nvidia working on future mining-only chip designs?  I doubt it. Agree with @timolson \u201cusing GPU\u2019s for PoW is like using a hammer to drive a screw\u201d. GPUs are good to secure small networks or new coins, and for development. For now PoW chips are fixed-function, they tend to have much lower margins (utility chips) and are thus not interesting for Nvidia. Therefore, Nvidia will focus efforts on marketing to create enough instability to deter ASICs and to keep the mining revenues on GPUs through forks (btw, in our view the competition between Nvidia and AMD is largely for show, to keep antitrust regulators happy, but that gets us into politics and totally away from technology).  If so, do you have link to public release documents.  No.  Are these the latest BM 1/Inno 1 miners? Are there more available privately?  I\u2019m combining these two questions. Let\u2019s assume a vendor will always try to sell their most advanced product. I think neither Bitmain nor Innosilicon are currently offering Ethash machines. I contacted them through a friend this morning, just asking for a quote - anyone can do this. We do know both Bitmain and Innosilicon are \u201cclose\u201d to a competitive offering, technically. Bitmain has sold 20k E3 (our latest estimate), Innosilicon decided not to sell/offer for sale. I want to take the time to walk through the economics, using Bitmain E3 as an example: Why is the E3 not being offered anymore? When will it be offered again? At which pricepoint? Those questions can be answered rationally, excluding a few exceptional things like insolvency, unsold inventory blocking the market, willingness to loose a lot of money to bankrupt a competitor, trade wars, politics, etc. We need to know three things: cost, margin, ROI.   Cost Since the E3 is a close competitor to us, we spend some time to analyze its cost. We get a machine, take it apart, think about it, and put some numbers into a simple spreadsheet. The key cost component of an E3 are the 576 memory dies. At the very lowest, we can imagine cost of 40 US cents / memory die (most likely it\u2019s higher). We calculate a lowest-possible E3 machine cost of 840 USD.   Margin Nvidia needs a gross margin of 60% to be happy (you can take this number from published financial reports). Any new business (sales) with a lower margin is bad for Nvidia, any new business with a higher margin is good for Nvidia. We don\u2019t know the margin Bitmain is targeting, but let\u2019s just put it at 30% for now.   ROI The current ETH networks pays 2.15 cents/MH/day (bitinfocharts.com) We assume an all-in power price of 4 US cents (that\u2019s a realistic number for the purpose of this calculation, just believe me) An E3 that hashes 190MH at 800W thus generates 2.15 * 190=4.08 USD at a cost of 24 * 0.8 * 0.04=0.77 USD for gross revenue of 3.31 USD / day The machine sells, in the current market, at 150 days ROI flat/flat (again just believe me), that means 150 * 3.31 = 496.5 USD   Now we can put it all together: At the current Ethash profitability, Bitmain would need to offer the E3 at 500 USD to find a buyer, but it wants 840 * 1.3=1,100 USD. Noone will order, Bitmain won\u2019t even offer, nothing happens. How high does the Ethash profitability have to go for E3 sales to restart: 1100/150=7.33 USD/day + power .77=8.1 USD/190=0.0426 cents/MH/day. At the current difficulty, that would mean an ETH coin price of 246*(0.0426/0.0215) = 488 USD. We got it! E3 sales will restart if ETH goes back to 488 USD  This may be impacted by irrational assumptions aka \u201crisk taking\u201d by certain market participants, but by and large this gives you a good mental model to relax and watch what\u2019s happening.  Are they doing any private mining with more efficient hardware that is to be released?  Who can rule this out after all that happened in recent years. Who is to say that \u201cthey\u201d must be the ASIC designers or manufacturers. It could also be the ASIC (or GPU) buyers that want to do private mining with more efficient hardware that they have secretly acquired. You may remember tweets of the EIP 1057 author directed at you (since deleted)  \u201cGenesis Mining and others also benefitted heavily from private optimisations for 2+ years\u201d \u201cI even traded VBIOS\u2019 for hardware discounts\u201d  Yes this is mudslinging, but since an unfair story is repeated forever (\u201cgreedy chinese asics\u201d), you might as well hear the other side once in a while. We know who comes to us and tries to meet and tries to buy, and what they want. Some ETH community members should be flies on the wall, that\u2019d be fun\u2026 I know this is annoying, but it\u2019s a fact that the EIP 1057 author is doing big business deals with Calvin Ayre\u2019s and Craig Wright\u2019s companies (just read the news, linked in the last post). Whether mining becomes more transparent or more private is a consequence of the aggregate decisions of the community. In a community that prefers theories over business scrutiny, business people will continue without oversight.  If there are 5 others working on chips (I assume you are one of them), how close are they to be production?  We are transparent, we are trying this. We are very far from production  I want to reiterate a general invitation to our office and factory in Shenzhen. ASICs are fun, a lot to learn. Let\u2019s go through the others - market chat\u2026  vidtoo in Hangzhou: even further from production than us Ingenic in Beijing: just starting with crypto, confused about Ethash vs ProgPoW, even further from production than us, but don\u2019t want to underestimate them Samsung: May be the real reason of Nvidia\u2019s ProgPoW effort (in addition to excluding Bitmain). Instability will keep them away. unknown (to us) team working with Xilinx ZU6EG/9EG: Since ProgPoW has a lot more logic than Ethash, it has brought some FPGAs back in play. We don\u2019t know many details about this effort or how it would work for Ethash, but the team is real afaik. If ProgPoW progresses, I would love to hear from people who take a serious look at the ZU6EG/9EG and are willing to share their findings openly.  I admit that I don\u2019t have a specific fifth one for you. The entire sentence reads \u201cWe think the current ETH mining is quite stable and decentralized, \u2026 with at least 5 others working on chips.\u201d You bet there are at least 10, 20 or more \u201cothers\u201d. In Shenzhen alone we have about 1000 semiconductor startups. Maybe people forgot the garages. The beauty of PoW chips is that you immediately have great constraints to focus your design skills on. Professors all over semiconductor classes are saying \u201cThis semester we are going to design an Ethash ASIC\u201d, and the students say \u201cyeahh\u2026 coool\u2026\u201d  Then you have existing chip businesses with under-utilized design teams who need to be kept busy, so why not try a PoW asic? Bottom line: Noone is close to production.  How much more efficient will they be?  OK the crazy fun answer first: ETH DAG size increases linear, but semiconductor density increases more than linear. How about a single-die 5nm chip generating 20 GH hashrate? How about 3D chips, high-density wiring between dies, silicon photonics? More seriously, your question asks for an economic answer: As much as the monthly payouts for Ethash (or ProgPoW) increase, efficiency gains will be made. However GPUs are holding up well against E3 and A10. How easy or hard is it for higher-efficiency machines to push out lower-efficiency machines? Before we calculated that E3 sales could restart if ETH coin price reaches 488 USD. Let\u2019s calculate how low coin price can go before the big GPU operators would be pushed out: Let\u2019s take a GPU average of 30 MH at 150 W (there is quite some variance in this). Daily power cost: 0.15 * 24 * 0.04=14.4 cents Daily revenues: 30 * 0.0215=64.5 cents 246/(64.5/14.4)=54.92 USD So in this way of calculating, ETH price could go as low as 55 USD! That shows how strong the position of existing machines is, once they are paid for and installed. Let\u2019s try another way of calculating recycling resistance, from SHA-256 machines: We know the Avalon machines best because we designed and manufactured them. Here in Shenzhen nothing gets wasted, we see the parts of our old machines in the parts market, then we know the recycling situation. We are certain that all A6 have been recycled, we are guessing about 50% of A7 have been recycled, and we think no A8 has been recycled yet (we haven\u2019t seen A8 parts in the used parts market). I\u2019m using averages: A6 = 3.5T@1100W. A7 = 6.5T@1000W, A8 = 11T@1200W. At power cost of 0.04 cents/kWh, and current SHA-256 rewards of 27 cents/TH/day, it looks like this: A6 (100% recycled): 3.5 * 27=94.5 cents revenues, 24 * 1.1 * 0.04=1.06 USD cost. 94.5 < 106 : 100% recycled A7 (50% recycled): 6.5 * 27=175 cents revenues, 24 * 1 * 0.04=0.96 cents cost. 175 > 96: 50% recycled A8 (0% recycled): 11 * 27=297 cents revenues, 24 * 1.2 * 0.04=1.15 USD cost. 297 > 115: 0% recycled This gives us a lot of confidence, it looks right! Some people have higher power costs, lower power costs. Higher or lower labor or capital costs. But in the end it all has to come down back to earth. For ETH, there is a lot of variance in GPU performance, and GPUs will continue to improve. If an E3 needs 488 USD/ETH to sell, but (some) GPUs by (some) operators can still be profitably run at 80 USD/ETH, that means the E3 will not push out GPUs anytime soon. The pain you are hearing from GPU operators at 150 USD/ETH, 120 USD/ETH, 100 USD/ETH and lower is the small GPU guys hurting from competition with the large GPU guys. It has nothing to do with ASICs. Bottom line: expect incremental efficiency gains, because theoretical efficiency gains are held back economically. Thinking about these numbers may be a bit depressing. The ETH community shuffles hundreds of millions of USD to some very weird business people and megafarms. If the community cannot or doesn\u2019t want to stay in control of this, or thinks it can do better with less waste, then switch to PoS faster.  Will they self-mine before release for \u201cquality assurance purposes\u201d?  Depends on what the community or the customer of the manufacturer wants. We are open to community oversight, just board a plane to Shenzhen. Why do we try an open process? Because we don\u2019t believe in fixed-function chips and are targeting programmable chips for which we need to cowork with developers. Hope this makes sense, thanks again for asking.  Final Thoughts: I\u2019m sure I made mistakes in this post, some numbers wrong, some thought paths wrong. So what, we are learning. At least I\u2019m sharing something. Maybe it\u2019s helpful to an auditor. The ProgPoW team is also fun, once you can decode their language. Kristy, Henry, Jon Stevens, Jean Cyr, Teddy, Amel, Sarah, Heisenbug, Greerso, etc. - ha ha. The details of their corporate scheming don\u2019t matter because we will most likely never see leaked contracts anyway. What\u2019s happening is obvious though, just do research, read news, connect the dots. Yes the community should turn those knobs and make sure mining is fair, but it won\u2019t be enough to address the deeper problems of GPU mining in that large companies such as the one where the EIP 1057 author is CTO can gain an unfair advantage because they have co-opted the community to monopolize the supply chain for them down to the one chip vendor they have hooked up with. The solution to that is to bring Samsung, Bitmain, Inno and small guys like Linzhi in to decentralize. A self-serving argument  For reference here is a collection of writings of team ProgPoW, maybe someone can run some stylometry over this. Dust off your bitcointalk password, login and check out the trust page of the EIP 1057 author. Follow other links.

                    "content": "Happy weekend @Sonia-Chen, I am responding to several of your comments including:    potential ASICs for Ethereum;     Why Ethereum doesn\u2019t scale with process nodes;     Other information/FUD    1. Follow the Money \u2013 why small companies are eyeing Ethereum?     Sonia-Chen:  I admit that I don\u2019t have a specific fifth one for you. The entire sentence reads \u201cWe think the current ETH mining is quite stable and decentralized, \u2026 with at least 5 others working on chips.\u201d You bet there are at least 10, 20 or more \u201cothers\u201d.   There\u2019s saying in North America that encapsulates what you are pointing out here about multiple companies eyeing Ethereum ASIC\u2019s \u2026 \u201cFollow the money!\u201d To elaborate, Ethereum is the 2nd largest coin and represents over $700M USD in mining rewards. Currently there are only 2 serious contenders, AMD and Nvidia (and counting the weak E3 effort from Bitmain) and in theory, ASIC\u2019s should have an overwhelming advantage over GPU\u2019s. So multiple companies are relishing the opportunity to make bijillions of dollars by building Ethereum ASIC\u2019s. This is no different than how the market evolved with Bitcoin ASIC development. The path to Bitcoin success is littered with defunct companies, failed efforts and $100\u2019s of millions of dollars of lost investments. I point you to this Bitcoin Wiki which shows:  28 ASIC\u2019s going to market 10 ASIC\u2019s being canceled About 50 ASIC\u2019s announced but status is unknown  Ultimately only Bitmain, Canaan, Innosilicon/Holong and Whatsminer/Bitwei were successful. Even a giant with deep pockets and early access to 7nm nodes like GMO failed and withdrew from the market. Ethereum is a much more complicated design and has the added cost burden of memory dependency (that I will post on a different thread one day). As you well know, Ethereum ASIC\u2019s are not easy to build. Even with a superstar designer like your CEO, Chen Min, Linzhi is at least 11 months (Aug 2018 to June 2019) into development with no tape-out date in sight. Assuming you are taping out at the end of July and the earliest you will see \u201csuper hot lot\u201d samples is Nov. 7. Assuming another 2 weeks testing and qualification, you are another 80 days from production depending on fab availability. Oh and add another 2 weeks for OSAT (Outsourced Assembly & Test) which takes a little longer due to your use of an interposer and HBM stacked die. Linzhi\u2019s total project time is \u201cguestimated\u201d to be 19 months (i.e. August 2018 to Feburary 2020). That\u2019s a far cry from your original presentation in September that was projecting April 2019 projection or 9 months (August 2018 to April 2019) 2. Semiconductor densities translate to non-linear improvements     Sonia-Chen:  ETH DAG size increases linear, but semiconductor density increases more than linear. How about a single-die 5nm chip generating 20 GH hashrate? How about 3D chips, high-density wiring between dies, silicon photonics?   Sonia, my friend, let\u2019s debate using facts and empirical proof. Your comment makes no sense as Ethereum is bottlenecked by memory bandwidth and not semiconductor logic; therefore, Ethereum hashrate will improve but only to the extent of available memory bandwidth (in other words, zero improvement, unless memory subsystem changes). Case in point is the 7nm Radeon VII at 90MHs (1400c/1000m) compared to the 14nm Vega56 at 38MHs (1138c/800m). Performance increases by 2.4x which is the increase in memory bandwidth by 2x bus width (ie. 4096-bit vs 2048-bit) multiplied by 1.25 or 1000MHz/800MHz (increase in memory clock). 38 MHs x 4096/2048 x 1000/800 = 95MHs (close to the measured 90MHs) To reiterate, moving from 14nm to 7nm and increasing the core clock by 23% (ie 1400MHz/1138MHz) DID NOT improve hashing performance beyond the increase in memory bandwidth. 3. ProgPOW and BSV conspiracy     Sonia-Chen:  I know this is annoying, but it\u2019s a fact that the EIP 1057 author is doing big business deals with Calvin Ayre\u2019s and Craig Wright\u2019s companies (just read the news, linked in the last post).   What point are you trying to make about Kristy, Calvin and Craig? Are you suggesting that Bitcoin SV is going to adopt ProgPOW as their POW instead of SHA256 and nChain?  ROFLMFAO 4. Help from friends     Sonia-Chen:  We are transparent, we are trying this. We are very far from production   Send me a PM. We can help you with design of your ASIC and procurement of HBM memories. My team is from AMD and has extensive experience with HBM through 2 generations of Vega design and 8 generations of GPU design. Even the Beatles know that they need to get by \u201cWith a little help from my friends.\u201d ",

I thought your article would have put an end to the AMD vs Nvidia argument but the FUD and mudslinging continues. (Btw, are you going to update the data for DDR6 and Navi? I have some boards on order so I can send you test data when I get the cards. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be an apples to apples comparison as Nvidia uses 384-bit wide memory as opposed to AMD\u2019s 256-bit wide bus)     xazax310:  I haven\u2019t been active because this whole damn progpow discussion continues to go around in circles, I\u2019m sick of it all.   I too am sick of the controversy around ProgPOW. Ultimately my company, ePIC Blockchain decided to step in and contribute our expertise, which consist of both GPU and ASIC design, to help with the ProgPOW audit. See this post to Hudson Jameson after all requests to emails, PM\u2019s, to ECH (Ethereum Cat Herders) and Least Authority were ignored for a week prior to my post.     xazax310:  I want to know a straight answer from the Devs working on ProgPoW Audit A) Is it 100% agreed that \u201cAudit must be complete for ProgPoW to be implemented?\u201d I\u2019ve heard this thrown around but I\u2019ve haven\u2019t heard it as the official statement for inclusion. B) Do we have ANY time-frame now because of this company that dropped out to do the ASIC tests?   You ask good questions since the whole audit selection process has not been transparent as Anlan and other pointed out in this post. I have little faith in the audit as the goals and methodology has not been made clear. For a more robust audit, the methodology also needs scrutiny and input. ECH and the core devs are not ASIC and GPU experts and, therefore, are not the best people qualified to assess whether the methodology is valid and complete. ePIC offered to provide input and help with the audit, even as a contributor, to fill in the gaps but that offer was also met with silence. There are a lot of open questions to address in the audit and expertise needed which is not generally available, including ASIC development tools and GPU architecture and driver knowledge including the ability to code to the metal. @timolson noted in this post that the audit is a thankless job, that loses money and needs tools that many firms don\u2019t have. I would also add that the Linzhi Open Chip Design needs to be synthesized to show if their claims are true and not.     xazax310:  B) Do we have ANY time-frame now because of this company that dropped out to do the ASIC tests?   I finally received an email 9 days ago that ECH had selected a hardware auditor but that has not been announced yet. Minutes from the core dev meeting #62 stated that ProgPOW is likely to miss Istanbul due to the hardware audit slipping.     xazax310:  C) By April 2020 The next \u201cIce-age\u201d will start effectively putting ProgPoW and the Iceage together for miners meaning it\u2019s damn near disaster. What is the point of the ice-age until PoS is few months out(which it isnt)?   Based on current pace of ETH 2.0 development, it is almost impossible for PoS to go mainnet in 2020. The pace of research is slow; there is a lot to be done to ensure security of the network and to prevent a hardware arms race. EDITS - to fix links and typos ",

I thought your article would have put an end to the AMD vs Nvidia argument but the FUD and mudslinging continues.   Sorry, but unfortunately I think @xazax310\u2019s benchmark is not what is needed, and it\u2019s probably misleading. First off, it looks like he only tested one program (a single block height.)  Any single program may have a non-representative distribution of math operations, so many possible block heights / programs must be tested and an average taken. Secondly, as I mentioned above, merely optimizing the hashrate & power per card does nothing to show whether the card is near 100% utilization on all resources.  The ProgPoW authors could have tuned the loop constants for Nvidia cards, and xazax310\u2019s benchmark would not show the bias. This is not FUD.  I have zero interest in Ethereum politics.  I own zero ETH and do not mine it.  If you want to claim that the ProgPoW authors have no Nvidia bias, follow the proposal I wrote above, which requires modifying the loop constants and testing GPU resource utilization NOT total hashrate or hash-per-watt.  Do the ProgPoW authors\u2019 proposed constants cause higher utilization on Nvidia cards vs AMD\u2019s?  xazax\u2019s benchmark does not answer this question. ",

ProgPow proposes to more efficiently convert energy into network security neutralizing the threat of not fixed function ASIC\u2019s but also proprietary GPU and FPGA hardware and software innovations that are cheating the current PoW algorithm.  A ProgPow fixed function ASIC should be welcomed as it would only further decentralize the hashing power because it would be no more efficient than 1.2x like cost hardware. Ethereum has hard forks on the roadmap already.  In the unlikely event that, like cost, fixed function hardware successfully hashes greater than 1.2x, Ethash-ProgPow has tunable knobs.  Ehash-DaggerHashimoto has successfully kept fixed function hardware at bay this long, only now are weaknesses in the algorithm starting to be exploited, ProgPoW removes these known weaknesses. The audit should be confirming that ProgPoW does not break anything/create security issue and no more.  Trying to prove that something that does not exist could not do a thing does not sound sensible.  Ethash-ProgPow is different to Ethash-DaggerHashimoto and is tuneable, that is already an improvement over status quo. Core devs have already stated that for good reason this hard fork should be separate to any planned fork, discussion around Istanbul is irrelevant.  There is no doubt the community want it, all is left is to make sure that it is bug free and secure then implement. ",

Earlier in the audit process there was talk of including an analysis of whether the goals of ProgPow were worth pursuing / possibly counterproductive to Ethereum\u2019s security.

What is the best evidence that \u201cthere is no doubt that the community want it\u201d? I am concerned that because most of the objectors don\u2019t have a personal stake in the outcome, most of them (including myself) stopped participating in the discussions due to fatigue long ago. Yet ProgPow advocates are continuing to push for this. This might give the impression that sentiment is becoming more favorable to ProgPow when it isn\u2019t. The data I\u2019ve seen seems consistent with ProgPow being favored by a highly vocal minority, rather than the community in general. If sentiment has shifted in favor of ProgPow, there should be people we can point to who used to oppose it who now favor it. Who are those people? Btw, I will be in Berlin during the Magicians Council and am interested in discussing ProgPow as it relates to how decisions are made for Ethereum. ",

The few very big mouths against aren\u2019t even against ProgPoW for technological reasons but more out of a want for an immediate switch to PoS and ignorance about the serious threat of centralization to the current PoW. The developers decided 9/2018 then later, after the fore-mentioned vocal minority spoke up, asked Cat Herders to get community feedback.  The signals that mattered were: Hash voting 100% in favor (voter turnout 77.1%) CarbonVote 93.6786% in favor (29,37,726.9575 to 198237.5702 ether) Verifiable at https://etherscan.io/address/0x90a3aa83b0da90abe2c33fadbe829cf74dfa59d9 and https://etherscan.io/address/0x975f4ac23fcc9c39228cc20a2d4897c7b9bb39cc Tennagraph, 73% in favor coin voting, 87% in favor gas voting All this heavy favor despite many lies, false sponsored attacks, and blatant attempt to manipulate vote outcome by gpushack by adding a false statement and a link to vote to ethos distro\u2019s dashboard (@5chdn deleted the screenshot but I\u2019m sure I can find it if somebody wants to see). Your previous posts link to outdated information about the benefits of fixed function hardware on a network, since those studies we have seen and had opportunity to reconsider and the discussion has never been about whether the Ethereum network has had a change of heart on its statements made in both white and yellow papers.

Here\u2019s why:     greerso:  Hash voting 100% in favor (voter turnout 77.1%)   There are 18 entities that voted, all of them are existing miners who we should expect to be part of the vocal minority who wants to preserve GPU mining.     greerso:  CarbonVote 93.6786% in favor (29,37,726.9575 to 198237.5702 ether)   About 3% of total ETH was represented in this vote \u2013 an extremely small percentage. Likely people who really care a lot about this issue are over-represented in the sample. We know that existing GPU miners really care a lot about the issue.     greerso:  Tennagraph, 73% in favor coin voting, 87% in favor gas voting   Again, extremely small turnout: it looks like less than a couple ETH was probably spent on gas voting, and only a few hundred ETH seemed to have been involved in coin voting. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly how tennagraph is reporting its results though. All of this data is consistent with miners being extremely in favor of of ProgPow and being heavily over-represented in the metrics that you quoted. The tennagraph data actually provides some pretty good evidence that should make us question the support for ProgPow among the broader community: The one metric that\u2019s hardest to skew with selection effects is the voting of top influencers. Among 27 top influencers who voted, 48% are against ProgPow, 22% are for ProgPow, and 30% abstained. ",

The point is that when there are strong selection effects at work the distribution of votes doesn\u2019t tell you much. Consider a national vote about whether one penny should be taken from every citizen of the US and distributed evenly among 15 people. Those 15 people are going to vote yes, and perhaps no one else will vote at all because the hassle of voting isn\u2019t worth saving a penny to them. So you might see a vote of 15-0 in favor of this plan but can\u2019t infer that it\u2019s a good idea or that almost everyone supports it.     greerso:  \u201cInfluencers\u201d are literally the definition of a vocal minority.   The point is about whether top influencers are more likely to be representative of the community as a whole, as opposed to these other metrics. It\u2019s not completely clear, but there are arguments for why they would be: they\u2019re more likely to weigh in on hot topics even if they have no direct personal interest in the outcome, unlike with the other metrics. Why would we expect top influencers to be biased either for or against ProgPow? ",

The voting situation in Ethereum is really bad, since it\u2019s very difficult to identify who exact composes \u201cthe community\u201d. That\u2019s partially by design. We don\u2019t believe in plutocratic coin votes making final decisions, although we do use it to help aid sentiment analysis. The most relevant vote here is the miner vote because they are the most affected by this proposal, and have the most to lose by it\u2019s failure to be implemented. 77% have said yes, with 23% abstaining, which is probably about as good as it gets. As you stated, the only metric that is down was the \u201cinfluencer vote\u201d, which is akin to representative democracy except we didn\u2019t vote for these people and some of them don\u2019t really have credentials to back their opinions. In fact, most if not all in the \u201cno\u201d camp reference a blog post written years ago by one person, which may or may not be accurate as it contains several unverified opinions and is not a peer reviewed paper. The influencer sampling also did not take into account the result of the audit, which I think is an important factor for many and would affect the results if it were done again afterwards. I get it, sentiment analysis and understanding the \u201cvoice\u201d of the community is hard. It\u2019s made much harder by the psuedo-anonymous participation that defines public blockchains, especially when foregoing plutocratic on-chain voting structures. This is still a contentious issue, but I see more and more people moving in direction of support, even this late in the process. It seems to have a lot to do with education on the subject. Hardware design is an extremely complicated discipline, and difficult to describe simply. Most people understand the economic arguments better, and hearing about supply chain issues and access rights to purchase the underlying hardware is helpful too. It\u2019s better to have permissionless entry to the market of mining IMO, and I think many agree as well. ",

Audit  The last audit proposal I\u2019m aware of is still this one   github.com    Least%20Authority%20-%20ProgPow%20Algorithm%20Audit%20Proposal%20(v2).pdf       Curious if that has changed. What we\u2019ve learned from the RandomX audits so far is that the first thing you want to see from an auditor is a one-page or more explanation of the difference between a PoW algorithm and a cryptographic hash algorithm, as seen by the audit team. If the audit team doesn\u2019t see any difference, or is just guessing a bit and largely thinks they are reviewing a cryptographic hash algorithm, that will lead to a disappointing result.   raw.githubusercontent.com    Report-X41-20190705.pdf 381.40 KB       This is not enough. EIP 1057 makes some key claims that are demonstrably false, and yet were used to rally support behind the EIP, for example  \u201cThese would result in minimal, roughly 1.1-1.2x, efficiency gains.

Reputation  The fact that the EIP 1057 author is a close business associate of Calvin Ayre and the nChain camp is public knowledge today, and seems to be accepted for now. How do these guys make money? Step 1: Sell ETH short on bitmex and other exchanges Step 2: Put out press release saying Craig Wright co-authored and patented ProgPoW Step 3: profit  Hardware Accessibility  I was seriously surprised (and learning!) that someone could turn around the positive idea of not wanting to sell PoW hardware to ponzi schemes, scammers or money launderers into a \u201cblacklisting\u201d argument, and use that to instill more ASIC fear! Amazing. Here\u2019s what happens if a PoW hardware maker acts irresponsibly: A rogue megafarm is selling hashrate to unsuspecting retail customers at excessive setup and maintenance rates, and thus \u2018inherits\u2019 the capex for free after a few months when the difficulty goes up and the inability of their customers (victims) to calculate becomes apparent. They then proceed to destroy or otherwise manipulate/dominate that coin since their focus is on short-term profits. A hashrate owner that obtained hashrate for free, through whatever means, is a threat to the coin. Responsible chipmakers don\u2019t sell to these kinds of farms, because they act against the long-term interests of the coin that is being secured. Nvidia focuses on the short-term, since everybody knows that GPUs stand no chance in a PoW algo in the long run. ",

I respect all of these people, especially in their relevant domains of expertise, but unfortunately on this issue many of these voices do not have the relevant exposure to the details to make a real decision. I should know, because I was one of them months ago. I changed my mind by reading the facts and understanding the nuance of the discussion, and arrived at the result that I was wrong, and this proposal is helpful to the security of the network, which is the end goal we\u2019re seeking here. I really do not mean to offend anyone in saying this, but reasoning about hardware and the protocol layer and PoW algorithms and all the incentives at play is a very difficult and nuanced topic, and not something you can just pick up, even if you are very smart. Especially hardware design, which we have preciously few people in our community with that expertise, and they\u2019re all here trying to explain to us why this is so important. Out of the list you gave, perhaps only 2 or 3 have spent any amount of depth on the topic, and only one has written a long-form article on the subject. There are no academic papers to reference on the subject, and none of the claims made have been independently verified or disproven, making all of this harder. So, I don\u2019t think appeals to authority (aka influencer\u2019s opinions) is a good move here.      elliot_olds:  Unless this has changed in the past few months, the core developers have made almost no effort (as reflected in dev calls that I reviewed) to actually determine if ASIC resistance is desirable.   Besides the fact that it\u2019s written in the Ethereum Yellowpaper (and thus a core design goal of Ethereum via Ethash), \u201cASIC resistance\u201d is definitely a misnomer for something else. What we\u2019re trying to achieve is a low barrier to entry to mining. GPUs are great for this (despite what Sonia is telling us) because the supply chains are pretty open, and I can obtain hardware through retail channels anywhere in the world. There is also an element of robustness, since those in countries like Venezuela and China, where the authorities confiscate mining equipment by force (on occasion), you can at least try the \u201cbut it\u2019s an AI training rig!\u201d defense. The economies of scale of R&D and hardware production is hopefully such that, economically, it won\u2019t make sense to produce an ASIC.

Everyone should read this, to understand the issues that ASIC PoW brings about  https://t.co/Zwaf2EPLMh  \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffcI summarize some of the article's best points blow\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc  3:33 PM - 8 Jul 2019     59          16                  elliot_olds:  There is no reason to favor incumbents just because they\u2019re incumbents.   I hear this sentiment argued a lot, I feel like the majority of dissenters hold this view. Regardless, it\u2019s not about supporting the incumbents, it\u2019s about ensuring our current security providers, which is a more politically decentralized group of miners with the ability to reuse or sell their hardware at less of a loss (GPU miners can be repurposed to other coins and use cases, right?) stay in power, making an easier transition to PoS. Private hardware manufacturers are more politically organized and can move faster than our community can, which, coupled with a strong incentive to continue profiting off of selling specialized hardware for Ethereum mining, will oppose the move to PoS tooth and nail. One just needs to look how hard they are fighting to blackball this proposal to get a sense of the tactics that will be used in the coming years to oppose the transition to PoS.  Obviously, I\u2019m not going to convince anyone who is already convinced of their point of view, but I hope a few take the opportunity to deeply explore the evidence, learn a little bit about the economics of hardware manufacturing and PoW mining, and arrive independently at their own understanding of what is best in this scenario: allowing specialized mining hardware to take over our network\u2019s security, or maintaining the \u201cstatus quo\u201d which has been working for a while without too much of a problem.

                    "content": "I think you\u2019ll find in this discussion thread and many others that we are all ultimately in agreement on these principles:  Protect against existential threats Ensure the network is technically stable and adheres to the social contract for all stakeholders Ensure the future technical roadmap of Ethereum is as easy to implement as possible  However, we seem to disagree on the particulars, and that is where the contention comes from.  A failure to act (letting market forces take over) is an existential threat because it eventually trades a known group of stakeholders (GPU miners) for an unknown one (ASIC manufacturers). We cannot know how this new group of stakeholders will participate in our ecosystem or how it will change the game theory of network operation, but based on what we\u2019ve seen so far I am not optimistic that they will participate in good faith. In this scenario, holding the \u201cstatus quo\u201d would be actively taking steps to ensure our current set of stakeholders remains profitable, and the balance is maintained. Transitioning to new hardware will cause instabilities both technically and socially as we adjust to the newer paradigm. There is also the issue of breaking the current social contract with miners (who are stakeholders) as the Yellowpaper states that Ethereum prefers GPU mining, at least until the transition to PoS. Our current miners understand this, perhaps more than most. As I stated above, the transition to a new set of stakeholders may put our transition to PoS in jeopardy. Our current group of miners understands this risk, but the new group of ASIC manufacturers are private, for-profit companies with much different incentives that are aligned with selling hardware for our ecosystem, and not ensuring our ecosystem thrives long-term. Like it or not, mining is pretty close to a zero-sum game, with large cost overheads from hardware and power, so the only ways to make money is either through economies of scale or speculation on the underlying token. However, GPU economies of scale are very difficult, so token speculation is the primary way Ethereum miners make real profits, which means their interests become aligned with the network. I\u2019m not saying they should get special treatment as investors in our ecosystem or anything, but I feel as they should have just as much of a say as any other investor has. Some of these miners may eventually participate as Validators under PoS, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re selling the future to pay for the present here.  Yes, this issue is contentious, and some prominent voices disagree, mostly on principles that are difficult to validate in reality. However, Ethereum should not be afraid of contentious change, because if we are it does not bode well for the long-term scalability of our platform. We should find a way to work together and find compromise that improves things for the better. That is what makes us better than other chains.  My compromise: ensure ProgPoW is technically and economically viable, and can be enabled quickly on all major clients. Maybe development other algorithms. Use the threat of an algorithm change as a deterrent to further ASIC development, and find metrics everyone can agree on for when such activity comprises an \u201cexistential threat\u201d. Then, act on that threat (as we have done before) to ensure the long-term stability and future of our platform. ",

We will need at least 6 months, if not longer, to validate that the mechanism is working correctly, and develop the technical upgrades necessary to compensate for the issuance reduction and resolve all outstanding issues with issuance in general (rectifying the fact that we have two assets).

The tactics of team ProgPoW are tough, I have sympathy for the significant amount of time you invest in this and that you believe them. It\u2019s a nice campaign and attack pulled off by ProgPoW, and for sure they will never stop. The moment you hand them a mic, the story is back on.

After discussions and news in recent months, it\u2019s a given for us now that ProgPoW is a corporate money-making attempt, brought to you by one mega-miner with special deals with Nvidia on the chip side, and Calvin Ayre/nchain on the customer side. GPU miners not part of the collusion between Nvidia and Core Scientific will suffer. We are not in 2015 when Ethash was designed and audited. Today Ethereum pays out 100 mio USD / month for decentralized PoW security. The days of \u201clow barrier of entry to mining\u201d are over unless Ethereum dramatically changes the incentives and PoW algorithm (not to ProgPoW, to something that actually does what it says). The minimum size to be viable is 10 MW today.  Use the threat of an algorithm change as a deterrent to further ASIC development  Our Ethash ASIC development will continue. We are a chipmaker. We don\u2019t design chips for or against Ethereum, or for or against Ethereum Classic, Zilliqa, Bitcoin Cash, etc. I will happily work on long-form answers to serious questions such as what drives our chip decisions, what is hard and easy in chip design, what is costly and what is cheap, what the customers want, what about prepay, what about risk wafers, etc. We are also learning, it\u2019s painfully obvious that our time estimate back from the ETC Summit was wrong! It would be far more interesting to discuss how an Ethash (or ProgPoW) asic could lead to chips that accelerate ETH2. The investment carries over, so even if there is zero market for Ethash or ProgPoW, then the technology will be used to accelerate ETH2. ",

                    "content": "    fubuloubu:  but reasoning about hardware and the protocol layer and PoW algorithms and all the incentives at play is a very difficult and nuanced topic, and not something you can just pick up, even if you are very smart.   I think \u201cthe incentives at play\u201d is the part of this that people disagree about the most. Even if people agree with the ProgPow advocates on everything else, disagreement about this can determine where people stand on the issue. It is this that I don\u2019t see ProgPow advocates having any more expertise than opponents on. Does Kristy have a more expert opinion about this than Phil Daian? If so, why? The other big thing that people disagree about is the governance precedent. A lot of opponents don\u2019t think ProgPow is that big of a deal, but they object to letting a special interest push through a disruptive change and create a ~1 year distraction to benefit themselves.     fubuloubu:  I don\u2019t think appeals to authority (aka influencer\u2019s opinions) is a good move here   I came into this discussion because someone claimed that the community was clearly in favor of ProgPow now. Influencers are relevant because what\u2019s at issue is what the community sentiment is. The other metrics that have been pointed to are more vulnerable to selection effects than the influencer list, as described in my McDonalds example.     fubuloubu:  What we\u2019re trying to achieve is a low barrier to entry to mining.   That is a means, not an end. Just like decentralization is a means for censorship resistance. What we\u2019re really trying to do is lower the probability and severity of future attacks on Ethereum. In her Medium article, Kristy focuses a lot on decentralization but doesn\u2019t really engage with the issue of how the cost for an external actor to attack the network is higher with ASICs. She mentions it only in passing before moving on to say that what\u2019s even more important is protecting against attacks from ASIC miners rather than external actors. This is a big point of disagreement: what are we more worried about, people from outside the ecosystem attacking Ethereum or mining companies attacking it? Despite my disagreements, Kristy deserves props for engaging with the arguments of ProgPow opponents. This article is the kind of thing we should have been debating before ProgPow got the tentative go-ahead. IMO the next step now is to get feedback on these arguments from ProgPow opponents.     fubuloubu:  Here\u2019s a tweet thread walking through the motivation behind ProgPoW by @TrustlessState. I had not seen him support ProgPoW before, and he did a good job summarizing it.   He\u2019s just listing the points in Kristy\u2019s article, but thanks, that is one example of a former ProgPow opponent switching sides. Any other examples?     fubuloubu:  it\u2019s about ensuring our current security providers, which is a more politically decentralized group of miners with the ability to reuse or sell their hardware at less of a loss (GPU miners can be repurposed to other coins and use cases, right?) stay in power, making an easier transition to PoS.   This is one theory, but it\u2019s not clear that mining companies are a bigger threat than GPU miners. GPU miners are more integrated into the community and can create a more \u201cgrass roots\u201d resistance to PoS, which will look more legitimate than opposition coming from a big mining firm. If GPU miners resist PoS they won\u2019t dispute that PoS has always been on the roadmap but they may say \u201cPoS isn\u2019t ready yet \u2013 it needs more work and research. We shouldn\u2019t gamble with the network quite yet.\u201d     fubuloubu:  One just needs to look how hard they are fighting to blackball this proposal to get a sense of the tactics that will be used in the coming years to oppose the transition to PoS.   I don\u2019t see mining companies in general fighting hard against this. Linzhe is fighting but they seem quite small and without much influence, and they make up just a small minority of the opposition I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019ve also been ignoring ProgPow for a few months though, so maybe I\u2019ve missed some stuff. I do see lots of GPU miners with conflicts of interest relentlessly trying to push this through against the objections of mostly devs and app developers (like me and those I listed above) who don\u2019t seem to have any conflict of interest that I\u2019ve seen brought to light. I am skeptical that either GPU miners or ASIC companies have much hope of resisting PoS, and I think it\u2019s unlikely that anything that bad would happen if ProgPow does go through (even though I think it\u2019s worse overall for Ethereum\u2019s security). But I am pretty concerned about the governance precedent of allowing a special interest to push through a contentious change for such a questionable benefit. I\u2019m also concerned that there seems to have been very little acknowledgment of the conflicts of interest that do exist in this debate. For instance miners coming onto the dev calls to lobby for this and being treated as just normal concerned community members. ",

Anyone with an efficient bitstream or ASIC is incentivized to keep it secret.   @greerso I have 4 pieces of feedback regarding FPGA  mining on Ethash. I would like to know what evidence you have to support the claim that there are FPGA miners on ETH? 1. Memory bandwidth limitations on FPGA FPGA\u2019s are not viable for mining ETH as they are memory interface bandwidth bound. From a high level, Xilinx FPGA\u2019s eg. VU9P/11P/13P chips, U200/250 boards and 1525 boards support DDR4 in up to 256 bits wide (depending on board layout). The DDR4 limitation makes FPGA\u2019s uncompetitive (to low cost GPU\u2019s like the RX580 at $100 street price compared to $3500-$10000+ for 1525 and U250 boards). I can do the bandwidth math if you need it but it\u2019s too early in the morning. You may be able to get GDDR5 and GDDR6 memory controller IP but I am unable to validate whether such IP exist and whether the business model is viable (ie. licensing fees). Internet searches yield zero hits on Xilinx boards with GDDR5 and GDDR6 memory. 2. Economics of mining on moderately priced FPGA Most of the commercial FPGA miners are using VU9P or 1525 like boards. The ROI is relative long at $3500+/board for DRR4 or GDDR5 performance if you accept my memory bound assertion. Assume than the board is 50W and equivalent to RX570 at 30MH/s and you get an annual return of $12/month or $120/year which translates to 30 years ROI. Why would you not mine SHA3 or X11 or other Altcoins with higher returns? 3. Secret mining on FPGA The hardware  acquisition cost of VU9P and 1525 boards (now discontinued) are very high relative to ROI period. Why would you secret mine on FPGA when the hardware cost are so high at $3500+ per board? If someone had a viable FPGA bitstream, they should sell the ETH bitstream and try to monetize the NPV (net present value) of the mining rewards for some portion of it by licensing the bitstream. However, you can NOT make enough money by mining ETH on FPGA\u2019s \u2026 but then you will not sell any bitstreams if FPRGA performance levels are similar to GPU\u2019s. 4. Known FPGA ETH miracles There are 2 known FPGA ETH hardware fairy tales. They are: A. Ubimust in Montreal with a 1.9GHs hash rate claim The claim was widely echoed on the internet but the rig based on the 8x1525 boards never shipped and Ubimust does not list this product on their website. It is technicially impossible to get this type of performance on DDR4 memory.  https://ubimust.comh B. Squirrel Research - Acorn boards There was a claim by SQRL that ETH performance would be improved by 30% using low end FPGA board to offload Keccak processing from a GPU. Needless to say, this product did not work and the bitstream never shipped. Rumour has it that Kristie-Leigh aka OhGodAGirl of ProgPOW fame was involved in the bitstream development through her Mineority connections with SQRL. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4391318.740 ",

                    "content": "    elliot_olds:  Does Kristy have a more expert opinion about this than Phil Daian? If so, why?   Yes, because she (and many of the miners advocating) has direct experience working in the industry, including experience with the supply chain aspects of mining, hardware design, and has spent time with some of the hardware manufacturers in the industry. Everyone has been calling it \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, but expertise and CoI are two sides of the same coin. Phil has expertise in software security and compilers and many other things, but there is something to be said for practical experience with hardware vendors, running a mining operation, etc. As I said before, I respect both people\u2019s opinions on the matter.     elliot_olds:  they object to letting a special interest push through a disruptive change   This is the unfortunate side effect of the fact that not doing anything is also favoring a special interest, and sets a governance precedent that we are incapable of making tough decisions and thus can successfully be controlled into inaction by that special interest in the name of \u201cnot picking sides\u201d. At some point, you gotta make decisions.     elliot_olds:  how the cost for an external actor to attack the network is higher with ASICs.   ASICs have higher efficiency than GPUs, so really what you are getting is an increased hashrate for about the same marginal cost and energy expenditure. Therefore, ASICs do not have a higher cost than GPUs in that regard, it takes the same amount of money to purchase 51% of the hashrate no matter what hardware is used. The amount of cost expended is directly related to the amount offered by mining rewards, which is why we call it the \u201csecurity budget\u201d. ASICs don\u2019t change that math. What does change is the number of people operating that hardware, and the number of people you have to convince politically to do an attack. People talk about \u201crental attacks\u201d with GPU hardware and reference the ETC 51% attack. In that scenario, you would need a large number of GPU miners to feel apathic about Ethereum mining and list their hashpower up for rent. As long as we remain the largest and most profitable use of GPU hashpower, this really shouldn\u2019t be possible. Using Bitcoin for example, the number of political entities you need to convince is less. When CZ wanted to reorg the Bitcoin chain and steal back Binance\u2019s money, he didn\u2019t try to assemble a large and political diverse group of ASIC miners through hashrate rental, he talked to the mining pool operators that he knew and most notably Bitmain, who has a large portion of the Bitcoin mining hardware market (and operate a large amount of machines themselves). Ultimately, he relented because of community sentiment against the idea, but he definitely could\u2019ve made it happen, and a less benevolent actor acting in the dark with the right incentive might not react that way. This is the kind of attack scenario I worry about.     elliot_olds:  Any other examples?   I\u2019m one, and I think Martin Swende changed his mind over the course of the last few ACD to be for the proposal. I believe a majority of \u201ccore developers\u201d are for this proposal, and not because of a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d, unless simply talking to a person is enough to get you painted as having a CoI.     elliot_olds:  If GPU miners resist PoS they won\u2019t dispute that PoS has always been on the roadmap but they may say \u201cPoS isn\u2019t ready yet \u2013 it needs more work and research. We shouldn\u2019t gamble with the network quite yet.\u201d   This is a fair point. Any grassroots campaign (even one paid for by mining hardware manufacturers) is likely to have this sort of effect. At some point we\u2019ll have to make tough decisions to do things like reduce the mining reward. If we\u2019re incapable of making tough decisions now, it does not bode well for when we reach that point.     elliot_olds:  I do see lots of GPU miners with conflicts of interest relentlessly trying to push this through against the objections of mostly devs and app developers   I have a confession to make: I earned $40 worth of ETH from mining with my desktop in 2017. That was my first experience with Ethereum. It took me a month to do it though, so I figured I\u2019d be better off earning money from working on core infrastructure for Ethereum and being an application developer. But I understand that $40 I earned 2 years ago and the fact I support this proposal is enough to paint me with the dreaded CoI scarlet letters. Seriously, why can\u2019t people just evaluate things for themselves instead of painting CoI on everything they disagree with? It makes for piss-poor discussions.     elliot_olds:  I\u2019m also concerned that there seems to have been very little acknowledgment of the conflicts of interest that do exist in this debate. For instance miners coming onto the dev calls to lobby for this and being treated as just normal concerned community members.   Everyone has a Conflict of Interest in a network where everyone has their own self interests or the interests of their companies at stake. If we cannot understand that and take it into account in the decision-making process, instead of sticking our fingers in our ears whenever we see those CoI scarlet letters, how are we ever supposed to make contentious decisions? I\u2019m sorry for getting worked up over this, but CoI is my least favorite term and it\u2019s how we\u2019ve forced other important community members out before. Good decision makers can take these things into account without relying on it as the crux of their argument. ",

                    "content": "@elliot_olds  what are we more worried about, people from outside the ecosystem attacking Ethereum or mining companies attacking it?  Are Core Scientific and nChain inside or outside the ecosystem? I think you want to decrease the chance of attack (increase the cost of attack) of any single entity, whether inside or outside the ecosystem. The best way to get there is sustained competition between as many parties as possible aiming for both cryptographically and thermodynamically provable PoW. \u201cParties\u201d means anyone from chipmakers to machine/system integrators to hosters/miners/mining companies to mining pools.  Despite my disagreements, Kristy deserves props for engaging with the arguments of ProgPow opponents.  Kristy is your attack vector, from within. They created the problem (threat) they are now pretending to fix. When someone comes and tries to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist, think harder. You may need to do more than just say \u201cno thanks\u201d. When the ASIC fear campaign started, global Ethash hashrate was 265.8 TH (May 30, date of the article), and today it\u2019s 177.9 TH. Why? The #1 problem with PoW: It\u2019s open to the kind of social attack ProgPoW is pulling off. If you are loosing on the hashrate, who said you can\u2019t try something creative to fight back?  [Linzhi seems to be] quite small and without much influence  True, and good. PoW is a service to the network.  For instance miners coming onto the dev calls to lobby for this and being treated as just normal concerned community members.  Have you found out the identities of Mr. Def and Mr. Else? Does the community agree with the verification slowdown due to ProgPoW and its impact on light clients? ProgPoW was kicked off by Nvidia, initially staffed with about 15 people in total. It seems to be a rather standard attempt by Nvidia to control a market using proven marketing. Forget what they say about being volunteers and the fake disclaimers under their articles.  attacks from ASIC miners rather than external actors.  You mean \u201cASIC miners\u201d as in people already running Bitmain E3 today? Hashrate is impartial, you always want the hashrate distributed between as many different parties as possible (logically and physically separated). Maybe you are assuming that someone who is already mining on the network today is less likely to attack than a new/external miner? In that case you are excluding the possibility that ProgPoW was brought forward by one large existing miner to become even larger, and be able to dominate the network and extract value at will. The chance of an existing miner with known-good intentions today turning bad is equal to the chance of a new miner joining with either good or bad intentions from the beginning.  doesn\u2019t really engage with the issue of how the cost for an external actor to attack the network is higher with ASICs  Buying hashrate is always the most expensive (and for new hardware also slowest) way to attack a network. From most to least expensive you have: 1. buy 2. rent 3. steal There are some smart (as in business-smart) ways that are close to #3 such as financing a purchase and then not paying. ProgPoW is also close to #3 because it steals hashrate from the network by excluding ASICs and thus increases the relative share of the hashrate of the ProgPoW proponents. ProgPoW thus reduces the attack costs (which I believe is the intention). I believe the best way to increase (internal or external) attack cost is competition between chipmakers, but I should think about a long-form article to make that point. If all parties (from chipmaker to pool) are under competitive pressure, noone will be able to accumulate enough profit to dominate the entire system. There will be no centralization, and attack costs will be high.  What we\u2019re really trying to do is lower the probability and severity of future attacks on Ethereum.  ProgPoW increases the probability and severity of attacks.  This article is the kind of thing we should have been debating before ProgPow got the tentative go-ahead.  You didn\u2019t? Some comments, quoting the article (KLM for Kristy):   KLM: The equation for [PoW\u2019s goal of preventing network centralization] was a combination of cryptographic math, philosophy, psychology and resource costs inherent with hardware   It is a combination of cryptographic math and thermodynamic competition.   KLM: [ProgPoW] is designed to target a critical part of the centralization problem: specialized hardware.   Red herring. The definition of specialized hardware doesn\u2019t hold under any kind of critical analysis. It\u2019s meant to distract from the fact that GPU mining machines are as specialized as ASIC mining machines. The GPU chips that are used for Ethash mining today are built into highly specialized hardware, from special firmware to specially tuned memory to special cards to special machines. None of it is resellable or reusable outside of mining. Rationally thinking about hardware means thinking about cost, hashrate and power consumption. Then there is also order lead time and reliability, but they seem to be of lesser importance in the Ethereum PoW context.   KLM: Specialization comes from removing unnecessary parts of hardware   Contradicts her own F1 racing car example later on. If you keep removing from a 4WD, will you eventually have an F1 car? Specialization comes from designing a machine with only one goal in mind.   KLM: When people talk about ASIC resistance, what they really mean is \u201ccentralization resistance\u201d. That\u2019s an important distinction to make, because the problem isn\u2019t the hardware itself \u2014 it\u2019s the companies and incentives behind it.   Yes. What are the incentives of Core Scientific?   KLM: network security is relative to the amount of energy spent   Network security is relative to the amount of energy spent efficiently.   KLM: Making specialized hardware means you\u2019ve gamed the mining metric in a way that encourages everyone to buy more   Buy more until a maximum is reached. That is called competition, and why PoW is not only cryptographically, but also thermodynamically provable.   KLM: [analogy of a car race between a 4WD and an F1 racing car]   The F1 analogy fails to think through the alternative: If everyone is forced to stay with the 4WD (GPU), the attack vector (the F1 car) is still possible technically. The security (inability to be outcompeted) was reduced. PoW is thermodynamically provable, or it\u2019s not PoW.   KLM: The energy-to-work ratio is the same. The network isn\u2019t anymore secure.   Who is the judge to check that none of the 4WD got any secret tuning? The network is more secure if the competition is open between the 4WD and the F1, because an attack vector (the F1 car) was eliminated. And maybe the higher reliability of the 4WD means it\u2019s more competitive to the F1 car than anyone would have thought.   KLM: Bitmain is a corporation, and that means it has a duty: to maximize returns for investors. They\u2019re chasing their incentives, and that incentive is to make money.   s/Bitmain/Core Scientific/   KLM: Creating incentives for the security mechanism to dominate the network growth is just, well, letting the tail wag the dog.   Right, that\u2019s why ProgPoW should be rejected. PoW is a service to the network, not the other way round. ProgPoW is the tail wagging the Ethereum dog.   KLM: This means the first manufacturer of custom hardware naturally has full control of the hashrate   This is already proven wrong by how long it took to bring the Bitmain E3 (and then Inno A10) to market and the lack of competitiveness with GPUs. I did a lot of math around this earlier in this thread. Even if the ETH coin price would jump to 5,000 USD today, the network would still be secured by the same installed base of over 5 mio GPUs and it would take at least a year or more for ASICs to gain significant hashrate share. Before then even more GPUs would have rushed into the market bringing the difficulty up and slowing down the income of ASICs. None of this touches any of the software devs\u2019 ability to change anything - protocol, PoW algo, mining rewards within a much shorter timeframe, if they want to.   KLM: By impeding the network (see the empty-block example above), these miners and hardware manufacturers become the attackers by extracting value to the detriment of the network. Worse, their attack on the coin is constant and pervasive \u2014 a cancerous element that extends even to blogs and forums outside of the blockchain, where they spread misinformation and fearmonger to hide their motives and damage they do.   Freudian slip. To be more blunt: That\u2019s the most vivid executive summary anyone could imagine about ProgPoW.   KLM: Specialized ASIC makers and the miners who buy specialized hardware have guided the evolution of Bitcoin into a version of the traditional banking system, where they now hold all the keys.   Double false. First, the author is (today) CTO of a specialized machine mining company, and yet it\u2019s not enough to dominate and profit, so they are trying community infiltration and PoW change instead.   KLM: As GPUs drop off due to loss of profitability, centralization will accrue around specialized hardware creators. Once this happens they can use attacks\u2026   Circular reasoning at its best. How did the GPUs end up where they are today? Why is the \u201cspecialized hardware\u201d somewhere else? Who are \u201cthey\u201d? This makes no sense at all. Specialized hardware is a misnomer, Kristy has expressed many times how fond she is of her drive towards specialization, how open minded about ASICs, etc.   KLM: Specialized Defenses: Some would suggest algorithm stacking \u2014 found in coins such as RavenCoin, where the algorithms are repeatedly chained in randomized orders. However, Baikal has proven with their hardware (specifically the BK-X) that a bit of silicon area for each algorithm is all that is needed (and a sequencer, to distribute the order)   For RavenCoin, it\u2019s just \u201ca bit of silicon for each algorithm and a sequencer to distribute the order\u201d. But for ProgPoW, it\u2019s guaranteed to be proof-of-GPU. Really?   KLM: every algorithm that exists today has an optimal \u2018design\u2019 in hardware that can\u2019t effectively be surpassed   Obviously false. Is this worth discussing? You are either designing an algorithm for a chip, or a chip for an algorithm. If you don\u2019t change the algorithm, the latter will always beat the prior thermodynamically. We wrote a nice 5-step article how we would find a good (the best we can think of) design of a chip for a given algorithm.    Medium \u2013 11 Mar 19   Studying the Feasibility of an ASIC - Linzhi ASICs - Medium Can you make an ASIC for algorithm X? How fast can it be? Can it be better than Y? Reading time: 3 min read          KLM:  That\u2019s the key to decentralized mining \u2014 leverage existing markets which are bigger and already decentralized. When your hardware isn\u2019t specialized, the hardware starts, and stays, distributed.   Doesn\u2019t explain why Nvidia would leave money on the table. Throughout their 25yr history of gaining a 70% market share in GPUs they have demonstrated a ruthless attitude to making money. Given its history we must assume, and ProgPoW proves, that Nvidia will try to keep mining centralized with them, gamify Ethereum and turn devs into unpaid support staff.   KLM: to adapt the math in infinite and unpredictable patterns   It can\u2019t be that unpredictable, because it has to be verifiable.   KLM: Once you understand how economic incentives help or harm cryptocurrency networks, it\u2019s easy to see how best to keep things truly decentralized   Right. Cost advantage leads to centralization. ",

They might know some factors that affect incentives that aren\u2019t obvious to people outside of the industry, but after they reveal these factors to Phil and others they\u2019re back on an even playing field in terms of their ability to analyze the incentives.     fubuloubu:  ASICs have higher efficiency than GPUs, so really what you are getting is an increased hashrate for about the same marginal cost and energy expenditure   That is not at all what I\u2019m saying. GPU coins are more expensive for an external actor to attack to the extent that a higher percentage of the required mining capacity can be rented (even if not enough rental supply is available to get to 51% \u2013 any difference in rental supply affects cost to attack).     fubuloubu:  People talk about \u201crental attacks\u201d with GPU hardware and reference the ETC 51% attack. In that scenario, you would need a large number of GPU miners to feel apathic about Ethereum mining and list their hashpower up for rent.   The thing about GPUs is that it\u2019s not only crypto miners that use GPUs. The fact that you can rent GPUs from AWS and other generic cloud providers reduces the cost of an attack vs. if you couldn\u2019t rent any hash-power. This is true even if all the GPU capacity for rent still isn\u2019t enough to come close to 51% attacking ETH on its own \u2013 it still makes the attack cheaper if you can rent some of what you need.     fubuloubu:  But I understand that $40 I earned 2 years ago and the fact I support this proposal is enough to paint me with the dreaded CoI scarlet letters.   I don\u2019t think so. I certify you as free from having a significant CoI, assuming you disclosed all the relevant info.     fubuloubu:  Seriously, why can\u2019t people just evaluate things for themselves instead of painting CoI on everything they disagree with? It makes for piss-poor discussions.   I think what makes for piss-poor discussions is people acting defensively whenever a CoI is mentioned, and acting like it\u2019s some sort of assault on their character. CoIs are properties of the situation regardless of how uncorrupted any individuals in question are, and they are very relevant. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for you to use your own insignificant CoI to suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter much that a lot of people in this debate have real and significant CoIs. It\u2019s not a big deal for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not a big deal when it comes to others who are pushing for this.     fubuloubu:  Everyone has a Conflict of Interest in a network where everyone has their own self interests or the interests of their companies at stake.   No \u2013 everyone has an interest, but people only have a conflict of interest to the extent that their own interest is in conflict with the interest of others. I have an interest in ETH being valuable, in ETH being widely used for decentralized apps, and in ETH being hard to attack. This isn\u2019t much of a conflict of interest because the broader ETH community generally has the same interests as me with respect to those things. In contract, the interest of miners do conflict to a higher degree with the interests of the broader community, especially as it relates to ProgPow.     fubuloubu:  instead of sticking our fingers in our ears whenever we see those CoI scarlet letters, how are we ever supposed to make contentious decisions?   Who is sticking their fingers in their ears? CoIs should be acknowledged and factored into the analysis of the situation. What I see is miners and ProgPow advocates freaking out whenever someone brings up the CoI issue and refusing to acknowledge as legitimate and worth taking into account.     fubuloubu:  I\u2019m sorry for getting worked up over this, but CoI is my least favorite term and it\u2019s how we\u2019ve forced other important community members out before.   I\u2019ve also been extremely disappointed in how to CoI issue has been handled by the ETH community, but in my case it\u2019s because some people interpret any mention as CoIs as a personal attack and act like any mention of CoIs is out of bounds. I see this as a tactic to dismiss the legitimate relevance of CoIs.     fubuloubu:  Good decision makers can take these things into account without relying on it as the crux of their argument.   I agree \u2013 but what we\u2019ve seen is the core devs not taking CoIs into account at all. I may have missed things because I took a break from ProgPow for a while. If I missed it, where has the extent of the CoIs related to this issue been publicly discussed / acknowledged by the core devs? ",

Let\u2019s do a little more homework, I love this. Yesterday I pointed out some things in the \u201cProblem with PoW\u201d article. One key argument in the article are the many references to \u201cspecialized hardware\u201d. Here\u2019s what Kristy said about specialized hardware a few weeks ago (June 24, 2019, quotes from the video): https://coingeek.com/coingeek-toronto-conference-2019-kristy-leigh-minehan-on-bsv-mining-video/   CoinGeek \u2013 24 Jun 19    CoinGeek Toronto Conference 2019: Kristy-Leigh Minehan on BSV mining - CoinGeek Kristy Leigh Minehan explained to the Toronto crowd that BSV is giving miners a voice and giving them the right incentives. Est. reading time: 4 minutes        [7:33] Mining + Specialization = $$$ KLM: This is something I uphold very dear to myself. KLM: Specialized infrastructure has been at war with the home miner. KLM: So one of the things we do at Core Scientific is we invest heavily in infrastructure, and specifically we invest heavily in specialization. KLM: The other piece is optimization. So one of the things we also specialize in at Core Scientific is specifically reverse engineering firmware, figuring out how can we get more optimization out of it.  She actually says that she is at war with the home miner!  If you ask her, maybe she will tell you it\u2019s all different for GPUs (this talk is about BSV). Of course it\u2019s the same for GPUs! She will never stop, and it kind of makes sense. Why stop? You want to avoid that Ethereum will be controlled by nChain and Calvin Ayre/Craig Wright. ",

Hi Ethernian, that\u2019s not completely accurate. Actually any driver update may tamper with compiled code for any algo whereas there is an GPU implementation. It may happen for ethash too. This is something beyond the design of any algo and, in general, beyond the design of any piece of software when, to function, it relies on third parties components. Being very extreme : if a bug in a Linux kernel had to happen and this had impact on mining programs would you call it an algo flaw ? ProgPoW rules require a recompile of a portion of the code where operations are randomized (in type and order) from a well defined set which has been distilled from well known available math intrinsics for both major vendors (AMD and NVIDIA). This code is actually recompiled every 50 blocks (10+ minutes). Carrying out tests on ganganam network a former developer of ethminer I was working with discovered what was named \u201cthe bogus period\u201d issue affecting only AMD/OpenCL compilers. On such periods GPU kernels produced results which eventually failed double-check by CPU implementation. For those cases must be underlined that :  GPU binary code was compiled without issues GPUs \u201cthougth\u201d their solutions were correct so from their perspective the program was ok. The problem was observed only when \u201ccompiler optimizations\u201d were in place. Compiler optimizations are something beyond the design of an algo The work-around was a simple directive \u201climiting\u201d compiler optimization.  After work-around has been applied eventually gangnam network (before being withdrawn) sealed 1M blocks without further issues about the validity of solutions found. Another issue may arise from frequent compilation where on some drivers version for both major vendors you may stumble in the driver itself getting stuck due to memory exhausted. In that case though you won\u2019t have any \u201cbogus\u201d result rather no hashing at all. I consider this latter nothing dramatic as it\u2019s quite common to restart (reboot) GPU miners after some time. However is something workable simply adjusting how CPU code implements mining (eg. periodically un-load and reload driver\u2019s libraries). ",

The majority do NOT CARE about the algorithm used. Period. They do care if they get to participate on GPU mining or not on a particular algorithm. This entire argument, audit and investigation should be purely on the open source option presented. Does it function as it says, what are the potential attack vectors (could someone attack/take advantage of the series of events within the operations); if that can\u2019t get answered, then switch to SHA3 and/or some other variant. The general consensus from the folks that support GPU mining is pretty linear. Can they participate yes or no. If they can, they will continue to mine and provide a vibrant community of support and content creation around the proof of work collaborative and onboarding ecosystem, a community that helped, many in grassroot ways to be part and parcel of the growth of ethereum in their own way (getting friends, family and many as contributors to the total net hash through hundreds of millions of capex investment across the world, 4+ million GPUs) The position of anyone here is to simply ask the basic question, agnostic to the algorithm, is this something Ethereum Development community going to address (ASIC resistance) or not, cause yes, there are many that actually care.

Yes, my thoughts and opinions change based upon my experiences (good lord, what a shocking revelation!). Yes, for years, specialized infrastructure has been at war with the home miner. This is because specialized infrastructure generally has much larger economies of scale and pushes home miners out of the space. This is why infrastructure providers will slowly become service providers - the home miner will \u2018join them\u2019 and leverage their economies of scale and engineering effort, in the same way one leverages AWS or GCP. It still disappoints me that after half a year, you\u2019re still acting like an emotional individual rather than as a company. Multiple people in this thread - including some that are highly respected in the fields of ASIC development - have gone out of their way to engage with you respectfully. You proceed to attack them, no rhyme or reason. You do nothing to cultivate trust in your company or product for foreign markets. Taking statements out of context or attacking an individual relentlessly doesn\u2019t do a single thing to assist you. In fact, all it does is reflect poorly on yourself and your company. Your continued behaviour echos true of the statement IfDefElse made two years ago - single-purpose hardware manufacturers will go out of their way to protect their investments, whatever the cost. Everytime you attack myself, you strengthen ProgPoW and its merits - because if the best criticism that can come from it is my involvement, this will be a fairly easy audit. ",

I agree with you that simply pointing out a CoI is not a substitute for discussing an issue \u2013 it\u2019s just one factor out of many. One area where I think CoIs are especially relevant is in measuring community sentiment. As a reminder, I got into the thread again because someone claimed that it was not clear that the community supported ProgPow. The fact that GPU miners have a CoI is extremely relevant to how seriously we should take the fact that for instance 77% of haspower voted for ProgPow. That\u2019s hardly a convincing argument for broad community support when miners should be expected to be especially enthusiastic about ProgPow due to it directly benefiting them. I have yet to see any good metrics showing broad community support whose results can\u2019t be explained by there being a group of passionate miners pushing for ProgPow. ",

                    "content": " In her Medium article, Kristy focuses a lot on decentralization but doesn\u2019t really engage with the issue of how the cost for an external actor to attack the network is higher with ASICs. She mentions it only in passing before moving on to say that what\u2019s even more important is protecting against attacks from ASIC miners rather than external actors.  There are a lot of arguments that we never engaged in. I mentioned this before when ProgPoW was scheduled for inclusion in Istanbul - we did a bad job of producing educational material. This is no one\u2019s fault by our own. IfDefElse was a small team of enthusiasts with full-time jobs, and our jobs got in the way of helping to educate the space. We never intended ProgPoW to take on the life that it did - we simply put it out there with all the enthusiasm an engineer usually has over sharing their work, because it solved a problem we were passionate about. I\u2019ve generally stayed quiet because of the amount of attack on both my personal and professional life. If this space had engaged in professional discourse, I would have been more willing to engage in education. C\u2019est la vie.  This is a big point of disagreement: what are we more worried about, people from outside the ecosystem attacking Ethereum or mining companies attacking it?  The problem a lot of ProgPoW opponents fail to address is how scarce ASIC equipment is. Look at the current state of the Bitcoin mining network. It is near impossible for a U.S. miner to get new equipment without going through a broker, in any sort of volume. Most of the equipment is three to four months out. If you are a Chinese miner, you can get equipment with a snap of your fingers - there are natural favourtisms and buyer preference at play. But this is far more pronounced in the Bitcoin ecosystem than it is in the GPU system. Case in point: the RTX silicon was launched at the same time (give or take a month) for every region around the world. But the M21s was pre-sold in large batches before any consumer units were distributed. MicroBT and Canaan both advertise that they are moving towards the made-to-order model, rather than the made-to-stock model of GPU manufacturers. This is a key reason for my favouritism of GPUs. The inability to get new equipment punishes new entrants to the ecosystem and rewards veteran participants. With the recent impact of the trade war in the United States, it\u2019s now even more punishing to new miners in the ecosystem. Sure, I\u2019m biased here - I live in the US and work for a US-based company. But every single day I have new, enthusiastic entrants to mining hit me up on Twitter, asking where they can buy units now and get started in the community now. With ASICs, I have to point them towards a) a broker, of which most are unregulated and simply flip equipment for another middleman, or b) the manufacturer, who will not sell units of 1 or 2 to a loan individual. Most of the equipment has been out of stock on manufacturer\u2019s websites, or is available for purchase in bulk alone. Contrast this with a GPU. GPUs are stocked, at large, the world over. Yes, there was a shortage, because enthusiasts brought them off the shelves. But I can buy a GPU in the US, in Ukraine, in Russia, in South Africa\u2026all over, there are miners entering the ecosystem, because of the readily available hardware. You don\u2019t need to be an expert in this - you just need to understand that the economics are there. And yes, some of them do leave the network, but so do ASIC miners - by selling off their current equipment and buying new equipment. You can\u2019t use the \u2018skin in the game\u2019 argument, because there is always a way to get out of your \u2018contract\u2019 with a network. But this is healthy for a network when done properly - it forces coins to compete on product, community, and quality, rather than just on pure profit alone. Miners are either nomadic or tribalistic. If you capture on the tribalistic miners, they will stay with your network for its lifetime.  I think \u201cthe incentives at play\u201d is the part of this that people disagree about the most. Even if people agree with the ProgPow advocates on everything else, disagreement about this can determine where people stand on the issue. It is this that I don\u2019t see ProgPow advocates having any more expertise than opponents on. Does Kristy have a more expert opinion about this than Phil Daian? If so, why?  There aren\u2019t a lot of people that have been in mining since the beginning. Most have left the space, or went off to work in other verticals in blockchain. I am not saying I am authority, but I don\u2019t think a single person in this thread can\u2019t agree with this statement: mining is inherently tribalistic right now. Too much knowledge in this space is kept in secret. That is because it is a nascent industry (just like blockchain), and communication is hoarded. Phil might understand the theory (and I value his opinions and insight), but the reality is quite different. I am not saying I am the authority, but I am saying that all I can do is share my experiences and explain why I value ProgPoW - because how can I champion something if I don\u2019t believe in it?  I have yet to see any good metrics showing broad community support whose results can\u2019t be explained by there being a group of passionate miners pushing for ProgPow.  Most of them will not speak up. There are two reasons for this. One is that many people have seen the result of what happens when you go against a special interests party - @greerso himself was dox\u2019d, and quite a few non-Ethereum miners have signalled support but will not speak because their association with Ethereum would \u2018muddy\u2019 their image. The second is that, unless you are a part of the Ethereum \u2018core community\u2019, you don\u2019t know where to voice your opinions. For instance, where does the broader Chinese community engage or speak? It\u2019s not taking place on forums such as this one, or even on Twitter. We\u2019ve failed to capture the QQ, WeChat and LINE communities, all of which have thriving ecosystems that passionately debate this topic every single day. But, more to the point - why is it such a bad thing that miners speak about a mining related topic? Just like a developer topic would be rallied for by developers who understand the complexities and how the change will effect them, why is it seen as such a vulgar act when a change that will effect a user is met with passion for, or against it?

You commented publicly, several times, that Linzhi is \u201cnot to be believed because if what they say is true they would just go and do it and take the money\u201d. In the nicest words, that is a condescending argument. Are you implying that everyone is like this? How do I know you are not being paid under the table? In our interesting crypto space, some people try to define \u201crational\u201d as equal to \u201ccorruptible\u201d. I totally disagree. This kind of logic breaks all assumptions FOSS culture and crypto are built upon these last decades. I understand the difficulty of having a discourse over issues that are partially or largely intransparent, such as hardware. We have a long list of people that are free to apologize for all the nasty things they said about us in recent months. Luckily we made lots of new friends also. I fully expect you to take back the \u201cif what they say is true they would just take the money\u201d comment one day. Kristy sent out her minions to offer us up to 75 mio USD to participate in her scheme, we slammed the door on them. You would have done the same. I stand by everything me and my friends have contributed to the ProgPoW discourse since January, 100%. Some of it is a painful read, because the underlying issue is painful. We are at the beginning, because the points we made, technical and economical/business (the attack vector), have a basis and will show their true face over time. Humans are not very good at dealing with high complexity. So our brain uses a trick: simplification. Simplification happens unconsciously, one barely notices it. Simplification has one disadvantage: It doesn\u2019t create a closed and consistent logical structure. Then things become complicated again and the brain tries to disregard or treat things categorically, to reduce dissonance. If you use simplification consciously and controlled, it\u2019s abstraction. This is the key ability that is lacking in the discussion, and most importantly the decision making process. Everything is discussed momentarily. What\u2019s lacking are deeper, long-term and strategic thoughts that are then upheld.  Secure, proof-of-work, public blockchains are, and will always be, under constant social attack. https://etherplan.com/2019/05/17/ethereum-classic-and-the-permissionless-fallacy/7584/  ",

The inability to get new equipment punishes new entrants to the ecosystem and rewards veteran participants.   This issue doesn\u2019t seem that relevant to me. Our goal with mining is the security of the Ethereum network. Whether some miners are given an \u201cunfair\u201d advantage or not only matters to the extent that it affects security.     OhGodAGirl:  Miners are either nomadic or tribalistic. If you capture on the tribalistic miners, they will stay with your network for its lifetime.   I\u2019m somewhat skeptical that many GPU miners give up significant profits to mine on ETH just because they\u2019re loyal to it. What\u2019s the evidence for that? But even if it were true, I don\u2019t think ETH should rely on miners loyalty for its security.     OhGodAGirl:  why is it such a bad thing that miners speak about a mining related topic ? Just like a developer topic would be rallied for by developers who understand the complexities and how the change will effect them, why is it seen as such a vulgar act when a change that will effect a user is met with passion for, or against it?   It\u2019s not bad that they speak about it. If miners bring up arguments relating to ETH\u2019s security those arguments should be evaluated on their merits. But simply the fact that miners want ProgPow needs to be considered in light of their CoI. Again, go back to my example of MacDonalds supporting a law that will transfer $2 from every American to their company. This law impacts MacDonalds much more than anyone else. You could even say it\u2019s a \u201cMacDonalds-related\u201d law, and not much of a \u201cKristy-related law\u201d. So when you object and say \u201cHey, this seems just like a pointless giveaway to MacDonalds\u201d should they be able to claim their opinion has extra weight because they\u2019re most affected by the law?

It\u2019s too logical not to try. Make a list of possible motivations for a PoW change, and expect someone to start with the easiest and most profitable ones, the low hanging fruits. We talk about ProgPoW - Programmatic Proof-of-Work. Programmatic means \u2018according to a program\u2019. The rarely used \u2018programmatic\u2019 is then substituted by people for the more common \u2018programmable\u2019. Other confusing terms such as dynamic and random are mixed in. How can a PoW algo be programmable when it always needs to be verifiable? PoW is work that someone else can verify, so it cannot be programmable and will always fully derive from a seed, with a series of 100% predictable and repeatable steps. No matter which linguistic trickery someone may be trying to sell the story. Real innovation in PoW would allow user defined programs to be passed to the PoW algorithm, which would then need to be stored alongside the PoW result, and clients would need to construct a zero-knowledge proof to check that the program was fully executed (limiting CPU time). None of such real innovation is in ProgPoW, because all it is is superficial pseudo-technology trying to coverup a corporate scheme (follow the links, DYOR). We can do better, and we will never loose our optimism. ",

(CSE:SQR | FWB:9SQ | OTCQB:SQRMF) (\u201cSquire\u201d) is pleased to announce it...       I won\u2019t paraphrase, at this point it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s happening. The only thing we will most likely never see are the ProgPoW-related agreements between Nvidia and Core Scientific, and Core Scientific and Squire/nChain. If anyone wants to leak them, DM me. @OhGodAGirl That should be easy to denounce Craig Wright as a fraud. How many TH Ethash does Squire/Core Scientific control today, how much will they benefit from ProgPoW? You can ask the CTO right here, she will know and she\u2019s oh so trustworthy  I hope we don\u2019t see Ethereum in Coingeek conferences ever. For Kristy and her sockpuppets (Amel, Jean Cyr, Epic Henry, Teddy Ghannam, Jon Stevens, more created as needed - Andrew Au, Sarah Osbourne, \u2026), what remains is this: Zero facts, a lot of emotions - but what is the agenda?

The average GPU can do 24-30 MH/s, but the Linzhi ASIC is capable of 1400 MH/s. After factoring in power consumption, the difference in hash rate versus a GPU is astronomical.

                    "content": "@souptacular emailing progpow-audit@leastauthority.com didn\u2019t work for me (delivery failure, you may not have permission, may need to join, group may not be open to posting).  Referring to the initial audit, dated 16 August 2019 Key Omissions 1. Most of the Areas of Concern (p.3) not addressed: Security of the algorithm: \u201csecurity\u201d not defined. Cost of a 51% attack: No reasonable calculation attempted. Other security risks from a change of PoW: Not attempted. Impact on \u201cfair mining\u201d and uneven distribution: No calculation. Possible changes to hash power and miner balance: No data, no calculations. Other potential effects impacting the ecosystem: Not attempted. 2. No measurement for \u201ccentralization\u201d proposed or attempted How centralized is the 170 TH network today, how could one model the effect of ProgPoW towards centralization? 3. Background and motivation of ProgPoW proponents not considered The ProgPoW author is CTO of Craig Wright\u2019s hosting company Core Scientific. Together with two anonymous co-authors. The identities and motivations of the ProgPoW team remain a mystery and were left out of the audit. Serious consideration of Core Scientific\u2019s and Nvidia\u2019s business interests with regards to ProgPoW are warranted to understand security implications. 4. No definition of \u201cattack\u201d proposed PoW is a control vector for the entire decentralized network. Measurement of real-world centralization is a prerequisite for the mitigation of attacks. \u201cAttack\u201d needs to be defined. An optimization of the PoW algorithm, sold in an ASIC, is not an attack in our opinion. \u201cAttack\u201d is not when someone openly plays by the rules. \u201cAttacks\u201d come from behind. A trojan horse is an attack. 5. Economies of Scale The audit does not clarify whether economies of scale are seen as positive or negative factors towards decentralization. Details 1. Random & Pseudo-Random p.5 \u201cOur review and analysis results in our agreement that the KISS random number generator is sufficient to make the sequence of math in the main loop unpredictable\u201d KISS is a pseudo-randon number generator. The difference between random and pseudo-random is fundamental. The audit uses the term \u201crandom math\u201d 8 times. One would hope that everyone understands that this is pseudo-random and thus predictable. If it was unpredictable as the audit states, it would be unverifiable. With traditional PoW one needs to remember that no matter which calculation the algorithm performs, it needs to be verifiable, meaning it needs to derive from a seed. 2. Keccak optimized for 32-bit p.4 \u201cWe examined the hash function, a non-standard instance of the Keccak function that is optimized for 32-bit architectures\u201d The audit fails to ask the question why the change to the non-standard 32-bit optimization may have been made. With sufficient and actual study of the business interests of the parties involved and their potential agendas, we came to the conclusion that 32-bit multiplication was pushed under the pretense of it being inefficient on both Nvidia and AMD but that turns out to be a lie as on Nvidia it was only inefficient on Pascal. The algorithm is tuned to still let Pascal utilize full memory bandwidth due to simply sheer compute capacity difference coming partially from higher die size which is why comparing GPUs based on price is being pushed as of late. It\u2019s not a secret that 4xx & 5xx series AMD GPUs are not high-end but because ProgPoW\u2019s compute to memory bandwidth ratio is tuned to match Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs are not utilized to their fullest, most importantly losing the full memory bandwidth utilization which is the very basic foundation of the Ethash algorithm. 3. Limiting Efficiency Gains p.7 \u201cthe circumstances in ProgPoW are much more favorable due to the additional random math core\u201d p.7 \u201cthe random math core likely prohibits the build of a light-evaluation based ASIC\u201d p.8 \u201cthe additional use of random math sequences extends the ASIC resistance of Ethash substantially\u201d These statements support the key ProgPoW claim (from the EIP) that ProgPoW results in \u201cminimal, roughly 1.1-1.2x, efficiency gains. This is much less than the 2x for Ethash\u201d. Both the EIP claim as well as the auditor\u2019s confirmation of that claim are wrong. The pseudo-random math core increases the efficiency gains an ASIC can achieve, because an ASIC can implement the math logic more efficiently than a GPU. 4. Sarah Osbourne p.17 \u201cSarah Osbourne Response to the Linzhi ASIC post\u201d The audit cites the Sarah Osbourne response in the rather short list of third party resources consulted for the audit. How can an account that was created the day before the post, and has since only posted that one response purporting to possess highly specific knowledge about ProgPoW and GPU/ASIC design, not be further scrutinized? Who is \u201cSarah Osbourne\u201d, who pays her/him/them, what is the agenda? If the people that are behind \u201cSarah Osbourne\u201d are in fact Nvidia or Core Scientific employees, writing under pseudonym has the pleasant side-effect of not even affecting their reputation, shall the response be proven wrong. We would just prove \u201cSarah Osbourne\u201d wrong, an anonymous one-post-only person from the Internet. Then the next anonymous person would show up with new claims. What is happening here is FUD marketing. The Sarah Osbourne response is the \u201cD\u201d in FUD - doubt. It\u2019s written to cast doubt over the Linzhi post, and does so effectively. We have removed the intentionally deceptive Sarah Osbourne post from under our article. Trust Sarah Osbourne or trust Linzhi or trust neither of us and verify yourself. 5. Asymmetry of Proof and Verification Workloads p.10 \u201cit would change the amount of cycles required for verification\u201d The asymmetry in workload between proof and verification is a key attribute of PoW. The audit fails to show to which degree ProgPoW worsens the asymmetry, which impact this has on mobile clients and how one could model the impact of this on the decentralization of the network. 6. Programmatic and Programmable p.8 \u201cThe rationale of extending Ethash into a programmable PoW, by integrating a random math core\u201d ProgPoW is not \u201cprogrammable\u201d as in the typical meaning of that word among software developers. It cannot be programmable because it would then be unverifiable. A real programmable PoW would need to store the program along with the proof, and define a system of verifying that the program was executed in less time than the actual execution, similar to a zk-proof. ProgPoW adds a convoluted pseudo-random math logic to Ethash. ",

                    "content": "@chfast Apologies it took me a moment but I wanted to get permission from hyc and sech1 to quote them here. What do you think are the reasons for choosing int32 math? hyc and sech1 are key contributors to Monero\u2019s RandomX PoW algo, with deep knowledge around ASIC Resistance, or rather chip economics and performance. Both RandomX and the people behind it are highly recommended. The following is an excerpt from the #monero-pow channel on Freenode today:  < hyc > the fact that progpow only uses integer math leaves the door wide open for ASIC optimization. GPUs are loaded with floating point math units none of which would be needed in an eth/progpow ASIC IMO progpow will widen the gap btw ASICs and GPUs, with GPUs losing out   < sech1> yes, I have the same feeling. While with ETH you could underclock/undervolt GPU core and have most power used on memory, it\u2019s not the case with ProgPoW. ASIC could save on core power, but it\u2019s a smaller part of GPU power usage on ETH but it\u2019s different in ProgPoW and their reasoning for not using FP32 is just false RandomX has no problems with FP   < linzhi-sonia> hyc: sech1: do you mind if I post your statements (the last few lines) about progpow in an eth/progpow thread? (attributing to hyc and sech1)?   < sech1> I stand by my words yes, I think ProgPoW makes it worse What I would do with progpow is I\u2019d minimize computations (even less than in Ethash) while adding randomness and FP32 same size of mix state, same number of parallel lanes, but much less computations and FP32 instead of int would be perfect for progpow that would make ASIC chips bigger anyway but potential advantage smaller because GPU core would run at minimal clocks and voltage and then maximize amount of calculations for these clocks and voltage to still have >90% of memory bandwidth used so they kind of did everything right except they made progpow more power hungry should\u2019ve been the other way and not using FP32 is a big mistake even with existing progpow, simply tweaking parameters until it\u2019s less power hungry than ETHash will reduce ASIC advantage for real, by all metrics yeah, now that I think of it more progpow team did everything right except for not using the most efficient GPU clock/voltage when tweaking parameters they probably ran everything at stock which is stupid if you ask any miner   < hyc> linzhi-sonia: sure, fine to quote me. this is a public channel  ",
