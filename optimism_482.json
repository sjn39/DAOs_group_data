(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): Praise is an open-source comprehensive community intelligence tool. Praise is designed to be a reputation and rewards system in order to help communities create a more engaging online environment.Praise allows community members to acknowledge each other\u2019s contributions and practice gratitude by \u201cpraising\u201d peers. This bottom-up approach values peer recognition, keeping the community engaged and invested while promoting a more positive and productive online community. Praise gives active builders more influence and power within the organization, which is an important consideration in building a strong and sustainable community. The Praise system is user-generated data, trustworthy, and ungameable.Praise will help not only benefit optimism but the broader web3 ecosystem to acknowledge who is doing what and create different features to use this information which we call community intelligence. * Reputation token minter, could potentially be integrated for governance  * AI integration to know your community better (Ask me anything) * 1 click Self-deployment * Upgrade reports exports and analytics (community health, contributions etc.) * NFT reputation badge minter * Praise decentralization by using Ceramic Website: https://givepraise.xyz/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/givepraise Discord/Discourse/Community: General Magic Other relevant links (including any demos): Reward Systems: The Heart of DAOs - Livia DeschermayerPraise How-to: Quantifying Praise Additional team member info (please link): Praise is a project built by General Magic with a lot of support from rockstar DAO OGs. @kristoferlund is the project lead with design by @markoprljic, development by @nebsaas, @Vyvy_viM, @mhmdksh and @thegrifft as the product owner. @anamarie_com, @AAbugosh, @ZeptimusQ, and Giveth, Commons Stack and the Token Engineering Commons are all supporting the effort as well. Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: Aragon1hiveGnosisCommons StackToken Engineering CommonsENS Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): Praise has been trialed and tested in communities such as; the Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack, Giveth, Gnosis, Shapeshift, BrightID, Dappnode with few more organizations in the process of launching their Praise deployment. Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): https://coordinape.com/GitHub - sourcecred/sourcecred: a social algorithm for computing cred Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: No Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 5/31/2024 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: ProblemThe problem we are facing today in DAOs are:* Community engagement, so often we reach out on those Discord servers and if there is not someone with a specific role to answer you, rarely someone outside the core team engages. There is no incentives to someone that knows the answer to reply* Community intelligence, as an ecosystem we need a comprehensive, transparent and verifiable system for gathering and analyzing data about community contributions and engagement. In Web3 and DAOs, it is often difficult to get a clear picture of who is contributing to the community, what they are contributing, and how their contributions are impacting the community as a whole.* Reputation system, currently, many DAOs are governed primarily by financial power, which can be suitable for some types of organizations, but may not be the best fit for others. In particular, DAOs that aim to acknowledge expertise and contributions together with financial investment could benefit greatly from implementing a reputation-based governance system.* Culture of cooperation and gratitude, leading to a lack of motivation and bonding among contributors* Reward system as it is now relies on token holders\u2019 financial power to govern the organization. This can lead to a lack of incentives for non-token holders to contribute to the organization. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: Praise is a comprehensive community intelligence, reputation and rewards system designed to help communities create a more engaging online environment.Praise allows community members to acknowledge each other\u2019s contributions and practice gratitude by praising peers. This bottom-up approach values peer recognition, keeping the community engaged and invested, while promoting a more positive and productive online community. Praise gives active builders more influence and power within the organization, which is an important consideration in building a strong and sustainable community. The Praise system is user-generated data, trustworthy, and un-gameable. 434x541414\u00d7178 37.1 KB Embracing a gratitude culture and gathering decentralized updates on what is happening is a key resource to keep the community informed and take action on the issues that matter. We are dedicated to providing data-driven insights that help communities make informed decisions and create positive change.Praise is a working open-source product created by the Commons stack and developed by General Magic and it\u2019s being used in multiple communities such as Token Engineering Commons, Giveth, Gnosis just to name a few.Besides its communal benefits, communities also:* Use Praise for insights. Praise creates into how your community functions . Praise provides different types of data analysis and reports. We call it community intelligence.* Use Praise to reward contributors. Contributors are rewarded based on actual contributions and impact. Praise allows contributors to reward peers for their participation and loyalty with tokens, points, badges, or other virtual rewards. Praise integrates with a variety of token distribution platforms. This system can help organizations create better user experiences, increase user engagement, and foster a more supportive community.* Use Praise to build a culture of cooperation, giving and gratitude. Praise is a powerful tool that can help build strong communities, foster cooperation, and mutual support among members. By allowing community members to easily give Praise to other peers for their contributions;a positive feedback loop is created that motivates people to continue performing well and contributing to the community.Praise \u2192 Learn \u2192 Score \u2192 RewardNext steps, to unlock the full potential of Praise with Our Roadmap for Spring '23! Discover the Exciting New Use Cases That Will Revolutionize the Web3 Ecosystem.* Use Praise to build reputation scores. Praise provides a transparent and verifiable record of community contributions.Praise has a built-in feature that allows the creation of reputation scores which can be used to reward contributors for their efforts. Reputation could be used as a governance tool, without financial power ensuring builders get to communicate ideas, since reputation can not be sold in the market. This feature is easy to use, even if you don\u2019t have any prior experience with Web3 technologies. Praise will also support more advanced use cases, such as creating POAPs, NFTs or verifiable credentials that can be used to securely store and share information about an individual\u2019s qualifications, achievements, skills, and other attributes.* Use Praise for insights. The next phase of Praise will incorporate artificial intelligence, allowing it to analyze and share the data it collects with users who initiate a request through the Praise bot. This will provide valuable insights into the community\u2019s activities and the values each individual contributes. A dynamic organizational chart, updated in real-time with every Praise, will be easily accessible. The implementation of AI will be preceded by user research to identify the most important use cases and testing and fine-tuning of the request prompt.Praise self-deployment in 1 click. Our goal is to make Praise accessible to everyone, not just developers. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to announce the latest version, featuring a one-click self-installation process. Make the most of Praise\u2019s open-source capabilities and start experiencing its benefits today with ease and simplicity. Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: If Praise is integrated into the Optimism ecosystem, it will increase engagement and productivity within the community by recognizing and rewarding contributions. The implementation of a comprehensive community intelligence, reputation, and rewards system through Praise can also foster a culture of cooperation, gratitude, and growth. Additionally, the integration of AI capabilities and data analysis can provide valuable insights into the community\u2019s activities and help guide decision-making, contributing to the growth of the Optimism ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 173,000.00 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives?
