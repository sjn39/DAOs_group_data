                    "content": "Hello everyone, just a few technical clarifications for the Gelato network setup as it was not explicit enough in the MIP poll. As per this successful governance poll, a vest of 6 months for 1,000 DAI / day will be opened to the Gelato network for performing non-essential keeper duties under a trial period. Gelato has smart contract enforcement of only pulling at most 4,000 DAI at a time and returning any excess to the surplus buffer. Gelato network will be enforcing that keepers do not trigger this vest unless the Gelato treasury drops below 16,000 DAI and the claimable amount in the vest is larger than 4,000 DAI. A Gelato-controlled EOA is in control of the treasury funds during this trial period, but they should never have access to more than 20,000 DAI at a time. Protocol Engineering and Tech-Ops will monitor the progress of the trial and alert governance in the unlikely event of misuse. As we get more data and see that things are running smoothly we can move to the more long-term version of this setup which involves handing over full control to governance. ",
