Paragraph Summary This initial budget, for 163,200 Dai, provides five months of runway, August 2021 - Dec 2021. In the next year, we intend to submit bi-annual budgets, covering 6 months at a time unless otherwise prefered by MakerDAO. The annual budget figure is $486,000. A vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to:  An initial five month (Q3-Q4) budget. A continuous monthly funding model. A 3-month runway reserve, held in a protocol-owned multi-sig. An MKR vesting package for COM-001, with details being determined in the near future.   Specification  Motivation Remuneration for the Governance Communications Core Unit  Core Unit Name Name: Governance Communications ID: COM-001  Budget Implementation  Smart Contract Implementation Governance Communications Operational multi-sig: 0x1eE3ECa7aEF17D1e74eD7C447CcBA61aC76aDbA9  Implementation: Initial distribution to the Core Unit multi-sig will be manual until an automated solution is in place. Ownership: This multi-sig will be 1 of 1 initially, with additional signers being added as needed. Frequency: Protocol distributions to the multi-sig will occur during the last week of the month with all the other budget disbursements.  Governance Communications Continuous Operation multi-sig: 0x99E1696A680c0D9f426Be20400E468089E7FDB0f  Implementation: This multi-sig will be funded in full upon successful onboarding of the Governance Communications Core Unit. Access: In order for funds to be accessed from this multi-sig, the Maker protocol must be in a state where it is unable to pay team salaries due to protocol error, shutdown and/or under governance attack. Ownership: The Continuous Operation multi-sig will require 3 of 6 signatures from the following keyholders. This may be expanded to other critical Core Units as they are formed:  DavidUtro (COM-001): 0xE91f4F5834bB9312A45B2bd75804b32CC3DA8fd3 LongForWisdom (GOV-001) : 0x66f40F044E0e2F77bB746e3275E82e88dCBA2D69 Primoz (RISK-001): 0x5d67d5B1fC7EF4bfF31967bE2D2d7b9323c1521c SebVentures (RWF-001): 0x0D61C8b6CA9669A36F351De3AE335e9689dd9C5b Brian McMichael (PE-001): 0xC0dE1AB51082442f821bA273273B4F7d32521D8b Nik Kunkel (ORA-001): 0xB4CFf22c0d5a015460Fd503a9328Bf00a24f686c  Continuous Operation To ensure 3 months of continuous operation in the event of emergency shutdown or protocol issues, we will be requesting an upfront lump-sum of 3 months of runway to sit in a protocol owned multi-sig. Calculation: Use initial annual budget figure divided by 4 to determine the 3-month runway sum: 121,500 DAI Detail:  The lump-sum will be held outside of the surplus buffer in a protocol owned multi-sig. If normal protocol operation is not possible due to emergency shutdown or other protocol failure, these funds will be used to ensure continuous operation as the system gets back up and running. At the conclusion of the year, the lump sum will remain in the multi-sig for the following year and may be increased or decreased at that point in time due to changes in the projected budget.   Monthly Budget Statement Within the first 7 days of each month, COM-001 will submit Monthly Budget Statements with the following sections:   The Budget Forecast, based on the latest available information, of the budget (in DAI) that is required to maintain a 3-month runway for the team.  The Last Month Actuals, i.e. the actual expenses (DAI and MKR) of the month that just ended, this includes reporting any surplus or deficit.  The MKR Vesting Overview, this is a schedule that has the expected MKR vesting amounts for the current team configuration, grouped by the pay-out month.  Transaction Amounts, The required DAI amount to replenish the 3-month runway.  The Monthly Budget Statements will be added to the team drive. They will also be posted in this git repository on Github.  Budget Breakdown Please Note, Q3 2021 only covers the month of August, and includes some upfront costs. This budget assumes a July 2021 Governance Cycle ratification with August being our first month officially operating.     Description Annual Q3 2021 Q4 2021     Salaries (3 positions) $ 280,000.00 $ 23,333.33 $ 70,000.00   Hourly Compensation $ 40,000.00 $ 3,333.33 $ 10,000.00   Healthcare $ 43,200.00 $ 3,600.00 $ 10,800.00   Sign-on Expenses $ 1,800.00 $ 1,800.00 $ -   Travel & Events $ 10,000.00 $ 833.33 $ 2,500.00   Operating Expenses $ 11,000.00 $ 916.67 $ 2,750.00   Professional Services $ 50,000.00 $ 4,166.67 $ 12,500.00   Contingency Buffer $ 50,000.00 $ 4,166.67 $ 12,500.00         Total $ 486,000.00 $ 42,150.00 $ 121,050.00   Approximate Per month $ 40,500.00       Details Providing additional detail with regards to the above line items; Salaries: The current team has 1 full-time Facilitator and 1 full-time Project Manager, with the intention of hiring a second full time Project Manager within the first two months of operating. Hourly Compensation: The team also consists of multiple part-time contributors, who will be compensated on an hourly basis. These are roles that require less than 25hrs per week. Healthcare: In order to align with traditional company offerings, this proposal includes a healthcare supplement averaging $1250 p/month for full-time employees. Sign-on Expenses: Provided at the discretion of the Facilitator to attract top talent to the team. This will cover Opolis setup costs for full-time team members. Travel & Events: Team members may travel to present at industry events, participate in team or larger MakerDAO offsites. Operating Expenses: Coverage for managing general operational overhead; includes transaction gas costs, software subscriptions, and other miscellaneous costs. Professional Services: Payroll and accounting costs, as well as potential legal services if needed. Contingency Buffer: Approximately 10% of budgeted costs in the event that we underestimated our current budget. Unincluded items that may end up being an expense are covered by the Contingency Buffer and will be added to an updated budget in the future, if such items exist.  MKR Vesting The Governance Communications Team will add some version of MKR vesting for its team members, retroactively dated to the first day of their employment. Instead of offering our own unique proposal now, we will wait for the community to come to consensus around how Core Units should set this up. We support the formation of an overarching MKR Vesting framework that all Core Units can follow. ",

However\u2026 I hate to be always be that guy\u2026 It\u2019s painful for me, it would be much easier to say \u201cYEAHHH let\u2019s goooo\u201d. But I think, just MY OPINION, that the requested salaries are too high. The reasons imho are:  The salary level you ask is, outside of NY and San Francisco, very high. E.g., in Europe: Paris, Milan, Berlin etc. Again, talking about med-care: $1250 p/month might be standard in the US. But for example a professional in Europe will pay a fraction (an order of magnitude lower) than that. You have done a nice job, with passion in the past. But I don\u2019t have the impression that you are a PRO in the area of communication (including previous experience in companies, a proven track record of results, etc). Or at least it is my impression that the outcomes of your work have been not PRO level (but good for an enthusiastic community member). In any case, the PRO-level does not emerge from the \u201cTeam Credentials\u201d in here  Regardless of (2) above, unlike other types of tasks (Smart Contracts, Oracles, etc), which are very specific, require unique skills and are hard to find in a bull market, I suspect that communications is space where it\u2019s much easier to hire PROs from all around the world (since MakerDAO does not require workers to be in any specific zone).

But for example a professional in Europe will pay a fraction (an order of magnitude lower) than that.   Where I live in the EU, a monthly $ 1,250 more than the average net salary, but I\u2019m aware that even with that, we\u2019re in the global top 1/3 in terms of living standards. Dealing with tensions arising from differencies and inequalities around the world is a huge challenge within any open worldwide organization - here is not possible to hide contracts in the depths of a safe, as they do in centralized organizations I think it is important to emphasize that this is not a unique debate, it points to much more. In addition to salaries - there is -and will be-, a lot of tension (social, worldview, etc.) that is at least as important to deal with well as not to make a mistake in the code. The question is who and how will deal with this here? (Sorry if this problem has been suggested before and its escaped from my attention.) Going back to that nice football example from Doo. It\u2019s commonplace, but if you want to play in the Premier League, you need top players with top payouts. Is Ronaldo playing football better than a substitute in the top league? \u2026 well, I don\u2019t think so. But everyone wants to see him on the field because they trust him to lead the team to win. I can\u2019t decide who is worth Ronaldo\u2019s money for the team, but I hope there are more knowledgeable people here, who better understand the needs of the organization and know a good answer.

If we compare the Communications Facilitator to an Investor Relations Director for a PLC\u2013the average IR Director salary in the United States is $176,000 - I think David will be underpaid, TBH. With regards to David not being a seasoned \u201cPRO\u201d I disagree. I think David has improved his skill set since 2018, has weathered the storm, has built self-confidence, has no fear with communicating, has the ability to work under pressure, has outstanding people skills, and will represent the Maker vision and mission properly. And then we take Tim Black. I mean come on. We are so lucky to have Tim. Enough said. A few years back a successful investor told me to \u201cnever think with your own pockets.\u201d Meaning that you should always think BIG. Never let the price tag of something you believe in stop you from achieving greatness. Yes, in some parts of the world these salaries are high. But in some parts, they are inexpensive. If you think about the Communication Team members\u2013we are getting a bunch of extremely Talented people for what is considered fair wages in the United States. These individuals are David Utrobin, Ms. Anna Kryukova, Tim Black, Payton Rose, and Jerry Goldfarb. It is a bargain deal that the Maker Community needs to enroll. Let\u2019s get these folks on to an Executive Vote and set our Governance Communicate Team in stone. ",

I\u2019m not sure if I agree with this. At the end of the day, it\u2019s the value that you provide (and how easy you are to replace). If someone told you that they\u2019re going to hire 100 offshore workers to do the same task than a script written by a top developer, which one you would choose? The \u201ccheap per headcount\u201d salary? Or the expensive developer? It\u2019s about the value (and the quality).  Before we start discussing \u201csalaries\u201d, I want to discuss value. I\u2019ve already left a comment on the Mandate Subproposal. Right now, I do not see clarity in the Mandate, and it seems that we will be paying 27k Dai per month for Governance and Risk calls summaries.     flipflopflapdelegate:  I think David will be underpaid, TBH.       purrfection:  I can\u2019t decide who is worth Ronaldo\u2019s money for the team   Just to keep the analogy: if you hire Ronaldo to play in the NBA, he might have a hard time producing value (even if he jumps higher).

The Facilitator salary of 110k and PM salary of 75k are mid-range salaries. They were reasonable to all of the individuals I consulted. I made sure not to give our team too much credit out of the gate financially, but enough to make us a fair offer.   You are right, I am not at the top of the range of communications professionals, but I am a communications professional, a good operator, and the right person to start this team. Feel free to look over my credentials and commitment as a Facilitator.   Being effective in a communications role at MakerDAO also requires a good amount of background knowledge about the protocol. Of course, it is harder to find Smart Contract Engineers than communication professionals, but even they need to be the right fit.   All in all, we are launching with a team that is capable, qualified, fairly paid, and ready to serve MakerDAO. Nevertheless, we are interested in top-tier talent, so if you do know any communication PROs who you think would be interested in what we\u2019re doing, don\u2019t hesitate to introduce me! ",

Includes collecting and discerning key performance data, developing key messages, writing of earnings release and earnings call scripts and presentations, as well as preparation of senior management for investor Q&A. \u2022 Establishing and maintaining strong relationships with analysts, investors and prospective investors. This includes timely, consistent communications through telephone and personal contacts, group meetings, written materials and making presentations at one-on-one investor and analyst meetings and investment conferences. \u2022 Monitoring and communicating peer company performance, metrics and messaging. \u2022 Monitoring analyst models and street consensus to value/evaluate the company\u2019s performance, and providing advice and counsel with regard to key valuation drivers. \u2022 Developing and maintaining a compelling strategic investor roadmap inclusive of target shareholder analytics and outreach plan, as well as quarterly analysis of shareholder ownership changes, and acknowledging potential risks of activist and short activity within our shareholder base. These are quite different than David\u2019s proposed responsibilities. I think governance needs to consider the Global market rates for the salaried roles outside of the Smart Contract Core Unit (as the skillset is highly concentrated geographically relative to other functions). For example, what if we hired another full-time facilitator and project manager with equivalent responsibilities but they lived in a low cost of living area like Montana. Will they be paid the same rate and if not, how would they feel about having their compensation adjusted to reflect the lower cost of living? ",

And then the DAO uses that to pay all the teams, take it or leave it, and if they leave it we are prepared to hire outside folks. Bc if each team comes in and wants big bucks it could leave the project in a sorry state. The Makerdao needs to play some moneyball not yoloball. The first team that should prob be hired should be a restructuring team tbh. ",

Following this line of reasoning, a very enthusiastic 13yo with Metamask+Uniswap+Farming+NFT experience deserves a higher salary than a fancy pants CFA?     those are some clever 13-years old. Most Teens here have never heard, or could care less about DeFi. Most of them are trying just to enjoy life during the pandemic. But maybe you\u2019re right and there are some 13-years old front-running me. My point is\u2013there are tons of successful people in the world that don\u2019t have a College Degree, or a \u201ccertification\u201d who are successful, and a lot of folks with College Degrees and Certified who are struggling. So, ya\u2013that is my logic.     iammeeoh:  These people should be able to enjoy weekends (why not? Just take turns with others) and be potentially be faint of heart (how being faint of heart or not has anything to do with Governance communications?)   Sadly to climb Mount Everest, you can\u2019t have a faint heart. Climbing the DeFi mountain is going to take more than just getting DAI to $7B TVL. The competition is here my friend.

Examples include:  there are tons of smokers who reach their 90s, and many non-smokers who die young \u2192 true, but statistically smokers have lower life expectation. Yeah, I know several people who didn\u2019t have vaccinations as children, and they are stronger and more healthy than many other vaccinated people I know! \u2192 true, but statistically not having a vaccine is a terrible idea.  In other words, we should not take \u201csome examples\u201d as proof, but look at statistics.     flipflopflapdelegate:  successful people in the world that don\u2019t have a College Degree, or a \u201ccertification\u201d who are successful,   These people compensated their lack of education with something else: e.g., quitting early their studies to start a company. Go work early to gain financial freedom early and do something with it. Etc. In summary: I agree we should definetely consider people with unorthodox CVs, but that CV should be brilliant nonetheless.

I think working for a core unit can be compared to working as a contractor at this moment. There is quite a lot of job insecurity:  Governance can vote you out every quarter, or decrease funding There could be a grand DeFi hack/bug There could be an even grander Ethereum hack/bug Regulatory risks  As a contractor it is often advised to make sure you are earning enough in 8 months for a full year, to cover these uncertainties. Of course these risks could & should be mitigated as much as possible, but definitely taken into account. Furthermore, in countries like the Netherlands it is difficult to get a mortgage/refinance as a contractor (Damn CeFi!). I think most banks would regard working for a core unit the same, and therefore this also should be taken into account when talking salaries in my opinion. ",
