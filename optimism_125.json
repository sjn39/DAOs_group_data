                    "content": "UPDATE: Optimism Foundation has provided an important update for the next steps of governance, with an approach similar to that proposed in this proposal but with a broader scope for the next iteration. We\u2019ll move on to this soon.  Author Name: @Defi_LATAM_axlvaz @NicoEsp @SEED_LATAM_Joxes (DeFi Latam & Optimism Espa\u00f1ol [non-official]) Summary The idea of this proposal is to improve the voting process step by step, and to align more and more the community, delegates and protocols with the vision of Optimism. If this process has good results, it can be repeated every several cycles to continuously improve until we have an optimal system for all parties. This proposal intends to let cycle #2 finish and then establish a discussion period to improve the governance process related to Phase 1 before continuing with next cycles. In these terms, we can discuss timing and procedures or come up with another proposal that tries to improve the phased voting processes. Our ideas, formally below. Introduction Phase 0 has ended and Phase 1 is about to come to an end. Approximately 50 days have passed since the proposals for the different protocols in this governance were initiated. During this period of time 55 proposals have been analyzed and corrected, 25 from Phase 0 and 30 from Phase 1, which demands a great deal of time for the participants and delegates of this governance. During this process we have surely all (@OPUser) thought about how to improve the process for the next phase and better filter the proposals from the assigned protocols.Even this kind of topics are discussed in the discord channel, check out @linda\u2019s comment. Surely some of you must have been exhausted after spending hours analyzing each proposal and debating them in this forum. A pause for phase 1 From the DeFi Latam community and OptimismESP we propose to pause the voting process to make an analysis of Phases 0 and 1 among all the delegate representatives, and after that propose the necessary changes to improve the following voting. Objectives:  To enable delegates and token holders to improve the phase 1 process. Increase order and efficiency among the different actors: proposers, delegates and community. Increase the number of proposals encouraged on quality and not just quantity, allowing governance to accumulate experience and adjust development times accordingly.  Development:   Once Phase 1 cycle #2 has been voted and finalized. Stop the following voting cycles.   Within 15 days the delegates or any collaborator together with the community, has the possibility to submit to the forum a [DRAFT] with a maximum of 5 detailed and justified changes with the proposed improvements for the following votes.   Debate each [DRAFT] in the forum and pass to [READY] the proposals with the approval of at least 3 delegates randomly chose. Deadline 3 days.   Vote in Snapshot the [READY] proposals, in this case the voting time should be much shorter, we believe that with 1 week to vote these proposals is fine.   Apply the rule changes for the next Voting Cycle.   If this process is successful, apply it every 2 Voting Cycles until it is no longer necessary to propose changes.   Clarifications and recommendations:  Changes can be less than 5 but cannot exceed this amount. This is to be concise and more precise in the proposals. The changes have to be applicable in the next round of voting so they have to be simple changes and not so radical (these should have another treatment). Examples of changes: have a quota of maximum 20 protocols per phase, put a ceiling of OP token to the grants (maximum 5M), that the protocols that have to approve the proposal previously in their governance have it approved in their governance to avoid changes in case the Optimism governance approves them, etc. Surely some delegates or collaborators would have or share the same ideas during this process. It would be a good practice to combine one or more similar proposals so that when we get to the Snapshot there are not so many similar proposals. In case there are two or more opposing modification proposals on the same topic, we can move to contrast them in a new instance in the forum (new post for example) to finalize the discussion. We hope that delegates will collaborate in improving the draft proposals and reduce the work through decision via Snapshot.  We hope that our proposal will bring a positive discussion with new ideas and feedback in order to improve the governance process related to Phase 1 and leaving a precedent for future implementations. Stay Optimistic. ",

If so, I think your suggested process will force proposers to amalgamate their different proposed changes into a single vote. This may weigh down the most popular changes with others that are less favourable or less well understood, or shoot down strong ideas because of what they\u2019re bundled with. You may also end up with significant overlap, where two proposals take different and incompatible views on the same topic, but both are voted through. An approach I prefer would be to limit the proposals to one per topic, with multiple individuals feeding into each proposal\u2019s approach and available options (and being involved with multiple proposals). This would require some more stewardship in readying the proposals for voting, but would lead to much clearer and fairer decision-making on the changes, and less potential for conflicting or irrational outcomes.

I still haven\u2019t finished evaluating and voting on all of the Phase 1 proposals, and by the time I do there will likely be very little time for discussion/comment on the next round\u2019s proposals before they are locked into the next voting cycle. A brief pause in the cycle to get caught up, would meant that by the time the next batch of proposals go to vote most delegates have already had a good look at the protocols and had time to discuss thoughts with the proposers etc. Then we could quickly vote and use the time while phase 2 is on Snapshot to focus on the phase 3 proposals, so when they come to vote we are already familiar with them and can be reading though phase 4 etc etc. Looking back, this could have been how it was working from the start, and for some delegates I\u2019m sure this is how they are operating, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one working about 1/2 a cycle behind. I don\u2019t know if anything about the overall process would need to be changed to be honest, in my opinion just a reset to get us all to the same point, so we have done some digging into the next phase\u2019s proposals before they go live, would probably be enough, now that we can all see how the cycles flow.

The idea of the pause is only to order and have a clear communication between all participants whether they are proponents, delegates or participants.   Now I understood the reason for pause, I do agree with you on this one. Submitting proposal in Phase 1 does not make sense anymore, OP team should give them guidance to either change the pending/draft proposal to change them as Phase 2 or put them into different bucket. Also, yet to putting feedback at once place. ",

Here my response about some of your feedbacks      millie:  Isn\u2019t it highly likely this would create a too-many-chefs-in-the-kitchen situation where we\u2019ll end up debating back and forth for weeks on how to proceed   Yes we\u2019re thinking about it (risk of infinite loops) but I believe we\u2019re in a early stage to improve quickly various aspects and we as delegates have had enough coincidence. By example the objective of Phase 1 must be preserved, and the Optimism Foundation can help moderate the discussions quickly.     MinimalGravitas:  Then we could quickly vote and use the time while phase 2 is on Snapshot to focus on the phase 3 proposals, so when they come to vote we are already familiar with them and can be reading though phase 4 etc etc       OPUser:  the pending/draft proposal to change them as Phase 2 or put them into different bucket.   Just a little clarification, take into account that there is no Phase 2/3/4, Phase 1 will be extended until the funds are exhausted (196,128,233 OP) according to its docs. That\u2019s why we propose to anticipate in order to smoothly reorganize different points sooner rather than later. I expect that the Optimism Foundation will also propose some changes but surely if we start this discussion early we can provide a really positive improvement by establishing a formal timeframe for it first. Also, good to know that the team received our feedback and implemented an improvement in the Phase 1 templates (@bobby confirmation here) proposed by DeFi LATAM in this post; surely we can do more positive things.
