Due to the nature of crypto, I tend to lean towards pull notifications rather than push notifications. I don\u2019t currently have plans to provide Governance at a Glance as an emailed newsletter, and this is unlikely to change in the future. Fortunately, discourse supports RSS out of the box. Some email clients can follow RSS feeds directly, but there are also numerous specific RSS apps for consuming feeds on both desktop and mobile. These are a quick google away. Any URL in discourse can be made into an RSS feed by adding \u2018.rss\u2019 to the end of the URL. This includes pages for posts, categories and tags. I\u2019ve included some examples below.  An RSS feed that will notify you anytime a new thread is created with the signaling tag: The Maker Forum - Topics tagged signaling  An RSS feed that will notify you anytime I bump Governance at a Glance (I bump it weekly when I edit it): Governance at a glance - Old  An RSS feed that will notify you anytime anything is posted in the Governance category: Governance - The Maker Forum  If anyone has any other thoughts about how to setup notifications for forum or on-chain activity, please feel free to discuss them here. I feel like there may be some mileage to setting up Zapier or IFFFT recipes for notifications. Specifically, Zapier has this: https://zapier.com/app-directory/dagger-for-ethereum/integrations Which I believe lets you respond to on-chain events. This could be used to setup push notifications to email (or whatever) when a new poll or executive vote is created on-chain. Note that Zapier requires free registration. ",
