                    "content": "One of the main focuses of Season 3 is creating more accountability for grant recipients and transparency into how grants are actually being deployed. Delegates have begun taking steps towards providing this oversight in the #gov-monitoring channel and on the Forum. The Foundation would like to support these efforts by suggesting standardized reporting requirements for grant recipients. Those submitting proposals would be responsible for providing the below data in an easy to input format. This data would be publicly accessible and usable by the community. This process is easily adaptable, so it can be managed by the Grants Council, if the Council passes in S3, or any alternative structure that prevails if the Council does not pass. Grant recipients would need to agree to these reporting requirements in the grant application template (which would be updated to reflect this). There are two obvious opportunities to collect this data from grant recipients: when the Foundation collects KYC info at time of grant approval and when milestone-based grant distributions are evaluated. On an ongoing basis, proposers are incentivized to provide updates as delegates may actively monitor this data, which will be accessible via a public dashboard. We\u2019d like to get delegate feedback on the below suggested reporting requirements. The goal is to create a set of reporting requirements that results in consistently structured and easy to ingest disclosures without creating a level of friction that deters projects from building on Optimism.  Proposed Reporting Fields  Our goal is to collect all information in a way that:  Any delegate/analyst can accurately track grant distributions Governance can effectively evaluate growth experiments and continue to iterate Requirements are thorough but lightweight enough to avoid overburdening proposers  The following information may be entered by proposers in a Google Form. Results would be publicly viewable by anyone (and updatable by the Foundation or Grants Council, as applicable)  For Growth Experiment Grants  OP Incentive Distribution Schedule: Up-to-date schedule of OP planned, in-flight, and completed OP incentives. There should be one entry for each distinct distribution strategy (i.e. Row 1: retroactive airdrop, Row 2: liquidity mining on Pool A, Row 3: liquidity mining on Pool B).   Project Name: Name of project giving out OP  Affiliated Project (if applicable): Top-Level project that received OP (i.e. Thales <> Overtime, Gamma/Arrakis/xToken <> Uniswap)  Distributor contract address: What address(es) are tokens distributed from?  Announcement Date: Date a program was announced  Announcement Link: Link to program announcement and details  Start Date: Date a program started  End Date: Date a program ended  Distribution Type: i.e. Liquidity mining, Trading mining, Competition, Retroactive airdrop, Other (explain)  OP per Epoch: If a scheduled program, how much OP goes out per epoch (i.e. 500 OP)  Epoch Length: If a scheduled program, how long is the epoch (i.e. 1 week = 500 per week)  App Incentivized: Is usage incentivized on the native app, an external liquidity pool (i.e. DEX pool), something else?  Contract(s) Incentivized: What address(es) are incentivized (i.e. DEX Router, LP Pool)  Action(s), Pool(s), etc. Incentivized: What type of action is incentivized (i.e. NFT Purchases, stETH/ETH pool liquidity)  Eligible Addresses: Is this limited to a specific address list? If so, how many (i.e. retro airdrop) and/or what is the eligibility requirement (i.e. holders of a specific NFT)?  Extra Notes: Any other information that helps us accurately understand token distribution - Or an explanation if the program\u2019s structure does not fit this structure  OP Internal Transfer Record: List of internal transfers of a project\u2019s OP token grant (i.e. transferring tokens between wallets). This will provide visibility into which tokens have left the project\u2019s provided L2 address, but are not yet distributed.   Project Name: Name of project giving out OP  Affiliated Project (if applicable): Top-Level project that received OP (i.e. Thales for Overtime)  Transaction Hash: Transaction hash of the transfer  Sender Address: Address sending the OP (i.e. the project\u2019s wallet)  Recipient Address: Address receiving the OP (i.e. the project\u2019s wallet)  Recipient Address Name: What is the recipient address\u2019 purpose (i.e. entity name, address label)   For Builders Grants  Grant Program Distributions: List of grant payouts for projects who used their OP governance grant to run their own grants program. This helps us understand the impact of governance distributions to project grants programs (i.e. what super cool things came out of the grants programs?)   Project and Grant Name: Name of grant and project transferring OP  Affiliated Project (if applicable): Top-Level project that received OP (i.e. Thales for Overtime)  Transaction Hash: Transaction hash of the transfer  Sender Address: Address sending the OP (i.e. the project\u2019s wallet)  Recipient Address: Address receiving the OP (i.e. the project\u2019s wallet)  OP Transferred: Amount of OP Tokens Transferred  Recipient Address Name: What is the recipient address\u2019 purpose (i.e. entity name, address label)  Grantee Name: Name of the entity receiving the grant (could be generic, i.e. bug bounty, if relevant)  Grantee Website/Github/Twitter: Where can we keep up with the grantee\u2019s progress?  Grant Description: Information about the grant (i.e. purpose, milestones, grant program information)  ",

I think this is a great start, I think before enacting and enforcing it, we should call and discuss if there are any discrepancies or adjustments we\u2019d like to make before it goes to a vote, not after and we\u2019re having proposers scramble to find requested information.
