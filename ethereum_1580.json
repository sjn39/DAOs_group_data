I am thinking about forking Metamask and doing the minimum amount of changes in order to support the following:   For a particular key, the wallet will show the total tokens held on ALL chains. Then, in the detailed view mode the split will appear showing the subamount for every chain.   Moving token from one chain to another will be abstracted out. In particular, if you click  to use an app running on a particular chain, the required amount of tokens will automatically move to this chain.   Ideally there would be an open discovery process to discover new chains and interchain token transfers.   There will be no chain switching UI, for a particular key all chains will be immediately available.   Comments are welcome ) ",

In fact, to ensure that it works wonderfully, we\u2019ve done a ton of design work, user testing, and refactoring, to make sure that this is not just added, but allows existing applications to continue working while also providing a smooth path to multi-chain dapps. In the meanwhile, I hope you did notice our EIP-3085 methods for adding & switching chains for the user. They\u2019re made to help hold people over in the meanwhile. RPC API | MetaMask Docs ",
