Problem Space Changes This Subproposal removes the following items from the Problem Space:  Core Governance Framework Collateral Onboarding Decentralized Oracle Freeze Module Appeals Process Dai Stabilization Cycle Vote Delegation Synthetic Assets Oracles Emergency Oracles Dai Stability Adjustment Module Website and Social Media Guardian Entities and Reserves Vote Incentives Revisit Auction Design Dai Foundation It also deletes the \u201cimportant note\u201d to reduce clutter and confusion. This results in the deletion of all content between lines 82 and 103.  It adds the following items to the Problem Space, inserting them at line 82:   Constitution: The constitution is a MIP that contains the core tenets of the social contract and voter pre-agreements that stabilize the meta of the Endgame State  Endgame Product MIPs: A set of MIPs that define each Endgame Product in as much detail as possible. Only products that are already detailed and defined in the Endgame Products MIPs can be added to the Maker Protocol.  Scope MIPs: The Scope MIPs are individual MIPs that each cover the 11 Scopes that define all Maker Governance processes and the expectations and KPIs of the Decentralized Workforce.  Metanomics: The Metanomics MIP provides an immutable and unambiguous definition of what the long-run, unchangeable tokenomics of the Endgame State will be. This includes MKR emissions, Maker surplus funnelling, MetaDAO emissions, and MetaDAO surplus funnelling.  Launch MetaDAO Activation: To trigger the Endgame Plan Launch, a Launch MetaDAO Activation MIP is required, as this authorizes the deployment and activation of the MetaDAO tokens and the MetaDAO token farms.

The proposal aims to revive the core concept of MIP1, which was largely forgotten, and provide clarity around when Maker Governance starts to slow down and not invite so many proposals. The proposal removes several items from the problem space and adds new ones. The post is an explanation of the proposal, and it invites feedback and questions from third parties. Additionally, the post can be seen as advertising the proposal to the MakerDAO community. Some third parties provide constructive criticism of the proposal and ask questions about it.",

                    "content": " MIP1c4-SP1:  Subproposal for Changing the Problem Space This is a summary of the subproposal and its effects upon ratification from GovAlpha\u2019s perspective:  This is a valid MIP1c4 subproposal that alters the Governance Paradigm Problem Space in the context of the Endgame. The Governance Paradigms and derived or related concepts within the MIPs Framework have the twofold intent of modularizing sets of MIPs by scopes, which aims to make upgrading or otherwise altering sets of interrelated processes safer and easier while providing core goals for the DAO to achieve.  MIP1 has not seen much practical use either as a guiding star nor as an administrative tool. The author of the subproposal feels that the Endgame requires it to be revised, revived, and put to use. MIP1c4-SP1 replaces all current Problem Space items (of which most are arguably solved) with the following new ones:  Constitution Endgame Product MIPs Scope MIPs Metanomics Launch MetaDAO Activation   The ratification of this subproposal would signal consensus around the prioritization of bringing about the Endgame vision.
