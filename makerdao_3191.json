                    "content": "Investigation of liquidation bots on DyDx reveals that basically 100% of these bots have access to the off-chain prices published via the ScuttleButt network. An example of the traceback of such a bot is here:    bloxy.info    Tx  0x37de0bbafb511180cf246cf5d7685bc174d493311036463eb670f846ba2cf119      You\u2019ll notice the first thing each of these bots does is make a poke to the oracle with the new prices from ScuttleButt, to effect the liquidation. It\u2019s basically impossible to profitably run a liquidations bot without being the poster of the prices. After searching everywhere for how to get access to these prices I\u2019m left feeling confused. Some of the discussion here seems to indicate that you need to be providing some kind of community service to get access. However, it\u2019s easily observable on the blockchain that hundreds of bot operators already have access to these price feeds off-chain, and are using them daily to trade liquidations on various markets. Therefore, it is clearly unfair not to allow the public to access these prices, as the effect is to permission only select people to make millions of dollars in profit in a super centralised and sandboxed environment where no-one else is allowed to compete. If this is not the case, what is the process for getting access to these prices off-chain? There doesn\u2019t appear to be any public information clarifying this. Thanks! ",

                    "content": "I\u2019ve brought this suggestion up with them, their official response was:  I think from an entire protocol perspective the 20s delay is worse than the liquidator fairness problem it would solve. Adds a bit of risk to the whole protocol It\u2019s actually good for the protocol that now those submitting an oracle price have an incentive to do so earlier. Because they can immediately liquidate valuable accounts too Which would incentivise them to submit the maker prices on chain quicker  I don\u2019t follow that logic to be honest, but they seem highly resistant to dealing with the issue on their end. Which is extremely concerning as they themselves have access to the ScuttleButt network. As a general principle it should probably be a rule that any liquidation protocols who themselves have access to ScuttleButt be required to institute a delay in their own protocols like MakerDAO has, because otherwise there is no transparency as to whether they are running insider trading bots and liquidating their own users.
