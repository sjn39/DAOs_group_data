For added security, please sign a message with your wallet to continue.\u201d Have connected in the past with same wallet/pc and never received this message. Before signing the message, I just wanted to check if this is a legitimate message from Oasis? Thanks, ",

This is why the website does not recognize some previous users anymore, and in that case it asks to sign the Terms and Conditions again. As always, just double-check that you\u2019re connecting to the official site: https://oasis.app/borrow And check in the address bar of your browser that the connection is secure (SSL certificate.)  2021-05-22_123508687\u00d7512 99.5 KB  Also make sure you always have the latest versions of MetaMask, and your hardware wallet is up-to-date with the latest firmware (for example through Ledger Live.)
