In the call we would discuss previous governance polls, upcoming and current governance polls, proposal feedback and any relevant governance issues.  It would also be an opportunity for community members to connect and have open discussions.  I am happy to facilitate until someone else can take over.

I agree community call should be open but I am also skeptical that open call might lead this into something like twitch stream where we see more noise and filtering actual comment would be a difficult task.

By default only the delegates will be able to unmute & talk, but general community can raise their hands (very similar to zoom/hangouts) then we can unmute them. That way we still have community involvement but it does not get too noisy as @OPUser mentioned, which is a real concern.  @katie Date/Time: August 2nd 10am PT/1pm ET/7pm CET  This time works great for me, I am happy to sit quietly facilitating so you can focus on the content.

I\u2019m based on the east coast of Australia and the current meeting time is at 3am in the morning, which is neither a \u2018late night\u2019 nor an \u2018early morning\u2019. Being based in this time zone, I\u2019m used to odd hours to line up with overseas, but 3am is pretty hard to attend. 1am Sydney time or 5am Sydney time is far more appealing, i.e. a \u2018late night\u2019 or \u2018early morning\u2019 situation, but any shift would be greatly appreciated. What\u2019s everyone else\u2019s thoughts? Does the current time work for all of you? If there are others who find this time slot tricky, please speak up, as it may convince the community to shift the time. Thanks for your consideration. Kind regards, Axel ",
