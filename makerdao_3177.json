                    "content": "Hey guys  It\u2019s Andrey from Incognito. Previously I showed up with the ambition of Making DAI a default stable coin on Incognito pDEX. This time I would like to show you how we anonymized $3.5M DAI. There are a lot of discussions is going on around privacy and gas fee topics. I would like to share how we solved those two problems.  Let me pitch to you the wallet itself Incognito wallet allows you to store, transfer, trade, and invest DAI anonymously. By anonymously I mean:  Your wallet balance is encrypted (hidden) Your transaction history is encrypted (hidden) Sender & Receiver addresses are unlinked Your trading data is dissociated with your wallet address Your Liquidity Providing data is encrypted (hidden) *Network fee for a transaction \u2248 $0.00001 (possible to pay in DAI or PRV)  Here is how the wallet looks like:  image726\u00d71086 79.7 KB   And bring more light on technology stack behind Behind the application level, we developed Incognito protocol - layer2 privacy solution, with $2M DAI and $4.5M in ETH locked in the network. To achieve our goal of delivering cheap privacy we work towards 3 main directions:   Privacy: Ring Signature, Confidential Transactions, Stealth addresses \u2014>   Scalability: POS, Sharding \u2014>   Interoperability: Non-custodial bridging\u2014>    Why do I make this post  Firstly, we  DAI Incognito community decided that we should  bring more usage of DAI into Incognito ecosystem and make it a major stable coin of the network Currently on the Incognito network used only 2M DAI and we aim to scale this usage up to 10% of DAI supply. (Ambitious, right? We believe if crypto wins - privacy wins)   Your turn Could you please give us your opinion on several questions:  What do you think about the demand for privacy from DAI holders? Could Incognito be a solution that helps bring DAI into developing countries and/or remittance market (with close to zero TXs fee and full anonymity of transactions) ? Which project/ppl in the Maker ecosystem should we talk about our ideas?  ",

Thanks for the overview.   Privacy demand seems high in theory, low in practice. This is likely due to the regulatory uncertainty behind private crypto wallets and tools. Until there is more clarity there, I believe the usage will be substantially muted.   Sure, it can. In fact the biggest problem for smaller Dai users around the world today is inflated gas costs.

For example, things like travel rule is compliant with Incognito\u2019s privacy solution. With READONLY keys you are able to verify your DAI balance. DAI on Incognito is like cash in your pocket. You can simply report it for tax purpose, but ppl can see it only if you allow.     Davidutro:  Sure, it can. In fact, the biggest problem for smaller Dai users around the world today is inflated gas costs. L2s are crucial, and I think the next year or two will be all about finding the best L2 to achieve some form of retail tx volume scalability.   I think we are on the same understanding here.  At Incognito we try to solve it as well. On this moment  Incognito has 8 shards and able to proceed 100 TPS, but the current demand \u2248 5k daily TXs Average TX fee in the protocol is around $0.000001  @Davidutro would you recommend any particular niche we should focus on or just. test the ground around?     Davidutro:  Dai users. There are probably a good many of them here in this community. I suspect their questions will probably be around risk both with the wallet app itself and with the L2.   Yeah, hopefully, to get more feedback from users, to understand what should we improve in the application or protocol layer. Salty feedbacks are the most useful  ",

A quick example of how our life became simpler with privacy We have 43 members in the core team and before we implemented privacy payroll was a headache for our accountant. She used mixers, she used binance, she made transfers from different wallets.  no need to explain to anyone if you do payroll from one account all salaries are linkable, wallet balances and expenses are traceable to everyone in the team and outside.  With Incognito, she doesn\u2019t need to dance with a tambourine anymore. She executes the whole payroll from one address and does not worry about privacy.

Awesome thanks for this info, still ppl here like to see apps in spanish.     boogaav:  Also within next 2 weeks we plan to release a web extension, that might make privacy accessible without download mobile app. Also web extension would be easier to translate in different languages   And yes, this sounds nice as well, like having a Metamask with Incognito, maybe the keymaster thing and having three keys seems (to me) little bit confusing and make the onboard little bit hard for non-crypto (and even less experienced) users. Maybe just giving an initial ERC20 address (the anon one) and focusing on explaining the shield part would be better. I\u2019m still seeing how it works so will let you know anything that comes up !
