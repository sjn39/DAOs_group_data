I also wondered if it would be a good idea to poll people regarding their migration experience.  I assume all people participating in this have opened at least one CDP. Here is a example questionnaire.  Were you able to migrate your CDP successfully Y/N? If you migrated successfully how would you rate your experience in a 1-10 (10 easy, great fast, intuitive stress free, 5 I did it, but consumed a bit more time somewhat stressful, 1 horrible, took way too much time, not intuitive, stressful). If you have not migrated please check off the reasons. a)   lack of SAI liquidity  y/n b)   technical issues with wallet, website, browser, etc. y/n c)   can\u2019t pay the fees currently y/n d)   other (please list) Did the migration cause you concern or stress y/n Would you recommend to someone else to use Maker y/n If you answered no to 5)  did the migration experience cause you use other decentralized services? Do you still plan on owning or holding DAI? y/n  This is just an idea.   Feel free to comment or elaborate. I could not find a category for this (user feed back) so left it empty. ",
