Following a recent discussion on Reddit with @LongForWisdom I\u2019d like to express some concern over DAI\u2019s reliance on stablecoins to stay pegged and the long term vision for the PSM. Right now, DAI is super tight on the peg because of the PSM. This is great and the PSM achieved what it set out to do. But while I thought the PSM was a temporary measure, things appear to be going in a different direction with the latest increase of the debt ceiling exceeding the previous debt ceiling + USDC-A vault\u2019s debt ceiling. If it fills up, it seems that the governance response will simply be to increase the PSM ceiling, much like we do for other vaults. While it\u2019s not as bad as it was at one point, the significant amount of stablecoins used to establish DAI\u2019s peg is something I find troubling. Meanwhile, we\u2019re also increasing stability fees across the board although DAI is above $1. I believe there needs to be an effort to   Use the PSM as a last resort mechanism after interest rate based fixes cannot help. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to charge 5.5% to ETH-A vault owners and raise the USDC PSM ceiling because we expect demand for DAI to exceed supply. I am not sure I agree with the idea that leverage seekers are insensitive to the interest rate. During a bull market, the PSM should be emptying out, not filling up!   Have some long term plan to rely less on stablecoins. If this is the situation in a bull market, I can\u2019t imagine how we will survive the next bear market except by loading up the PSM with huge amounts of USDC to keep DAI pegged.   I realize I am criticizing without providing solutions (apart from a recommendation to lower stability fees) but I hope some ideas can come out of this. Thank you for reading! ",

In nominal value yes, but that share of stablecoins in collateral backing DAI decreased. Also keep in mind that even if we had 0 stablecoins in collateral, we would still want to have 20%+ of DAI debt minting capacity available from USDC or any stablecoin in order to prevent DAI liquidity squeeze in crash events or in events of DAI demand surge. Which means we\u2019ll always be exposed to stablecoins one way or another if you want to protect the peg in distressed market conditions or other short term demand and supply imbalances. Unless you diversify collateral to something less volatile (RWA being an example) or we find another solution in regards to peg management in distressed events.     AstronautThis:  It doesn\u2019t make sense to me to charge 5.5% to ETH-A vault owners and raise the USDC PSM ceiling because we expect demand for DAI to exceed supply.   I hear this a lot, but let me try to highlight a bit different angle to this. Is community ok by charging close to 0% fees on ETH-A where you have a 1.3bn exposure growing mad and knowing losses can amount to tens of millions in Black Thursday scenario? And don\u2019t forget to add other collaterals and potential losses. We made improvement with Surplus Buffer, but we are not there yet and very low fees wouldn\u2019t help much. I however expect Liquidations 2.0 implementation will allow Maker to offer lower rates since both liquidations risks and risk premiums will be reduced. We are also implementing lower SF ETH-C vaults for rate sensitive users. I am generally more worried about losses on crypto collateral than USDC blowing in short term, but I totally get your concerns. But in general it always comes down to this trade-off: stable peg = more stablecoin backing, volatile peg = less stablecoin backing. Also one major misunderstanding about Maker that I am observing is that centralized collateral is always seen as a curse although in reality Maker (or better, quality of DAI) in my view was always about increasing DAI network effects and meanwhile implementing proper risk management. Here is how I look at it: more USDC means stable DAI and stable DAI means more usage and more usage leads to more minting and fees from other collateral. And this is great because Surplus Buffer and MKR value grow and help to hedge against counterparty risk exposure from adding centralized assets that again increase usability and so on. Finally this also eventually decreases reliance on stablecoins since demand and supply shocks are minor relative to total DAI supply at one point. ",

But in general it always comes down to this trade-off: stable peg = more stablecoin backing, volatile peg = less stablecoin backing  Can I ask what is considered an acceptable deviation from the peg? 0.1%? 1%? This would be related, as you point out, to the stablecoin dependence. I always understood that DAI was meant to be a soft peg and that our users should not expect it to be as stable as, say, USDC. Is this still the community\u2019s understanding or have expectations changed? In any case, it would be good to know what range is considered reasonable.  even if we had 0 stablecoins in collateral, we would still want to have 20%+ of DAI debt minting capacity available from USDC or any stablecoin in order to prevent DAI liquidity squeeze in crash events or in events of DAI demand surge  This is related to the previous question but again, are we trying to change DAI from a soft peg to an almost always hard peg? Moreover, can I ask where the 20% comes from? In the future, it seems that as DAI supply grows, the supply shocks are better absorbed and hence this stablecoin backing should decrease in percentage terms. Is there a roadmap for DAI supply vs percentage dependence on USDC and other stablecoins? Even if it doesn\u2019t exist, do you think this might be worth having as a target? Also, the current PSM debt ceiling is 1B which is 40% of current DAI supply and even if we\u2019re not using it all, the fact that the ceiling is that high seems excessive. 28% of DAI is now backed by USDC (if I have read daistats correctly) and that\u2019s again well above 20%. I do see your side of this and a lot of it makes sense. But it seems that we are missing a clearer picture of the path out of stablecoin dependent DAI. It may all fix itself when we have enough diversified collateral but I fear that a conscious effort needs to also be made to prevent USDC and other stablecoins from becoming a crutch for DAI. ",
