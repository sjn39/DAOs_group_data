However, just for the sake of discussion, I wonder if we want this type of posts in the MakerDAO forum, considering that it is:  general crypto news with no (apparent?) direct link with MakerDAO. Although one could see Maker as margining trading platform, but that\u2019s a bit of a stretch. there are a lot  of other generic crypto news sources of infos (including the speculation channel in our chat) if there is a proliferation of these posts, the forum could be flooded by news unrelated to MakerDAO, and this would make it hard(er) to navigate.

In order to protect their currencies - it would be logical for countries to severely limit crypto trading - i.e.:  no privacy coins (done), no deposits from tornado/mixers (in progress?) deposits from whitelisted crypto addresses only withdrawals to whitelisted crypto addresses only limit the amount of crypto a person can trade in a year (Russia - done?) automatic deduction of taxes before fiat withdrawals no paying with crypto without KYC no loading of credit cards with crypto \u2026  ",
