I think it is good digital hygiene to use different dApps with different keys - especially as there is still a lot of privacy infrastructure missing on ethereum or it is just still to expensive to use. But UX wise this can be hard - 2 ideas to help here: when the dApp is querying for the account  add ability give a hint what account was used last save what account was used last with a certain dApp on the wallet side. I think for this we would need something like a dApp-id as the name might not be stable enough over time  ",

Some wallets might generate a new address per login per dapp. On the user side, email address and one time login link for length of session is the most usable way to access. No passwords. Up to user to generate multiple emails for multiple dapp identity. For malicious dapps this can still allow for correlation, but makes pure on chain correlation harder. I think we need some consistent flow diagrams to help talk about this. ",

OK - perhaps we need to define these terms to get some shared context - for me this would be:  account: keypair with possible metadata (name) wallet: contains account(s) address: identifier of account derived from the public key login: using an account to access something identity: don\u2019t want to define this term - don\u2019t even like to use it \u2026-)  ",

We definitely don\u2019t agree on all terminology  Thank you for the account / address disambiguation \u2014 I have struggled with that in the past. Additionally there is the concept of a dapp account \u2014 which MAY use an account to login or MAY use a completely separate kind of login. There is more than one kind of login to both dapps and wallet apps. eg every time I open The Status wallet & Chat app I need to enter a password. That is a login (perhaps native app login to differ from dapp login). Every time I open Trust Wallet on iOS I need to enter TouchID. That is technically an authentication \u2014 my \u201clogin\u201d of the wallet app is cached and tied to my mobile device.
