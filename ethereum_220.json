                    "content": " Should Core EIP uses a number or a placeholder when introducing Cross-posting some comments from this PR #6054 @axic says  You absolutely need to define some number otherwise nobody can implement and test it. It is also absolutely fine to resolve conflicts when things are accepted into a protocol upgrade. This has been the practice.  @xinbenlv responded  @axic the placeholder mark is meant to archive exactly what you mean here. When using a placeholder mark, implementers have to choose some number, and just like all parameters will be passed in, placeholder mark will also be passed in some number by implementer for sure. In addition to choosing some number, using placeholder highlights such number is subject to change, not only when finalized, but also during draft. because:\"  Having a placeholder name helps people search across different implementations, geth, ethereumjs with consistent parameter naming and make them configurable. This will be particularly useful say when they want to run cross-implementation consensus testing so a tester can config the placeholder to the same number and start testing.  We could avoid this case: different implementers who implemented EIP-663 before this PR may hardcode the 0xb0 but implementer after this PR may hardcode 0xb3 for DUPN, and didn\u2019t get reminded for paramatize DUPN as a placeholder for cross-platform testing.  and  Another benefit is that, if there is any implied mathematical relationship between multiple instructions introduced by an EIP, having placeholder marks for all of them kind of help reminding EIP Author to explain such relationship. For example, when I read `DUPN` (`0xb3`) `SWAPN ` (`0xb4`)  I interpret that it implies you are suggesting they are better to (1) be allocated starting with 0xb_ section, and are better to (2) be consecutive. But when I read `DUPN` (`0xb0`) `SWAPN ` (`0xb1`)  In addition to  (1), (2), there was also a possible interpretation (3) that this EIP Author wants to suggest putting DUPN and SWAPN to a new Hex-teen(0x10) sector. Such implied interpretation is now removed because of this PR#6054. Such mathematical relationship may affect when people want to design chips / physical circuits for EVMs in the future so I assume sometime authors may care.  ",
