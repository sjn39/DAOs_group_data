Maker looks good. Does anyone know Andreessen\u2019s GC and can we get them to delete their paper that\u2019s referenced in this letter? It\u2019s not constructive and probably inaccurate. Given my lawyer\u2019s analysis, I\u2019d only [MAYBE] be concerned about a DAO tax liability or U.S. taxable connection. Thanks!  2021-12-09 TRS Ltr1275\u00d71650 134 KB  ",

This line of analysis could ultimately result in a \u201clook-through\u201d to MKR holders which is an insane view. For example, I\u2019m not liable for Apple patent violations simply because I own APPL shares. I do think it would be helpful for Andreessen-a16z to recant or correct this odd paper. Thanks ",

Patent No. US 10,025,797 B1 describes a system so general, vague, and incomplete that their \u201cpatented system\u201d loosely describes smart contracts, off-chain oracle networks such as Chainlink, Merkel proofs, L2 scaling solutions, IPFS hashes, proof of history, and much more all at the same time, without going into any specifics. Definitely a patent troll.\"   Other points that have come up. They appear to be directing their arguments at Maker\u2019s Oracle Security Modules from a couple of years ago. Are they are too late to make a two or three year old claim? Still the Achilles heel for patent owners is finding the one company that is infringing. Best case here it is a Maker\u2019s codebase, which too bad for them, isn\u2019t that one company you would need to attach to. ",

If you shop around, you can find legal counsel who are both constructive on the fully decentralised nature of DAOs and their stateless nature. Here\u2019s a summary of their guidance. The best long run approach is not setting up a legal entity at all and to rely on a fully decentralized structure. DAOs without a registered legal entity can theoretically operate outside the law. In most jurisdictions, they may be seen as general partnerships, but without corresponding legal consequences. While there may be risk of the personal liability of every participant, because the DAO has no legal personality,  it can actually own assets and also employ people without risk of local law or regulation - consider it a shield. When participants do not legally register a DAO as an LLC or Company, they constructively avoid creating a fully recognized legal entity in most jurisdictions that can sue and can be sued. This is often misunderstood. Most DAO operators agree with these positions. ",
