Does the Risk Team monitor outflows to Exchanges? Also I was reading that the overall MKT was over leveraged since February\u2014was there a moment that we felt the same with regards to Maker in the last couple of months? I know most of the liquidations ( approximately 775,000 Traders) happened on centralized exchanges and Maker\u2019s participation was pretty small compared to All. But wondering if your team uses tools to monitor the centralized world. ",
