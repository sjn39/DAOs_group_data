By funding the moonshot collective, we\u2019re creating a cryptoeconomic force for builders in the space to create tools for GitcoinDAO and the ecosystem at large.\n\nDuring Q3, the collective received 40k GTC, which accomplished the following:\n\nThe launch of Moonshot Bots which generated $2.2mm for the Gitcoin Grants multisig.\n\nThe creation of Quadratic Diplomacy, a decentralized tool for distributed rewards to workstreams.\n\nThe creation of Tip.Party, a tool for rewarding engagement in the DAO.\n\nThe creation of a half dozen other tools for DAO-era Coordination.\n\nDo you approve our Q4 budget?",

Budget Request Request to send 127k GTC (138k mins remaining 10k GTC & 40k DAI from Q3) to the dGTC multisig to fund their Q4 2021 budget. Gnosis Safe address: 0x931896A8A9313F622a2AFCA76d1471B97955e551  Q3 Achievements & Budget Deployment In Q3 of 2021 the dGTC workstream utilized the budget granted to take the Decentralized Grants platform from a rough draft concept to working POC. We have kicked off a Grant Round for the Moonshot Collective team which contained 11 grants. Since the start of the round we have had 3 new grant submissions which have gone through the approval process and you can see on the platform at https://grants.gtcdao.net/ Out of the 41,300 GTC received for Q3, we have 10k GTC and 40k DAI remaining which we are moving forward to our Q4 budget. Reference previous budget here: Decentralize Gitcoin - Workstream Budget Request  Q4 Goals High Level During Q4 the Decentralize Gitcoin workstream will (and has already started to) continue to collect feedback and improve the user interface and user experience, build additional features based on what is most important to run the round in GR12 and for claiming payouts, start working on implementing active sybil resistance and basic curation, and kick off the DID/Sybil Score Aggregation project and DevOps/Data initiative.  Q4 Team Growth High Level In Q4 we will scale the team in order to meet the goals that we have outlined above (and in more detail in the detail breakdown). For the dGrants project team, we are adding two more full time developers focused on backend and blockchain to lessen our reliance upon outsourced development, a temporary marketing resource to assist with promoting the dGrants side round in GR12, and a temporary designer to level up the dGrants experience. We will bring on a Project Manager as a shared resource across all dGTC projects who will also be responsible for community relations. For the DID and DevOps/Data projects, we will bring on 2 new team members each to kick off those teams and work with our lead team to draft a plan and roadmap.  New Projects We are adding two new projects to the dGTC workstream. The Sybil Score Aggregation project aims to solve the problem of making it easy to consume and make decisions based on sybil score data from multiple sources. It is fairly clear that no single provider is reliable enough on its own and aggregating the outputs from these providers in a way that makes the score reliable, portable, and easily consumable. This will meet the needs of dGrants by ensuring that legitimate contributions are given appropriate weight at the end of the grant round, thus ensuring fair distribution of the funds. To simplify the end goal here would be to have a robust identity aggregator which would be able to connect to different identity providers (entirely configurable) allowing users to link their identity and share it with dApps. This platform/protocol should be decentralized/distributed and open however never expose a users private data. The DevOps / Data projects started within the FDD workstream lead by Philip Hutchins (the lead of this workstream) and is now moving under the dGTC workstream. The DevOps project aims to standardize CI/CD and security practice throughout the DAO and act as a service provider to the Gitcoin DAO workstreams. The Data project aims to coordinate the standardization of data needs across the DAO and to build a data lake enabling reporting, analytics, and feed our machine learning platform. Once the DevOps and Data teams have some momentum, we plan on building out the machine learning portion of the data team to move the sybil resistance effort to within the DAO.
