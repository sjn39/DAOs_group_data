Paragraph Summary MIP40c3-SP46 adds the budget for Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance. It contains:  Total Budget Cap: The hard limit voted on by Governance First-month forecast: The actual first month estimated expenses Breakdown of Permanent Team for the expected first payment (January)   Specification  Motivation Based on the nature of the work done by the Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF), the budget reflects the needs of the team to ensure continuity of the work described in our MIP39c2-SP27. This is summarized in, but not limited to:  Maintaining Financial Statements, Reporting, and existing Dashboards Driving alignment and facilitating discussion for Strategic Focus Areas & KPIs Tracking, consolidating, and reporting Core Unit expenses to the DAO Institutional vault analysis & deal negotiations Oracle gas modeling and risk mitigation Asset-Liability Management   Core Unit ID SF-001  Budget Implementation The SF budget is designed with the following in mind:  Paying for the operational costs to run the core unit Having a buffer for unexpected legal, technical, or financial problems  Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders make a commitment to: A continuous funding model similar to those proposed by RISK-001, SES-001, and DUX-001. If any modifications are needed, they would be done on a six-month basis through \u201cModify Core Unit Budget Subproposal Process\u201d (MIP40c3 subproposals.) If modifications are not proposed, the monthly payment amount gets rolled over from the initial proposal, if our work meets community and MKR holders expectations and demands.  Smart Contract Implementations  This budget implementation uses the DssVest. This can be changed if needed to any method achieving similar objectives. The first vesting budget will be in place from February 2022 to January 2023 included. It will be renewed each year.

You can approximate the average comp by person by taking the monthly total and dividing by 4. 66,000 / 4 = 16,500 per month or 198,000 per year. As mentioned, the compensation for unfilled positions may differ significantly from the average depending on the candidate\u2019s experience and what is negotiated.     MadShills:  However, at the same time you are also suggesting fully transparent and personal DSSVest streams for the two proposed FTE which are NOT private, so I do not understand the claim to privacy. Am I missing something?   At this time we are only doing DSSVest for the MKR compensation component as that has specifically been requested by some MKR holders. ",

Currently no auditor\u2019s wallets meet the requirements for be governance recognized, so I would appreciate any feedback in creating a better standard. With that said I do not envision requiring an auditors flow in the update, but would like to make it more compatible so the DAO can get a higher level of transparency (wallets and their contacts aggregated and publicly accessible) and security (through Proxy spending power).

Paragraph Summary MIP39c2-SP27 adds Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance Core Unit. Its mission is to provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.  Specification  Motivation I joined the DAO almost exactly a year ago, initially as an investor to learn more about the project and direction of the DAO. I was particularly interested in the RWF CU and after discussing my background with @amyjung, she recommended I connect with @SebVentures. As I continued to get more and more involved in the community and working with Seb, I saw tremendous opportunity to add value through building out the financial foundation Seb laid down. The intellectual curiosity, openness, and desire of the DAO to create and grow a more robust, transparent, and secure financial system is deeply motivating. Adding in the mandate to fight the most challenging problem humanity has faced - climate change - and I could not be more excited to do everything I can to support the DAO and its mission.  Core Unit ID SF-001  Core Unit Name Strategic Finance  Core Unit Facilitator Mark Phillips (@Aes)  Core Unit Mandate  Mission Provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.  Vision Our vision is to provide the most accurate and clear financial reporting across the entire crypto industry, leveraging the transparency and immutability of the public blockchain to ultimately provide financials data that exceeds the requirements of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). Additionally, we seek to provide the DAO and MakerDAO stakeholders with relevant financial information to help assess the health of the protocol. We will accomplish this by:  Providing clear, easily digestible financial information to the DAO that enables stakeholders to make informed decisions for the protocol Building financial dashboards and tools that provide real-time financial data directly from the blockchain so stakeholders can understand the health of the protocol Partnering with SES to implement standardized and automated expense reporting vs budgets Collaborating with Growth and Risk Core Units to provide financial analysis of prospective deals Working with the Protocol Engineering and Oracle Core Units to model growth opportunities and risks Asset-liability management and innovation through investing protocol assets to generate yield (real-world assets, DeFi, etc.) Facilitating recurring strategic reviews to set a strategic action plan and Accounting, solvency, liquidity, and potential regulatory reporting   Strategy & Current Work SF encompasses the traditional finance functions, including financial reporting, planning, analysis, and accounting, as well as an advisory component that helps facilitate consensus around the DAO\u2019s strategic priorities. This work, as detailed below and in the \u2018RWF Efforts\u2019 section, will be continued with the approval of the SF Core Unit. This work includes but is not limited to:  Publishing Monthly Financial Statements Posting Monthly Financial Reports Reporting Actual Monthly Expenses & Forecasting by Core Unit Partnering with GRO-001 Facilitator @Nadia and RISK-001 Facilitator @Primoz to negotiate terms for the Nexo Institutional Vault as well as another 600M+ undisclosed prospective IV customer Maintenance of the Real-Time Financial Dashboard Forecasting Revenue and Profitability Analyzing Profitability by Vault Building new SQL queries to support the Strategic Focus Areas for the Recurring Strategy Reviews and KPIs  Our approach to working with the DAO is focused on collaboration. We believe partnering with the other Core Units and MKR holders, with each bringing our strengths and expertise to the table will yield multiplicative benefits compared to working purely in silos. This does not mean the Core Unit is dependent on other Core Units to execute the current work and envisioned scope; only that results will be maximized through collaboration. This collaboration is already happening today and will only get better moving forward.  Roadmap The SF CU will initially focus on continuing to build a solid financial reporting foundation and continue its work on the RWF FP&A roadmap, prioritizing work based on community feedback. The current roadmap includes:  Create a Strategic Action Plan (STRAP) to develop plans to achieve DAO-wide long-term goals by facilitating:  Determining the protocol\u2019s strategic position Prioritization of Objectives Developing & formalizing the strategic plan The assessment of executing the plan The review and revision of the plan as necessary   Facilitate recurring Strategy reviews to:  Assess how CUs are executing the mission and agreed-upon strategy Understand issues and obstacles the DAO needs to address Discuss new opportunities that have arisen that the DAO may want to pursue Decide if adjustments to the plan are needed Facilitate optimal capital allocation   Partnering with SES to standardize and automate expense reporting across the DAO  Increase transparency and reporting standards to provide more accountability to CU spend   Build out \u2018Governance Relations\u2019 by partnering with CU leadership to frame and communicate MakerDAO\u2019s strategy, operations & financial results to the community Asset-Liability Management:  Reporting of the current and future balance sheet structure in terms of interest rate, duration, maturity and profitability Researching and proposing ways to optimize the balance sheet allocation Providing insights into borrower risks and analyzing customer capital flows   Financial Reporting & Planning  Monthly Financial Reports Monthly Expense Reports Monthly Revenue & Expense Forecasts Budgeting support through building Budget Templates and providing expense analysis to CUs   KPI dashboard  Building real-time dashboards leveraging on-chain data to measure DAO-approved Strategic Focus Areas and Key Performance Indicators   Real-time Vault Profitability Analysis   Community Involvement  Educate community members in understanding the protocol, its economics, and risk aspects Develop models for community members Review community proposals Provide feedback on business decisions   Team Structure The full team and current budget will be composed of 4 permanent members:  1 Finance & Strategy Facilitator - @Aes  1 Title TBD - @SebVentures  1 Senior Finance Manager 1 Senior Data Analyst  Long-term, we will expand the team to 7 permanent members to include:  1 Senior Financial Analyst 1 Accounting Manager 1 DAO Auditor   RWF Efforts As part of the RWF CU, the team has already delivered a number of reports, models, and financial analyses, including:  Monthly Financial Reports Monthly Financial Statements Real Time Financial Dashboard MakerDAO Expense Reporting MKR Compensation Model A Framework for Valuing MKR Institutional Vault Financial Analysis Budget Simulator with Revenue & Cash Flow Forecast Key Performance Indicator Discussion   Domain Evolution The Strategic Finance Core Unit aims to build a solid financial foundation for the DAO that enables the creation and growth of other specialized financial Core Units with expertise in diverse areas of finance. Some examples include Corp Dev (M&A), Asset-Liability Management, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Governance Relations.

MIP39c2-SP12: Adding Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit   I\u2019d also like to make sure I am very clear on one point. This Core Unit is a highly-collaborative effort and it\u2019s a partnership, not competition, with the key stakeholders in the DAO. CES will continuously work with Protocol Engineering, Oracles, Risk, Real World Finance, and other critical stakeholders   Understand that the DAO cannot mandate good working relationships, but similar to @monkey.irish, I strongly believe in collaboration and believe that it has happened naturally since I started working in RWF and even as an independent community member - volunteering to collaborate with LongForWisdom, Derek, and Planet_X on the MKR compensation guidelines for example.     juan:  Starting the roadmap with a DAO-wide long-term goal, while sharp, might lead to undesirable results (see the previous point).   I strongly believe any organization, centralized or not, needs to have a unified vision to be successful long-term. @rune has provided that vision and now that the DAO has signaled it\u2019s support for it, it\u2019s up to us (the DAO) to execute it. The FS Core Unit\u2019s goal is to aide in and help the DAO understand if we\u2019re on the right path by providing quantifiable KPIs that the DAO aligns on.     juan:  Improving the roadmap so that it has a little more substance to it. This was the main criticism that the Maker Labs proposal received.   More is coming next week when I return from my trip  . As most are likely not aware - I will be out of the country for the next week and given the RFC deadline of December 8th, did not want to risk having these MIPs not get into the January Governance cycle.     MadShills:  If there is a long term desire to grow into a larger core unit with different finance functions and spin out multiple long term core units, perhaps it is better to start with a smaller CU (3 FTE), a focused and concrete objective, and deliver on it well. After, it is easy to come back for more budget after exceeding expectations.   This is how we plan to start - with 2 FTE and a plan to ramp up to 4 FTE in the next year. With how much work there is to be done from a financial perspective, this is a very lean team. Frankly, the DAO is already at a size where we should have a dedicated accountant and auditor but I have left those out for the near term so the CU can focus on building out a solid foundation (building out quality data and reporting is the highest priority today).     MadShills:  A simple MIP budget modification can be submitted prior to each subsequent milestone. Each core unit you desire to incubate could be a simple ask with its own roadmap and business plan. That would leave you always over delivering, while having a clear and transparent use of funds and pristine financials each time. I would encourage this group to work with the SES incubator program or to at least adopt their documentation practices. You cite here you already would like to partner with them-- it seems a natural course.   Just to be clear, I have no plans and do not intend to incubate any new Finance Core Units. Once the team reaches it\u2019s envisioned maximum size (7) we will work with the DAO to determine if more resources are needed. If they are, I would envision that new Core Unit(s) are formed to tackle specific areas, going through the SES incubation program. With that said, the FS CU may be the first \u2018connection\u2019 people with a Finance/Accounting background make within the DAO, because that will be the work they\u2019ll likely be drawn to and have an understanding of (compared to PE or Oracles for example). If someone comes to our team and is interested in forming a new Core Unit, I would send them directly to SES. ",

Not 2. @flipflopflapdelegate I\u2019m not aware that RWF Portfolio Core Units and RWF Compliance Core Unit will do ALM. Moreover, those CUs don\u2019t exist yet. The last RWF budget was alluding to ALM for 2022. The Financial Strategy CU is a spin-off from RWF to split finance and RWA matters. The next facilitator of RWF is obviously free to do ALM as well. @Allan_Pedersen also put an ALM CU separately in his model. ALM is seen here as the art and science of optimizing the balance sheet to fit the risk appetite and profitability expectation of MKR holders. Nevertheless, it should be clear that the role here is to analyze, monitor, suggest, not to decide nor to execute. Financial institutions have an Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) for decision-making. This should be an MKR committee or a PPG where, in the end, MKR holders are voting anyway. Execution should be done by passive smart contract like it is customary for MakerDAO. One of the outputs of my work will be to provide an ALM Report which will be one of the inputs of such an ALCO (and inform all MKR holders on the MakerDAO ALM situation). Another output would be linked to the Strategic Action Plan. An ALM view is necessary. I\u2019ve touched on that point on the MKR valuation framework showing you can\u2019t have exponential growth, burn all profits as MKR and keep @Primoz happy. We need a model of the current balance sheet risks & profitability but a way to forecast it and compare it with the objectives expected by MKR holders. Merged with the work of the rest of the Financial Strategy CU, this would provide a finance view on the impact of the proposals (like Institutional Vault). Inputs of the ALM will come from other CUs, like the Capital at Risk from Risk, \u201ccontractual\u201d terms and expectations from Growth regarding Institutional Vaults, capital cost and \u201ccontractual\u201d/behavioral maturities coming from RWA CUs, off-balance-sheet interest rate risks from DECO, \u2026 It is not something new to me as I was leading a 5-year Strategic planning project for a multi-national insurance company, part of which was to create a model to forecast the balance sheet in the future based on inputs. We have started to work on ALM with @monet-supply and @Primoz. Others can join the effort. I\u2019ve worked on the balance sheet and liquidity (peg keeping) concerns of MakerDAO for more than a year. ALM components are present in the monthly financial reports, but it is time to update them. My \u201cWhere is DAI\u201d reports are far from enough to understand the dynamics of DAI demand and liquidity risks. ",

Personally, I do not consider MakerDAO a \u201cFinancial Institution\u201d, it is perhaps why I was surprised of the \u201cALM\u201d title. From a traditional finance point of view, in the Real World\u2013I think we can agree that an ALM is responsible for the following but not limited to:  Interest rate risk management Liquidity risk Risk management of financial derivatives Managing credit quality Forward-looking projections and datasets Datasets in quantifiable mathematical measures  And last but not least, as you know\u2013ALM teams oversee the entire balance sheet of an organization\u2013which includes coordinating with a lot of teams/departments (time-consuming)\u2013and this view is also outlined here:  image1302\u00d7136 60.8 KB  All in all I\u2019m trying to understand how \u201cALM\u201d style duties between so many different CU team members will mesh together, and not overlap one another.

                    "content": "    MadShills:  I would personally focus on these points and the financial role and needs of the DAO. As you mention it is already enough work, needed now, and falls within the core competencies and background of the team. A core unit like this probably needs to choose focusing on operations and strategy or finance but doing both seems like neither fish nor fowl, and it creates a centralized dependency inconsistent with DAO best practices.   The scope of the Core Unit is well within the traditional Corporate Finance competencies and I am happy to discuss my business background in more detail than what\u2019s listed in the Facilitator Onboarding MIP if you would like. In my experience the scope of a CFO greatly exceeds what you reference - a Finance organization is deeply involved with strategy and there are specific Finance business functions that explicitly support it (Corp Dev, M&A, Strategy). There\u2019s a reason why the #1 company CEOs have worked at is McKinsey and why so many CEOs also have a finance background. Regardless, the primary focus of this Core Unit as listed in the Strategy & Current Work section (newly added) is traditional FP&A. It seems there is some confusion around the mandate of the Core Unit  given it\u2019s name, perhaps I will change it. What you\u2019ve seen from RWF through now has been mostly the result of Seb and myself working part time for the DAO (as Seb was focused on the leading RWF onboarding and risk assessments and I was still working full-time as a Sr Finance Manager). On Day 1, the Core Unit will already be significantly increasing the output of what we\u2019ve published so far (see RWF efforts). Once we have a couple more resources onboarded, we will have the bandwidth required to accomplish the scope.     MadShills:  I do not disagree the DAO still needs a cohesive strategy, but it seems that coupling the role of what would be an executive committee in a traditional org (CEO (sets vision), COO (executes on vision/plan), CFO (manages and allocates resources to execute on plan), etc.) into one core unit defeats the purpose of decentralization and also creates rigidity for other CU. I am not sure other CU are going to want to have another CU in charge of evaluating their performance when that is the role of MKR holders, delegates, and voting committees.   As stated in my response to Juan, this Core unit does not set the vision - that was already done by Rune and the DAO has signaled it\u2019s support for it, nor does it execute the vision. What it does do is facilitate the consensus seeking of the Strategic Focus Areas and KPIs the DAO will use to measure our success in executing Rune\u2019s vision, and transparently reports it leveraging real time dashboards and the immutability of the blockchain. This Core Unit does not unilaterally decide these metrics - the original set of approved SFAs were essentially taken from Rune\u2019s clean money initiative post. The drafted KPIs were a collaboration between RWF, Growth, Risk, some large MKR holders, and a few delegates.     MadShills:  For example, capital allocation and strategy should probably managed by committees of stakeholders (including MKR holders, delegates, with experts and CU members providing input and opinions. Again, something more like voting committees @rune has mentioned in the past. Not sure there should be a CU in charge of managing other CU performance or assessment. We need our CU to be motivated and competent enough to manage and communicate their own KPIs and their delivery or failure to do so. Maximal independence and maximal accountability.   I\u2019m assuming this comment is referring to the individual Core Unit Scorecards in the strategy deck. To be clear - the FS Core Unit is not evaluating the performance of any Core Units. We are here to facilitate that discussion for MKR holders, delegates, and voting committees to make those decisions. Each approved Core Unit already has a mandate and goals in their MIP39c2s. During a Strategic Review, each Core Unit will populate and fill out their own Scorecard, giving themselves their own scores on these goals - then present this scorecard to MKR Holders, Delegates, and stakeholders. Some Core Units are already doing this today. The benefit of a single recurring review is to have a one-stop-shop for getting an update on how the Core Units are progressing against their mandates. Today, we have 19 Core Units already approved with more being incubated - it is simply not practical or realistic to expect MKR holders to comb through the forums looking for Core Unit updates one by one that do not share any transparency standards. As @wouter astutely pointed out, there are additional very important metrics for us consider - to copy here:  Security / risk Governance effectiveness Community (workforce) health  These are not currently within the scope of the recurring strategy reviews and I believe would be well suited within another recurring review focused on operations. I would be happy to help facilitate consensus building on metrics that support these focus areas but most inputs would come from the subject matter experts (PE, IS, GovAlpha, SES). ",

This Core Unit will be an important step to help change that and enter a phase where we continuously improve, refine and evolve the Core Units to provide better value creation and better work environments. I want to emphasise, this kind of CU would not play the role of decision maker, but rather would be a professional source of opinions and advice for the actual decision makers (SR and MKR voters) to base their decisions on. So it\u2019s not a \u201cCFO\u201d Core Unit, it\u2019s an \u201cAdvisor to the CFO\u201d Core Unit, which in my opinion is incredibly important and needed at the stage of complexity we are now at. I will soon be posting a document on the \u201cdecentralized workforce\u201d that discusses the importance of these kind of supporting Core Units, among other things, that can possibly help create some broader context around how useful this Core Unit can be, but also how it will have very limited power and a lot of checks and balances. I\u2019m also very happy that this is a good place for Seb to move to following his resignation as Facilitator of the RWF Core Unit. I\u2019ve discussed this with Aes and he has assured me that he only chose to include Seb in the proposal on the basis of Sebs unique background and skillset that is perfectly geared for financial data and balance sheet work in a blockchain setting, which is fundamentally required for Aes\u2019 vision of this Core Unit and the advice, transparency and data it will provide to the community. So to be clear this is not some kind of political outcome, puppeteering or horse trading situation, and we should fully expect and demand high quality work that is well worth the expense from Seb, Aes and the entire Core Unit.

                    "content": "    Deimos:  some time ago we had project kompass and you are there Project Compass: DAO Vision Setting Working Group - #5 by Aes  after 3 or 4 month the result was well judge for yourselve   Not sure what you\u2019re talking about. I was not a part of that working group and simply voiced my opinion as a community member.     Deimos:  can you please give example of the path to go to achieve the first 2? also can you please give insight to know if seb want to step down and support your cu or this is safety net?   The strategic position is where we sit in the market relative, what our strategic advantages/disadvantages are, etc. Maker competes with DeFi lending protocols such as AAVE and Compound as well as CeFi lending alternatives such as Circle and BlockFi. One example of an advantage is the ability to mint Dai, whereas the rates competitors offer in peer-to-peer lending can vary greatly due to user deposited liquidity. One disadvantage we have is that our lending is capital inefficient in that we require a much higher amount of collateral to provide a loan. Seb has already voluntarily stepped down. I\u2019m happy to engage on valid points but if you\u2019re going to personally attack my team or myself I simply will no longer engage with you. I\u2019ve been a member of the DAO for nearly a year and have contributed a lot of hours trying to help without any compensation (excluding source cred), as has Seb prior to RWF onboarding. We are staking our personal reputations and going all-in to do everything we can to see this project succeed. ",
