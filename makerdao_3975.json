                    "content": "Today SEC Chair Gary Gensler voiced his own personal remarks at the Aspen Security Forum. Mr. Gensler who is very familiar with crypto and is very familiar with commodity laws, focused on:  Investor protection in crypto: \u201cRight now, we just don\u2019t have enough investor protection in crypto.\u201d  Emphasis on what might happen if folks turn a blind eye:  \u201cIn many cases, investors aren\u2019t able to get rigorous, balanced, and complete information. If we don\u2019t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt.\u201d  In his opinion, it sounds like he believes most tokens are \u201csecurities\u201d and makes reference to former SEC Chair Clayton statement from 2018: \u201cTo the extent that digital assets like [initial coin offerings, or ICOs] are securities \u2014 and I believe every ICO I have seen is a security \u2014 we have jurisdiction, and our federal securities laws apply.\u201d[7]    I find myself agreeing with Chairman Clayton. You see, generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there\u2019s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects. I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.   Firmly opines his view of Decentralize Finance and how platforms listing multiple tokens are more than likely offering securities:    Next, I\u2019d like to discuss crypto trading platforms, lending platforms, and other \u201cdecentralized finance\u201d (DeFi) platforms.   The world of crypto finance now has platforms where people can trade tokens and other venues where people can lend tokens. I believe these platforms not only can implicate the securities laws; some platforms also can implicate the commodities laws and the banking laws.   A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token\u2019s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.    Chair Gensler also provided his personal take on Stablecoins:    How do you trade crypto-to-crypto? Usually, somebody uses stablecoins.   In July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token.[11]   Thus, the use of stablecoins on these platforms may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, tax compliance, sanctions, and the like. This affects our national security, too.   Further, these stablecoins also may be securities and investment companies. To the extent they are, we will apply the full investor protections of the Investment Company Act and the other federal securities laws to these products.   IMO, this is as close as clarity as we are going to get, for the moment. In POKER, you would call this a \u201cTELL\u201d. Providing, or Requiring some type of Cover to All Vault Owners via a smart contract from a DeFi platform, like Nexus Mutual, or other Cover Protocols. Meaning:  It will be a requirement to first purchase Cover, and then Stake Cover when opening a Vault. Or, use a portion of the collateral to automatically perform a transaction to acquire Cover before end-user is allow to draw DAI.  PROS:   Vault Owners will have some protection. MakerDAO will take steps and can iterate on how to protect Vault Owners. CONS:  It will be costly, time-consuming for PE, and some might say that MakerDAO has the ability to mint MKR as an option for downside protection.    Should MakerDAO Require Vault Owners to Have \u201cInsurance\u201d Protection?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters        OPTIONAL: Should the Maker Community Start Talking to U.S. Regulators and Ask What Can Be Done To Comply With Regulatory Framework?  Yes No Too Early Too Late Abstain     0 voters     Please note\u2013the last Optional Poll question was formulated based on Mr. Gensler stating that the writing of regulatory guidance has already been written on the wall: \"First, many of these tokens are offered and sold as securities. There\u2019s actually a lot of clarity on that front. In the 1930s, Congress established the definition of a security, which included about 20 items, like stock, bonds, and notes. One of the items is an investment contract.\" I will let this Informal/Informative Poll run until 19-08-2021 and hope to hear you voice your opinion\u2013or, Please let me know if you interpreted his statement differently. Thank you! ",

There are many consumer protection rules around forced insurance add-on sales and it\u2019s generally thought of as bad. eg Third Line Forcing.   Nexus and the entire DeFi insurance vertical likely doesn\u2019t have enough coverage to meet all that demand, though this would likely change, you\u2019d end up with price gouging issues.   Deciding who has to purchase based on location seems like a non-starter to me.   The best approach for mandatory coverage is to build it in at the protocol level, for example MakerDAO could buy backstop coverage from Nexus up to certain limits. This effectively socialises the cost through slightly higher interest rates. There are quite a few benefits here, and while our previous proposal on this topic didn\u2019t make it through signalling late last year we have much higher capacity now so it may be worth revisiting.

Thank you for the feedback Hugh. I\u2019m no insurance/cover expert\u2013but yes, I was thinking along the lines of MakerDAO somehow offering backstop coverage thru Stability Fees, or perhaps via Smart Contract language that provides proof of insurance protection with a protocol like Nexus Mutual. And yes, available to All vault owners (not just Americanos).     AstronautThis:  Whatever system you put in place to determine that, there\u2019s a way to circumvent it and mask your location.   Indeed. But at least on the protocol level and in a \u201ccompliant\u201d manner, MakerDAO has tried to offer Vault Owners the option of downside protection.  And yes, I referred to only \u201cAmericans\u201d bases on the personal thinking of SEC Chair Gensler. Let\u2019s hope his teammates, like Commissioner Hester Pierce, ( see her Tweet ) can convince Gensler to rethink on what I believe is an early indication of what could be the future SEC framework for crypto.     andresovich:  I mean, if the token was built and meant to be used worldwide, it probably shouldn\u2019t be subject to USA regulations.   I\u2019m with you man. But these regulators, they see it differently than you and I. It\u2019s up to us, the community to convince them otherwise. ",

I agree this is the way to go if we were to do something like this. That said, I was looking back through the original proposal and @MakerMan, @Spidomo, @iammeeoh and others brought up some great points. One of which stood out to me in particular might be worth revisiting given our recent concerns surrounding stablecoins:    MIP13c3-SP8: Maker Protocol Cover with Nexus Mutual (Declaration of Intent)   we might want to insure ourself against the crash in value of any of the stablecoins we use. This is because it would be very unlikely that we can handle such situation with the tools at our disposal (margin calls and auction mechanisms) since the coll. ratio is 101%. But hopefully we will reduce our exposure to stablecoins in the future.   ",

                    "content": " 1. Protocol-Level Coverage  I voted NO to mandatory coverage because it should be the users choice however if MakerDAO did choose to build in coverage at the protocol level, Armor has created a library and client to help DeFi protocols simply and independently integrate their external smart contracts to buy coverage from Nexus Mutual. Using this library, one can quickly (and entirely on-chain) determine the price of coverage, deposit funds, subscribe to a plan, submit proof-of-loss, and claim funds when a hack occurs. Review a demo smart contract showing a subscription flow here.  2. Regulatory Guidance  I voted YES to talking with Regulators because the Maker community is in a unique position due to a number of factors to help them actually understand DeFi in the first place and work with it. They don\u2019t even have to directly represent Maker if the DAO funded and supported LexDAO who is already working on it:   Discord    Join the LexDAO Discord Server! Check out the LexDAO community on Discord - hang out with 768 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat.       3. DeFi-Native FDIC-Style Coverage  Armor recently launched \u201cDeFi-Native FDIC-Style Coverage\u201d via Shield Vaults:   armor.fi    Armor.Fi Armor is a decentralized brokerage for cover underwritten by Nexus Mutual's blockchain-based insurance alternative      Right now a user of Yearn\u2019s DAI vault may deposit their yvDAI into Armor\u2019s Shield Vault and have their coverage paid for via yield, at lower rates than if the user went directly through Nexus Mutual. This is in Beta at the moment and deposit caps may be unlocked soon. Lower Rates? Usually most smart contract exploits are resolved before they cause a major drain to the total value locked (TVL). Shield Vaults provide partial coverage to users making maximal use of coverage capacity available, solving both capacity and cost issues while remaining suitable to the ecosystem. How It Works A user may deposit their yield-bearing tokens into a Shield Vault, and receive arTokens in return. This insured token provides user deposits in the Shield Vault with FDIC-style partial coverage. For example, let\u2019s say a Yearn Shield Vault contains $250m in assets and maintains $50m in FDIC-style partial coverage. A hack causes $10m in losses. When a successful claim payout is made by Nexus Mutual, users are made whole. If a loss exceeds the $50m in active coverage, the payout will be equally distributed between users who lost funds.  4. Available Now in Gnosis Safe Multisig  As of this week, this is now also available via gnosis safe multisig so that DAOs and Institutional users can deposit their DAI to Yearn vaults via the Gnosis app, then deposit to Armor\u2019s Shield Vaults to get coverage. Just visit the Apps tab in your Gnosis Safe Multisig to try it. ",

Personally, I have looked at the requirements to be an FDIC covered entity/provider, and they don\u2019t make it easy\u2013painful to be become FDIC covered TBH. I hope you guys keep iterating and make the FDIC-Style Coverage come into fruition for the entire DeFi ecosystem. All-in-all I believe that we need to start to think about how we can communicate with Regulators, and yes, even politicians. Personally I like to see the entire Maker Community make a push for such, even if most of us are not Americans\u2013we ALL need to fight this battle together.
