Motivation This proposal will focus on the collateral onboarding process blueprint for submitting MIP12 Subproposals (MIP12-SPs). The subproposals allow any community member to propose new risk parameters, oracles, and adapters for a new, or existing collateral type. Additionally, it will also define priority polls and the overall collateral onboarding process requirements. Furthermore, it allows domain teams to execute on collateral onboarding via the executive vote. This is the last step that needs to be completed when you have the risk construct with risk parameters based on a risk model ratified through MIP11.  Specification / Proposal Details  MIP11 Components   MIP12c1: Domain Team Requirements for Onboarding Collateral Type to the Maker Protocol  MIP12c2: Proposing New Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters  MIP12c3: Collateral Type Checklist (Governance)    MIP12c1: Domain Team Requirements for Onboarding Collateral Type to the Maker Protocol   A Risk team (elected through MIP7) builds and approves their risk construct based on a ratified general model from MIP11 (Collateral Onboarding General Risk Model Management).  A Smart Contracts team (elected through MIP7) builds and approves its collateral adapter, medianizer, oracle security module and executive vote code and the technical risk assessments of these smart contracts.  An Oracles team (elected through MIP7), updates the oracle operations through MIP10 (Oracle Management) and then approves of the currently active price feeds as well as builds and approves their oracle security audit/risk assessment. (Optional) A Legal team (elected through MIP7) has created and approved the legal risk assessment of the collateral type based on the work completed by the above domain teams.    MIP12c2: Proposing New Risk Parameters, Oracles, and Collateral Adapters Description: This is a technical process MIP component for submitting MIP12c2-SPs that allows any community member to propose new risk parameters, oracles, and adapters for a new, or existing collateral type, based on the work products of domain teams. MIP12-Subproposals (MIP12c2-SPs) MUST contain the following three deliverables in the specification section:  A risk construct based on an active general risk model by a ratified risk team and the results of polls that define all risk parameters for the collateral type. A security audit and risk assessment of a deployed and operational collateral adapter, medianizer, oracle security module and executive vote code by a smart contracts domain team. A security audit and risk assessment of the current status of the oracle price feeds for supporting the new collateral type by an oracle domain team.

Domain teams give greenlight via MIP8. Community is like, \u201cHell yeah!\u201d, greenlight via MIP9 - this happens in the 4th week of a monthly governance cycle.    Proposer points to a functional set of Oracles that satisfies everyone (via sulfurous vents/Solidity). A risk model actually exists via MIP11, and says that this new collateral is A++. Smart contract team codes the spell, and puts it up for an Executive.  My question: MIP9 must happen in the last week of a given month. Is there a time limit from when that occurs to actually voting on an Executive that will lift the hat onto this spell? i.e. does it need to happen in the next month? The next 1-3 months? My concern is that allowing it to extend indefinitely after MIP9 and MIP11 could result in community sentiment/real risk changes that are not reflected in the overall process. ",
