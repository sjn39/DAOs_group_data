                    "content": " Sentence Summary MakerDAO will be receiving an airdrop equivalent to 1% of initial voting power for the new Velodrome protocol launching on Optimism on May 31st.  What is Velodrome? Velodrome is an AMM modeled on Solidly (1)(2) that seeks to provide deep liquidity and low slippage to token pairs critical for the growth of the Optimism ecosystem. Velodrome\u2019s model incentivizes liquidity by giving token lockers the ability to direct the protocol\u2019s emissions to their chosen pairs. In return, lockers receive 100% of the trading fees generated by the pairs they vote for, any bribes directed toward these pairs, and an anti-dilutive rebase (if $VELO tokens are locked for the max duration of four years). More information on Velodrome can be found on their Medium.  What benefit does the veNFT provide? The veNFT will allow MakerDAO to direct emissions to the liquidity pools of their choosing, increasing liquidity of the chosen pairs and receiving all trading fees and bribes for those pools.  How should emissions be directed? We believe liquidity and emissions should be directed to DAI pairs to continue building liquidity for DAI on Optimism. Based on the Velodrome team\u2019s analysis, the optimal pairs to incentivize based on 1% voting power are DAI/USDC and DAI/OP. In their model, this would represent 20% APY for $3-4M TVL. Emissions are directed weekly and can be changed if the DAO decides incentivizing other LPs will create more value.  Why should the DAO care? Although Solidly attracted over $2.24B of TVL less than two weeks after launching, issues in the design and the departure of key members pushed the project into irrelevancy. The VELO team have thought deeply about why Solidly failed and are making key changes to Solidly\u2019s mechanisms. Strategic Finance believes that Velodrome could be a significant contender for amassing DAI liquidity on Optimism. To the extent the project is successful, DAI liquidity on Optimism will be significantly improved and the MakerDAO protocol will receive a new income stream from the trading fees and bribes on the Velodrome protocol.  Management of veNFT Given how soon Velodrome is launching, the Velodrome team will initially manage the veNFT on MakerDAO\u2019s behalf until the DAO is ready to manage it. The Velodrome team has recommended the following pairs for launch which they believe will maximize fees and DAI liquidity:  DAI/USDC DAI/OP  Note - Only two pairs are recommended to ensure emissions are high enough to attract adequate liquidity    Should MakerDAO incentivize the pairs recommended by the Velodrome team?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Voting to direct $VELO emissions occurs on a weekly basis, every week. The Velodrome team plans to add functionality for carryover voting, but on launch, voting will be manual. As a result, a Governance owned multi-sig would enable the DAO and signers to direct emissions while minimizing Governance overhead. Note - Multi-sig signers will be responsible for voting the veNFT every week once transferred, until carryover voting is enabled. Multi-sig signers will also be responsible for managing the trading fees accrued (based on the pending outcome of the bottom poll). Signers for the multi-sig will be made up of the following trusted community members: @adcv, @luca_pro, @hexonaut, @prose11, @Aes . If anyone else is interested in being a signer, happy to accommodate.    Should we transfer veNFT to a Governance owned multi-sig using MIP47 (4 of 5)?  Yes No, use a Governance owned address (requires executive approval to direct emissions) Abstain     0 voters      veNFT Strategy MakerDAO must also consider what to do with the trading fees earned through the trading activity on the liquidity pools it incentivizes.    What should MakerDAO do with the trading fees?  Compound fees earned into $veVELO to further incentivize DAI liquidity and potentially expand to new pairs when appropriate Send trading fees to the MakerDAO Optimism Governance Address MakerDAO should not participate and sell the veNFT, assuming a market for the veNFT exists Abstain     0 voters     Disclosure: I am long $WEVE (<1.5% of my MKR holdings).
