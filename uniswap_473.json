However, after circulating around the UNI community Forum for the past weeks, it is not clear to me how the Development team and the UNI Governance work\function together. Is there even common goals? It may appear to me that there is some disconnect, but I may be wrong. I am just trying to understand how those two \u201centities\u201d interact and reach common goals. Ultimately, the UNI community was formed because the development team wanted to. Shine in your comments or opinions. ",

What we get now is big delegates like monet-supply  and coopa toopa something or other guy (I forget his name, sorry) just abandoning proposals w/o even giving a reason. Quality discussions that went on for more than a month, down the drain. Radio-silence. I tried to continue the discussion in the Discord, but got censored by Micah who admits that he doesn\u2019t follow the debates we have here (and who also claims that UNI\u2019s sole purpose is to fund development !). So, yeah, it is very grim right now. I think everyone can admit it. But it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t change. Uniswap could hire someone nice, for starters. Someone that takes care of the relationships with the community. In a couple of months, Uni gov. could be as active as Compound/Maker gov, etc. ",
