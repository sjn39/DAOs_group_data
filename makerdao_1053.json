                    "content": " Overview MakerDAO has implemented the DAI Direct Deposit Module (D3M) which has the ability to distribute DAI loans to real world home owners through the Bacon protocol. Utilizing D3M, DAI lending capital would be deposited into a newly created Bacon DAI pool that limits lending participation to MakerDAO only. BaconDAO will oversee the pool and would select home loans based on a prescribed mandate (FICO score, LTV etc.) from the MakerDAO community.  Signal Request Bacon protocol is signaling to onboard a D3M for the creation of a Bacon DAI pool.  Pros   Single onboarding procedure that can scale both the amount of capital used and the number of home loans over time   Broad potential distribution of DAI to home owners in the US   Higher risk adjusted yields across a diversified set of home loans   Maker selects the underwriting criteria to use, allowing for investing in loans that are highly aligned with Maker\u2019s vision of funding sustainability initiatives   Bacon will develop and maintain the D3M integration in line with the CES enablement strategy   Governance has direct control over DAI supply that is added to Bacon through the Debt Ceiling    Cons  Smart contract risk   Risk Mitigation   The whitelisting of addresses with deposit functionality reduces exploit risk (Maker would be the only liquidity provider)   Credit Risk assessment of borrowers is performed by loan originators using the industry-standard FICO-score.    Effect In the event this signal is successful, Bacon will prioritize the implementation of a DAI Bacon pool D3M, and will consult with the Maker team regularly. After this, with all details fleshed out, the proposal will move to a Maker community vote.    Should Maker Onboard a Bacon D3M?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps Added by @LongForWisdom - 2022-05-08 Off-chain poll will end on 2022-05-19T00:00:00Z. If it is successful at that time, it will move on-chain in the \u2018Investigation Implementation\u2019 format. ",

A \u201ccrypto-mortgage\u201d is a loan collateralized against both a residential property and a borrower\u2019s crypto assets. Instead, Bacon is originating Fannie/Freddie conforming mortgages and passing through the interest payments to bHome holders. It also incentivizes bHome holders via Bacon emissions. I guess my immediate concerns/questions are around Bacon\u2019s edge in underwriting/production of a well-understood and crowded asset class. How does Bacon compete with these scaled operators? Is it speed-to-close as is so often the value prop with RE lending upstarts? ",

                    "content": "Hi Matt, nice to meet you.  I am the CEO and co-founder of LoanSnap and we created the Bacon Protocol.  Thanks for your interest in our project and here are answers to your questions  What debt ceiling do you propose for the D3M? We are proposing $10M and are open to feedback What is the background of Bacon Protocol/Bacon DAO? The protocol was designed and developed by LoanSnap Holdings Inc  It was launched in Sept of 2021  The project has been under development for about 3yrs. How many loans has the protocol provided, to how many borrowers, and what average rate? What is the total value of those loans?    This information is kept real time on chain but can also be accessed by viewing www.baconcoin.com  We believe a key component of our stablecoin is transparency so anyone at any time can determine borrowers, rate and total value of the loans        Could you describe the general profile of your protocol\u2019s borrowers to date? How many have defaulted? The loans backing bHOME (the stablecoin) are underwritten to fannie mae guidelines This ensures we can sell the loans to Fannie Mae directly to their cash window https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/  What are the capital or illiquidity risks with Bacon loans? To what extent can these be mitigated?    Generally these types of loans called qualified mortgages and underwritten to Fannie guidelines are considered high quality.  We mitigate capital and illiquidity risk by maintaining excellent relationships with purchases of these types of loans   We already have an existing mortgage business so maintaining these relationships is core to our business as it is to other originators who will join the platform    What would happen if a borrower defaults on a loan? It would be great if you could walk through your procedure and its implications for Maker.    This is a standard process in mortgage.  If a borrower defaults (which servicers work to avoid) then the servicer forecloses on the house and then sells the asset.  Since the loan to value is generally low the result is cash back to the protocol which can be reinvested or stay in the pool.  The highest I have seen across residential loan types is just over 10% and a more average default rate is about 3%   ",

Is your concern that we wouldn\u2019t be able to originate enough volume to satisfy the appetite for the coin?  We have originated over $2 billion in loans to date and only a fraction are going to the protocol today.  Given we close loans in 24hrs and guarantee 15 days, yes we believe we are competitive with others and have the ability in the short run to generate approximately $200 million of assets to the protocol per month ",

From what I can tell, you\u2019ve radically under-sold the value proposition and opportunity in this signal request. In the attention economy, loudness wins. This is not a product that has been proposed to the DAO before (I think) and it seems to me that the combination of A) tokenized liens and B) potential scale of resi mortgage production is unique. Do you have a short video or write-up that more fully fleshes out the opportunity for the community Low engagement begets low engagement. @Recognized-Delegates please take a brief look at this\u2014Richard Branson is in the equity. Few questions:  You are pitching a Maker-tailored D3M pool. What will the Bacon token emissions be for the pool? 3.5% as suggested on the Bacon website or higher at the quantum of a 5-10MM DAI pool? Looks like Total Value Locked is $7MM but Total Home Value is $44MM across 35 homes. From looking into the \u201ceggs\u201d section of the site, it does indeed look like Bacon is originating ultra low-LTV mortgages at the moment. What is the profile of borrower looking for such a low-leverage product? Are some of these shorter-term bridge loans for reno? Or are they all longer-term stabilized? Is LoanSnap selling off partial exposures to bHome holders or are these loans being originated afresh? In a regulatory capacity, how are you dealing with the yield-bearing nature of bHome? It is indeed LoanSnap the entity as opposed to a diffuse set of token holders, for example, that is doing the underwriting and driving the profit, right? Please synthesize your motivation for approaching MakerDAO into a few sentences.  ",

A video is a cool idea. We\u2019ll flesh out a more detailed writeup in the meantime. To answer your questions:   The 3.5% emission would be the base emission in bHOME, DAI or another USD equivalent returned from the underlying asset\u2019s payments. The BACON (governance) emission would also go to the D3M pool and is much higher (52% currently) and could be at a negotiated rate for a large pool if agreed by our DAO.   We\u2019ve been conservative on the lending side to start out. The protocol can push to 80% LTV in line with the FannieMae guidelines and some loans are towards that end. There\u2019s a ton of pent up demand for people to unlock equity in their homes this year that we\u2019re seeing and home values are up across the board. Some of the loans are second liens at higher rates. Most are first liens. None of these are bridge loans, hard money loans or other creative instruments. They are all long term loans underwritten to Fannie guidelines just like 99% of homeowners use to buy a house,   These are all freshly originated loans wholly owned by bHOME holders through the protocol.   LoanSnap is not driving the profit here making choices about what to include or not. FannieMae sets the standard terms and underwriting. The protocol (bHOME holders) purchase the loan through the logic in the smart contracts. Any originator can come and sell loans to the protocol once vetted and approved by the DAO. Mortgages are in a unique place in the ecosystem and the protocol has been through a lot of legal review by former SEC lawyers.   Two reasons: First, adding mortgages to MakerDAO as a key RWA that underpins a large part of the US financial system for years will help DAI to add scale and stability of MakerDAO. Second, it will add a key crypto-native asset to the Bacon Protocol so it can lend against more homes and get the crypto community more familiar and comfortable with an asset that\u2019s not been on chain before.   We\u2019ve been talking with various people at MakerDAO and in the RWA group about it off and on for two years and it\u2019s always been clear there\u2019s a huge benefit to both groups and it\u2019s been a matter of getting the pieces in place on both sides.

There is a guide to help collateral applicants move through the process. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions when you take a look at it. When onboarding collateral, the process is best started with a MIP6. One post which is good to read are the Guidelines for Onboarding. This allows the collateral applicant to self assess on if your collateral would be a good candidate for Maker. Right now, this doesn\u2019t appear to be the case and we would be unable to prioritize your collateral at this time. Also, I would highly encourage you to talk first about the actual collateral you would like to onboard and the business opportunity and investment with the Maker protocol. I see many questions replying to your post that are focused on that. The questions in the MIP6 application template will help guide you in this process. D3M is a collateral technology that is undergoing an evolution and it\u2019s unknown at this time whether it would be a fit for your collateral. It\u2019s best not to focus on a specific technology as the basis of a collateral application. The business opportunity is what is important early in the collateral onboarding process. ",

As far as yield farms and liquidity are concerned, the agency RMBS market is the safest and highly liquid. This could also unlock trillions of dollars in liquidity trapped in the form of home equity thereby increasing the velocity of money and benefitting everyone in the process. Bacon\u2019s fundamental value proposition is the disintermediation of mortgage loan origination by leveraging its relationship with LoanSnap to scale the onboarding of mortgage-backed NFTs. Imagine that you are a mortgage loan originator, why would you go the TradFi route that takes weeks to close whereas the DeFi route takes hours? Also, they have changed their bHome to a 1:1 pegged stablecoin. This can also be onboarded as an RWA once there is sufficient supply/demand. ",

If that happens, we\u2019ll be back where we started as I will request the same information from you. This is why following the collateral onboarding process is the quickest way to determine, for both the collateral applicant and Maker, if a collateral is appropriate and makes sense to onboard. The longer we wait to get the necessary information, the more time we both spend on this and it typically leads to frustration on one or both sides. The process is designed to minimize this. Start with the Guidelines for onboarding. If it\u2019s not clear that these parameters can be met, it\u2019s best to wait until you can. Otherwise, it will be the first thing the collateral stakeholders will look at if the onchain poll passes and if it\u2019s not clear to us, we\u2019ll inform you that we are unable to prioritize your collateral at this time. We don\u2019t need to run through the entire process to determine this and it can be done by the collateral applicant. Part of the Collateral Engineering Service\u2019s role is to help educate applicants on the process the collateral stakeholders follow. While there are other ways to engage with the community (like the Signal Request), these just extend the timeframe. The onboarding process is design to reduce the work on both sides. Keep in mind, there needs to be a clear business case for Maker to onboard collateral. The guidelines and collateral application template help us understand that. Let me know if you have any questions. There are a lot of details in the process and we can help you understand them. ",

                    "content": "Yesterday\u2019s explanation of D3M risks was illuminating, for sure. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m staying with yes: 1.) The SR doesn\u2019t specify the desired Debt Ceiling, so Maker Governance can choose how much of this D3M it wants to onboard. If the total D3M risk is deemed too high, I\u2019d love to see it reduced elsewhere. Aave seemed of particular concern, given the recent UST and ChainLink debacle. 2.) MKR circulating market capitalization is $1,38bn today. If we take that as a measure of the size of the operation, I believe Maker should focus on growth, and aggressively so. Growth means opening new lines of business, which entails taking on additional risk. Should this risk be mitigated? Yes, definitely so. Yesterday\u2019s call surfaced a couple of good ways to do so. For instance: collateralization of D3M lines or insurances. 3.) We have seen competition from FRAX, Cytus, and others make massive progress in RWA, even though Maker probably has the best process and clearest thinking in that space. Real-world exposure and integration will drive the whole space forward, in my opinion. Why should anyone care about a blockchain native token, when there are so precious little uses outside of a tiny bubble. I talked to John Nahas of Avalanche last week, and he said something that really stuck with me: \"The blockchain space is fighting about crumbs when the kitchen is right next door!\" We need to open that door, and we shouldn\u2019t be too picky about where the door handle is. I deeply appreciate Maker\u2019s concern with risk and making the best possible stablecoin. But it needs to find ways to grow aggressively. So either Maker spins out MetaDAOs that can run experiments and fail without damage to the mothership, or it experiments itself and mitigates risk along the way. Not experimenting is not a viable option in my mind. The signal request is turning out No, as it stands. So my points may be mute. I hope they make sense, though. Now, about that Igloo\u2026 ",

Is the Bacon protocol not seasoned enough or is the LoanSnap strategic partnership not seen as good enough underwriters for some reason? Since you were vague about it I can only surmise that it is something specific to the D3M and not the collateral per see. If so, would people prefer to see Bacon onboard via another route like the Tinlake indenture trust approach or the 6S Capital approach?

It\u2019s an interesting topic since I\u2019ve dealt with this my entire career in product development. I like to look at this as architectural runway or innovation work as it relates to engineering. Most engineering teams run in some sort of iterative fashion. CES has a two week sprint cycle. When we plan the work for a sprint, we pull in the most valuable collateral work for the protocol based upon community and stakeholder feedback. This is the collateral work that enables us to pay the bills and \u201ckeep the lights on.\u201d We also look at the architecture or innovation work and see if it makes sense to pull any of that in for the current sprint. Right now, we have four D3M scenarios (Aave, Compound, Maple, TrueFi), each with a different set of parameters we are investigating. I realize Aave is onboarded but we\u2019ve learned some things so we need to factor that into the other three collaterals using the D3M technology. In addition, we have the institutional vault work with Antalpha. That will be the first one we attempt to onboard. I\u2019m sharing all this as an instructive example and to talk about relative priorities. Finite resources are a constant so it\u2019s imperative we only work on the highest value and/or strategic collateral. Not only do we have CES but the Risk, Oracles, Protocol Engineering, Legal, and RWF core units involved with collateral onboarding. When we experiment, we could be taking time from one or more of these core units so we need to be clear on the business opportunity and understand the alignment to strategic objectives. Notice I said nothing about technology.  As it relates to this SR, @ejbarraza my suggestion is to ideate with the community and develop the business opportunity so you can help us understand specifically how it will meet and exceed the Guidelines for Onboarding (we are looking for growth). We\u2019re all super busy so the more complete something is the quicker Maker can decide if it\u2019s something we want to invest in. As a side note, we have an entire core unit, Growth, dedicated to business development and they could give you some constructive feedback on your project. Their public channel is on the MakerDAO Discord server. Once the opportunity development is complete then consider posting a MIP6 on the forum. I appreciate your excitement in working with Maker and like what you are trying to offer. If you have any questions on the collateral onboarding process, we are happy to help answer questions. ",
