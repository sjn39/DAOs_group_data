One inclusion poll that you will be ask to select is whether to approve the Strategic Marcomms Core Unit, or not. Marketing Distribution. When you vote\u2014I ask that you think about one of the keys to success: Distribution, Distribution, Distribution. Products that achieve greatness get this one thing right. Value Proposition. We All know that the BD team has had tremendous distribution success and they have brought value to the South American market with DAI. Now ask yourself a question, what is it about DAI that will cause people in ASIA to spread the word about our product? We have yet to nail this mechanism of vitality in this region. Market effects theory. Creating a mechanism for network effects in Asia and other continents is not an easy task. Sure, we all want to build and create DAI as the next big thing\u2014and the easiest thing we can say is, \u201cif we build it, they will come.\u201d The biggest mistake we can do is not having an original approach in our distribution hacks. We need to get more creative and at the same time be aware that we need to create a value proposition for DAI Distribution. \u201cA good product with great distribution, with always beat a GREAT product with poor distribution\u201d \u2013Reid Hoffman \u201cNever treat distribution like an afterthought. If you can\u2019t get your product that want to use on a startup budget, then ultimately you\u2019re doom.\u201d With that in mind I urge the Maker Community to Vote YES to the Strategic Marcomms inclusion poll based on their experience, commitment, and what I believe is a passion for bringing growth to the Maker ecosystem. I urge you to ponder the question as to why a former Team of talented Foundation Employees is asking for a budget with flair, and a budget that brings an appetite for taking DAI to the next level? I also ask that at this very moment that you measure their success by future results and not by past performance. We need to measure the success of certain Core Unit by what they will deliver, and not what they have written, including\u2014but not limited to the success of DAI in Asia\u2014a continent we have yet to successfully triumph in. Here are more details to their approach. If you truly believe that Maker and DAI are household names and every person in your neighborhood knows Maker and DAI, inside and out\u2014then by all means, vote \u201cNO\u201d. But if you are like me, and know that DAI needs more Marketing and more adoption, than do as I will do and Vote YES. Do not let the opposition sway you in a direction/narrative that they personally want and are also not satisfied with. Think for yourself. Do not let them influence the MakerDAO process. ",
