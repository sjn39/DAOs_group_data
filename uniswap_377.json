I\u2019ll gladly ass kiss, and I believe that, once everything is finished up on their end [of v3], people will understand more shortly. With respect to the token: Instead of bootstrapping garbage to a nothing-product with incentive rewards for liquidity of said garbage, we get representation for a network that has/will/is:   begin distribution for liquidity on the network pair - ethereum | US tokens+BTC token - not a food token. As I\u2019ve followed the project for years now, I\u2019ve already known this, but this is HUGE in showing the community that they actually care about the network and health of ethereum. Proper liquidity to the network token that started it all is a noble choice!   this is the forefront of AMMs, and has been for years, standing the test of time extraordinarily successfully, while being one of, if not the, only reliable source of decentralized institutional level liquidity on such an enormous quantity of pairs.   with upcoming features, the badassery of this token will only continue to grow, not just from a protocol perspective, but meaningful governance as well; this is one of those projects that governance can entirely make or break the future.   with reference to the lockup, even after complete distribution, many tokens will be used for funding the network growth and prosperity, and with v3 around the corner, people will begin to realize the incredible amount of work goes into a proper amm, as the next generation AMM, Uniswap will have zero competition in terms of limitless possibilities.   balancing, balancing, balancing: >60% to the community out of the box, with the team holding more than investors. Lockup. Treasury. Yes, the community of AMMs is largely dominated by larger, more involved users and MM/AMMs - they\u2019re the ones who have been providing liquidity for years. I don\u2019t see the issue - if you do, feel free to get out there and provide more liquidity. Only 150 million have been distributed, so get your share of the next four years!   one of the final steps for v3 - when all said and done, I truly believe that this will be one of the few assets on the minds of farmers. This isn\u2019t a fork, and this isn\u2019t a stagnant protocol. The devs have been kicking ass, despite what I\u2019d imagine is frustrating. Cheap imitations have hurt the network, and watching them be rewarded with millions is, I\u2019d imagine, not a good feeling. Despite this, what comes next is going to blow some uniSOCKS off.   in it of itself a direct liquidity pullback from sushi. I\u2019m not even sure the liquidity sapped from sushi is on sushi; I\u2019m sure almeda throws it right back into uniAMM / cex algos. Even then, prior to sushi to now, the data tells that uniswap hasn\u2019t suffered from liquidity lost, simply users who previously didn\u2019t participate in liquidity strategies swelled. Regardless, this is definitely going to turn some heads.   Obligatory this was not a paid advertisement. ",
