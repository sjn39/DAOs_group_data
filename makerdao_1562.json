(Feel free to respond on Discord if you prefer that over forum)   No, it\u2019s all good\u2013the Video was Edited, so it\u2019s hard to remember word for word what I heard live, to what has been released. But, also I\u2019ll be Monday Morning Quaterbacking it, just like you and Rune pointed out stuff that the DAO couldn\u2019t avoid (like CU contingency budgeting) in the early days. I\u2019m sure we can agree that Building a DAO is an opaque goal. I also shouldn\u2019t expect someone who has not been in the grind day in day out to know the sentiment of the community. Perhaps similar to me joining the Lido/Flashbots communities once a week (as an example),  and trying to represent the community\u2019s diverse sentiment. As an example at 11:30 of the recording you mention that MakerDAO is a BANK. I can tell you many community members (pretty sure it will be over 51%) don\u2019t ever want MakerDAO to be reference as a \u201cBank.\u201d In fact some cringe at the sound of Maker being labelled as a \u201cbank.\u201d But again, all good\u2013its a matter of opinions. You also mentioned that DAI should be backed by only Liquid Collateral Types like RWAs. You and I both know that most RWAs are liquid as a Brick  \u2013 hard to dispose. But okay\u2026 Tomato, Tomatoe. There was a moment that was edited out, where I can tell your knowledge of the inner workings of the Maker\u2019s core component ( Vat) is lacking. But that\u2019s to be expected as I myself lack the knowledge that a Maker OG might possess. And I\u2019m pretty sure when it comes to Flashbots you can round circles around me. Again, all good\u2013we live in the same building, but have different views. ",
