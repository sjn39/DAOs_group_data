Pros:  Rewards voters for safeguarding the system Discourages free riders Creates an opportunity cost for MKR outside the Chief which will create pressure on holders to lock up MKR and actually participate in governance.  Cons:  More MKR means more sell pressure (?) Changes the social contract of what MKR \u201cis\u201d  Consideration: Should MKR need to be actively voting for an executive to be eligible or just locked or staked in the contract? Adding a timelock to MKR in the DSChief Pros:  In tandem with other features, can be an important part of aligning incentives for voters.  Cons:  May introduce unforeseen risks in needing to withdraw MKR quickly  Adding a voting multiplier for MKR locked in the DSChief Pros:  Either in tandem with vote lock or by holding tokens longer, incentivizes MKR participation and lockup.  Cons:  Amplifies \u201cwhale power\u201d which may or may not be a bad thing.  Hope to hear your opinions and more pros and cons on these subjects. Look forward to more discussion! ",

The 21 million BTC hard cap is a large portion of what drives value to bitcoin.  The MKR narrative, in my opinion, was one million MKR unless something goes wrong.

As per the model it\u2019s up for debate, should rewards have a vesting period? should we have a fixed amount of mkr subject to rewards as a top limit? should we have a minimum amount of lockup time required? should we implement quadratic voting and directly pay the rewards through a vesting period using that indicator? Additionally besides vesting periods and so on we have to factor in if it\u2019s appealing for the investor too, in other words, we can have a vesting period of 4 years but that does not mean investors/governance actors would be keen to the idea.

This means:  Less MKR burnt, but still some are burnt (e.g., 50%). more MKR given to active voters.  Regarding:     Aaron_Bartsch:  Adding a timelock to MKR in the DSChief   I am not sure about this. It might have implications hard to evaluate at the moment. So I abstain for now. But, the third point:     Aaron_Bartsch:  Adding a voting multiplier for MKR locked in the DSChief   I totally agree! It seems just a very good idea. It also prevents attacks using flash-loans and this type of things. My vision: these ideas, if implemented and put in place, will drive an healthy tokenomics. People who don\u2019t have the time to vote will delegate (in exchange for some money, of course) their MKR to the people who have more time to vote and participate actively. EDIT: of course delegation is not available now, but is coming with the new governance smart contracts which are being developed as we speak. ",

It just creates a different incentive structure and profit-seeking actors will adapt around that, but since it doesn\u2019t really force active participation in governance those actors won\u2019t optimize for that. They\u2019ll optimize for their immediate returns. Another way to say that is: you can\u2019t directly reward good participation in governance (which will be gamed), you can only tie reward to governance results. That\u2019s the basic incentive system already in place: MKR holders should want good governance because MKR price reflects what the market thinks of their governance. I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t have a solution for making that system work better \u2013 my hope is that with scale the market will more correctly price MKR (not a comment on whether current market valuation is too high or too low, but it doesn\u2019t feel very connected to the internals of what\u2019s going on in MakerDAO). But I don\u2019t think adding reward schemes for perfunctory governance participation will truly help us\u2026 except maybe if we create a strong delegation culture among MKR holders. Delegates would not be apathetic and receive a fraction of the voting incentive in exchange for keeping the MKR active? Sorry, that comment ended up being just rambling. ",

Perhaps this, at the end imo cash flow is what sustains valuations, it will again imo inevitability move (eventually) towards that direction, specially if you can\u2019t monetize the participation since we do not accept it as collateral & using it as collateral in secondary lending platforms has been proven to be problematic (even though anyone should use it as they see fit). Having a cash return on the investment also decreases the sell pressure and avoids the buy to appreciate and sell scheme. A strong price eventually will be needed to help safeguard the protocol as new collaterals are onboarded and dai outstanding keeps increasing. Perhaps it\u2019s not needed and pure governance decisions will sustain valuations and we will never need to have rewards which is great but I\u2019m kind of skeptic on the idea. ",

Should we maybe separate:  protecting the hat  active voting  Aave is giving .56% APY (last time I checked). I think that having a <1% inflation on MKR to reward those who lock MKR in Maker is acceptable. Not sure if that would be enough to nudge enough people. My guess is it is. This solution would be to protect the hat. Any solution to encourage voting is much more complex, so I\u2019ll refrain from trying to addressing it here. ",

                    "content": "    Aaron_Bartsch:  Adding inflation incentives for MKR in the DSChief contract.   Provided this MKR comes as some % from surplus I agree.    I also would make one suggestion.    The payout is calculated via the following formula. MKRreward = MKRstake_reward x GP  where GP is defined as Governance Participation VOTES_CAST/VOTES_POSSIBLE.  0<=GP<=1.     Aaron_Bartsch:  Adding a timelock to MKR in the DSChief   I suggest simply a MKR seasoning period before it can be deposited into either the ES module or DSSChief.   This way MKR has to wait the seasoning period before it can even deposit into DSSChief and isn\u2019t locked for withdrawal at all.   The time penalty is up front - not via a locking mechanic.     MKR seasoning proposal for system control access       Greetings Maker community.  There is a lot going on and my apologies to add but I wanted to get this idea off my plate for risk-governance consideration as well as community consideration.  There has been a lot of discussion about attack vectors in the Maker system.  I have in my own analysis identified two primary attack vectors that I outline quickly below.    General governance attack via obtaining sufficient MKR.   The first line of defense for the MCD here that has been recently enacted is \u2026         Aaron_Bartsch:  Adding a voting multiplier for MKR locked in the DSChief   I am mixed on this suggestion.  I do believe an important voting metric I would like to see is MKR*YRS voting as well as MKR voting.   I would say that if we use a voting multiplier have it be a function that starts at say .1 and rises to and NEVER exceeds 1 over some time period (say 6 months). ",

This doesn\u2019t seem to be a foregone conclusion as best as I can tell. Instead of redirecting MKR destined for the furnace to some governance incentive contract you could just as well redirect dai destined to be sold by the flapper. It still ends up being taken as a % of revenue and probably is even lower cost bc you avoid slippage incurred in the MKR purchase. ",
