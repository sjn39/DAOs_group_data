Paragraph Summary MIP39c2-SP36 adds Core Unit SF-001: Strategic Finance Core Unit. Its mission is to provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.  Specification  Motivation The Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate is modified as a part of the Endgame Plan Approval MIP Set in order to eliminate any possible risk of the collateral onboarding process becoming disrupted or blocked by the removal of the old MIP6 process. The updated mandate is written with a new approach where the critical element of the mandate that explicitly and directly impacts Facilitator Governance Powers are provided up front. This information is also described as short and succinct as possible in order to make it completely clear what Governance Privileges the Core Unit Facilitator will have with regards to proposing non-standard weekly polls as defined in MIP16.  Core Unit ID SF-001  Core Unit Name Strategic Finance  Core Unit Facilitator Mark Phillips (@Aes)  Core Unit Mandate  Mandate as it relates to Facilitator Governance Powers The Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate makes the Strategic Finance Core Unit Facilitator also able to unilaterally, and with no additional process, propose non-standard weekly polls and Executive Votes related to:  RWA Collateral management Risk parameter changes for RWA Collateral Other Risk Parameters in the Maker Protocol RWA collateral onboarding RWA Collateral offboarding Other votes and governance actions related to risk, Dai collateral, and risk parameters Any other votes and governance actions related to content described in the Informational Mandate below   Informational Mandate This section contains additional in depth information about the Strategic Finance Core Unit Mandate  Mission Provide financial reporting and analysis to assist the DAO in evaluating the financial health of the protocol to enable strategic decision making and allocate capital more effectively.  Vision Our vision is to provide the most accurate and clear financial reporting across the entire crypto industry, leveraging the transparency and immutability of the public blockchain to ultimately provide financials data that exceeds the requirements of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). Additionally, we seek to provide the DAO and MakerDAO stakeholders with relevant financial information to help assess the health of the protocol. We will accomplish this by:  Providing clear, easily digestible financial information to the DAO that enables stakeholders to make informed decisions for the protocol Building financial dashboards and tools that provide real-time financial data directly from the blockchain so stakeholders can understand the health of the protocol Partnering with SES Core Unit to implement standardized and automated expense reporting vs budgets Collaborating with Growth and Risk Core Units to provide financial analysis of prospective deals Working with the Protocol Engineering and Oracle Core Units to model growth opportunities and risks Asset-liability management and innovation through investing protocol assets to generate yield (real-world assets, DeFi, etc.) Facilitating recurring strategic reviews to set a strategic action plan Accounting, solvency, liquidity, and potential regulatory reporting   Strategy & Current Work SF encompasses the traditional finance functions, including financial reporting, planning, analysis, and accounting, as well as an advisory component that helps facilitate consensus around the DAO\u2019s strategic priorities. This work, as detailed below and in the \u2018RWF Efforts\u2019 section, will be continued with the approval of the SF Core Unit. This work includes but is not limited to:  Publishing Monthly Financial Statements Posting Monthly Financial Reports Reporting Actual Monthly Expenses & Forecasting by Core Unit Partnering with GRO-001 Facilitator and RISK-001 Facilitators to negotiate terms for the Nexo Institutional Vault as well as another 600M+ undisclosed prospective IV customer Maintenance of the Real-Time Financial Dashboard Forecasting Revenue and Profitability Analyzing Profitability by Vault Building new SQL queries to support the Strategic Focus Areas for the Recurring Strategy Reviews and KPIs  Our approach to working with the DAO is focused on collaboration. We believe partnering with the other Core Units and MKR holders, with each bringing our strengths and expertise to the table will yield multiplicative benefits compared to working purely in silos. This does not mean the Core Unit is dependent on other Core Units to execute the current work and envisioned scope; only that results will be maximized through collaboration. This collaboration is already happening today and will only get better moving forward.  Roadmap SF-001 will initially focus on continuing to build a solid financial reporting foundation and continue its work on the RWF FP&A roadmap, prioritizing work based on community feedback. The current roadmap includes:  Create a Strategic Action Plan (STRAP) to develop plans to achieve DAO-wide long-term goals by facilitating:  Determining the protocol\u2019s strategic position Prioritization of Objectives Developing & formalizing the strategic plan The assessment of executing the plan The review and revision of the plan as necessary   Facilitate recurring Strategy reviews to:  Assess how CUs are executing the mission and agreed-upon strategy Understand issues and obstacles the DAO needs to address Discuss new opportunities that have arisen that the DAO may want to pursue Decide if adjustments to the plan are needed Facilitate optimal capital allocation   Partnering with SES Core Unit to standardize and automate expense reporting across the DAO  Increase transparency and reporting standards to provide more accountability to CU spend   Build out \u2018Governance Relations\u2019 by partnering with Core Unit leadership to frame and communicate MakerDAO\u2019s strategy, operations & financial results to the community Asset-Liability Management:  Reporting of the current and future balance sheet structure in terms of interest rate, duration, maturity and profitability Researching and proposing ways to optimize the balance sheet allocation Providing insights into borrower risks and analyzing customer capital flows   Financial Reporting & Planning  Monthly Financial Reports Monthly Expense Reports Monthly Revenue & Expense Forecasts Budgeting support through building Budget Templates and providing expense analysis to CUs   KPI dashboard  Building real-time dashboards leveraging on-chain data to measure DAO-approved Strategic Focus Areas and Key Performance Indicators   Real-time Vault Profitability Analysis   Community Involvement  Educate community members in understanding the protocol, its economics, and risk aspects Develop models for community members Review community proposals Provide feedback on business decisions   Team Structure The full team and current budget will be composed of 4 permanent members:  1 Finance & Strategy Facilitator - @Aes  1 Title TBD - @SebVentures  1 Senior Finance Manager 1 Senior Data Analyst  Long-term, we will expand the team to 7 permanent members to include:  1 Senior Financial Analyst 1 Accounting Manager 1 DAO Auditor   RWF Efforts As part of RWF-001, the team has already delivered a number of reports, models, and financial analyses, including:  Monthly Financial Reports Monthly Financial Statements Real Time Financial Dashboard MakerDAO Expense Reporting MKR Compensation Model A Framework for Valuing MKR Institutional Vault Financial Analysis Budget Simulator with Revenue & Cash Flow Forecast Key Performance Indicator Discussion   Proposals and Funnel (pipeline) Management Strategic Finance Core Unit will evaluate the current off-chain and on-chain (ETH/ETH-derived, D3Ms, PSMs and assets with revenue potential above 1 million per year) ecosystem to propose to onboard or offboard assets into or out of the Maker Ecosystem, based on the current and sought risk for Maker as a whole. Strategic Finance Core Unit will have discretion in managing the pipeline in terms of prioritization and resources dedicated to the aforementioned process.  Domain Evolution The Strategic Finance Core Unit aims to build a solid financial foundation for the DAO that enables the creation and growth of other specialized financial Core Units with expertise in diverse areas of finance. Some examples include Corp Dev (M&A), Asset-Liability Management, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Governance Relations.
