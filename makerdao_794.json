                    "content": " Summary On February 11th 2022 DUX team received a report from the Immunefi Core Unit which disclosed a vulnerability on the Governance Portal. The vulnerability was classified as \u2018Medium\u2019 severity. DUX team patched the vulnerability and deployed a hotfix. A bug bounty payout of 2500 DAI was approved by DUX team to the whitehat hacker. According to our knowledge no users were ever affected by the vulnerability.  Background On February 10th 2022 at 8:21pm UTC a report from a whitehat hacker (smsecurity) was submitted to the Immunefi bug bounty platform, on a vulnerability affecting the Governance Portal. The report went through review and triaging by the Immunefi team before it was escalated to the DUX Core Unit one day later, on February 11th. Immunefi classified the bug report as \u2018Medium\u2019 severity. DUX team reviewed the bug report, confirmed the validity and classification of the report, and patched the vulnerability. A bug bounty of 2500 DAI was granted to the whitehat hacker and is currently pending payout.  Detailed Analysis The vulnerability was related to our use of Swagger UI\u2014a tool we use in the Governance Portal codebase to automatically generate (visual) documentation for our API, making it easier for third parties to interact with it. The whitehat discovered that a known XSS vulnerability of Swagger was still present on the Governance Portal\u2019s \u2018api-docs\u2019 page, and was exploitable through using custom URL parameters. The Swagger API endpoints of the Governance Portal would accept query parameters in the URL\u2014in this case the whitehat hacker used ?url=https://attacker-controlled-swagger in their Proof-of-Concept. In theory, through using custom query parameters, an attacker would be able to phish users with a constructed URL and redirect them to a malicious website or their own API endpoint.  Mitigation Steps The whitehat hacker collaborated by suggesting a fix for the vulnerability through 1) slashing the query parameters from the URL and 2) adding middleware for the defence in depth. Based on the report and based on further investigation DUX team patched the vulnerability through the aforementioned changes. A hotfix was deployed outside of our usual biweekly release cadence to fix the vulnerability. Upon further investigation DUX team concluded that the vulnerability was not present on other pages and/or components of the Governance Portal. ",
