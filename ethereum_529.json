The conclusion I made from this was that it\u2019s critical for Ethereum\u2019s success to have a governance process that\u2019s seen as politically legitimate and can make recommendations well before the need to rely on a fork to make the decision for us. It\u2019s impossible to make everyone happy, but what would be great to see is something that we can point to when some issue is dragged up and can say (with support from most people) \u201clook, people had their say on this\u201d. To me, political legitimacy boils down to identifying key stakeholder groups and querying them individually on matters. The groups as I can see them, and suggestions for how they might weight their votes, might be:  ETH holders (coin vote) Projects (weighted by token market share?) Core developers/devs (weighted by commits? or just 1:1 i\u2019m sure they can work something out) Users, community members (weighted 1:1 using a system with some anti-sybil property like r/recdao?) Miners/validators EEA members  We don\u2019t need to have a formal, on-chain process, but improving an informal one could be a boost for the community. It would be great to be able to make decisions in a more expeditious and resolute way. ",

                    "content": "TL;DR: You can\u2019t stop forks.  If there is a disenfranchised group out there, they will fork (see ETC).  Voting doesn\u2019t change that. I disagree with @alexvandesande on this topic because I think the only thing that makes crypto-currency governance better than traditional governance systems (e.g., democracy, monarchy, dictatorships, etc.) is the fact that groups of people can split off into separate groups if their belief systems diverge enough.  Democracy, monarchy, and even dictatorships would not be that bad if it was reasonably easy for disenfranchised citizens to \u201cfork\u201d (secede).  As has recently been seen in Catalonia, and historically all over the world, splitting off when a subgroup becomes disenfranchised is extremely difficult, expensive, and bloody. IMO, this is exactly why the governance system of Ethereum ultimately boils down to \u201cusers decide what client they want to run\u201d.  This is similar to groups of citizens (e.g., cities) being able to decide \u201cwhich government do I want ruling me\u201d and \u201ca new one that we made up\u201d is a reasonable choice. Alex is correct that there are network effect costs to splitting like this, but that is OK.  Having one network to rule them all is a bad thing it turns out.  It is why most Americans feel disenfranchised, because there is one government trying to pander to vastly different groups of people.  Sure, something like Maker or Augur will need to either pick a chain or run their platform on multiple chains (splitting their user base) or spend significant engineering figuring out how to merge the chains, but that is well worth it IMO if it means that disenfranchised users feel empowered to split off. One can, of course, argue that doing things like voting prior to implementing something that is likely to cause a split could result in the split not happening at all because the client development teams would (presumably) not write the code in the first place, but that just means you are disenfranchising a different set of people.  So you haven\u2019t really \u201csolved forking\u201d, you have just made it so the set of people most capable of winning votes are the set of people who aren\u2019t disenfranchised and the set of people who aren\u2019t becoming disenfranchised. Ultimately, what we must remember is that the client development teams are not beholden to anyone other then their own corporate structures and they can author whatever code they want, regardless of any sort of voting system.  If you try to tell them, \u201cYou aren\u2019t allowed to write this code\u201d they will just do it anyway and your governance system will be shown to be pointless in the end. ",

As you say, this isn\u2019t a geographic region. They are free to make their own modifications and pursue a fork.

The client developers are the ones making this decision because they are the ones who are putting in the time/resources (they aren\u2019t being paid by ETH holders, they are self funded in various ways).  The EIP process is an input into the client developer engineering process that attempts to allow people who aren\u2019t client engineers to contribute ideas to what could be engineered.  The All Core Dev meeting exists not because it needs to, but because the various client developers would rather be inter-operable so they meet to try to agree among each other what will go into each client.  I think ultimately, the problem I have with voting is that I have witnessed what happens to voting based governance systems.  They ultimately end up being compromised by those who are good at pandering and marketing or they end up being driven by people who don\u2019t fully understand the issues being voted on.  With the \u201cclient developers\u201d make decisions but can be ignored by users, it allows people who are spending a lot of time thinking about these problems (40-100 hours a week) to make decisions while keeping them in check by making it easy for the community to simply ignore the proposed changes (which results in the client developers having wasted a lot of time).

So here\u2019s my suggestion on how to attempt solve governance, 960 and 999 at the same time:  When we switch to PoS, we should instead of cutting down the extra issuance, instead give it (maybe less than current) to a contract that will fund public goods. The governance of that contract is open to debate, maybe it can be a complex multiple stakeholder vote, or could be some sort of futarchy or another crazy idea. The contract would once per year decide on how it could distribute funds the next year, towards all sorts of public goods including:  Fund open source development Fund insurance pools Redress and reimburse victims of hacks, bugs and other kinds of loss (this could include things like the Parity Multisig case - and could even apply retroactively to the web3 foundation) Burn ether to reduce the cap, if the governance decides it\u2019s the best usage    Of course the really tricky part is of course, how that governance would happen. But I think this would allow to keep many parties happy: it creates a structured format to redress grievances and take actions for damaged parties that doesn\u2019t have a fork, limits the power of governance (it cannot freeze or interfere in other contracts, can only distribute X amounts of ether per year), etc. My suggestion for a governance model would be to be a simple multisig, but instead of having private keys on the multisig, each \u201cchair\u201d would be a different contract, that would represent stakeholders (so validators could vote on with their stake power, maybe users would have a different sort of contract, etc) ",

Even if we did a coinvote, I\u2019m not confident that we would have enough information to assert this.  During the ETH/ETC split, I was strongly in favor of not recovering the funds (ETC), however in the end I went with ETH because I didn\u2019t care enough to lose the network effect benefits of ETH.  In any vote I would have voted ETC, yet when it came time to choose between breaking away from existing leadership and finding new leadership, I chose to follow the existing leadership.  Note: During the ETH/ETC debate I was reasonably vocal about my position as well. Now, a couple years later and after having quit my job and worked in this ecosystem for a year, I am better able to appreciate the decision that was made by the leadership.  I still am not 100% in favor of the decision, but I\u2019m glad I chose to follow-the-leadership (whom I generally trust to try to do the right thing at this point) rather than break off and try to form my own community or help build a new community. The point I\u2019m getting at here is that we cannot assume that just because someone shouts and yells or even votes for a particular outcome that they are willing to sacrifice the benefits of network effects for their belief system.  We also can\u2019t assume that everyone is fully informed as to the nuance of the various arguments being made for or against the things being voted on, just as I wasn\u2019t during the ETH/ETC split (I was working a full time job at the time, Ethereum was only my hobby back then). As to the question whether or not there will be a fork or not if this happens, I don\u2019t know.  However, if there is it is because there are enough people who really do care about the topic on both sides to be willing to split over the decision.  That alone IMO means that splitting is the right thing to do.   It would be interesting to run a blockchain where the client(s) were incredibly modular and the client development team was structured such that anyone could fund the development of any feature and the system always forked and users had to actively choose which chain to use.  Then if any feature had a non-trivial number of people that cared more about the feature than the network effects, there would be a lasting fork, and if not then one side would lose and the other would win.
