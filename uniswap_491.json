Here is the initial governance post from monet-supply: [Discussion] Uniswap Liquidity Incentive Plan Here is where we started discussing the following proposal, with lots of positive feedbacks: [Discussion] Uniswap Liquidity Incentive Plan Instead of incentivizing several pairs of ETH/stablecoin, I propose to reduce the scope to one single pair. This pair won\u2019t be ETH/DAI, ETH/USDC, nor ETH/USDT. This pair would be mUSD / ETH. Why ? mUSD is a meta stablecoin with a lot of cool features built by our friends from mStable (https://mstable.org/):  mUSD is backed by a basket of whitelisted stablecoins (USDC, TUSD, USDT\u2026), You can redeem at any time the constituents of the basket, You can also leverage the swap feature between any stablecoin of the basket to provide end users with 0 slippage between USDC and USDT, for instance.  What are the benefits?   Drastically increase the liquidity to hop in and out of speculative assets in Uniswap, instead of splitting the liquidity into 3 stablecoin pools: DAI & USDC & USDT Get access to a meta stablecoin, thus reducing the risk of unpeg  Leverage 0 slippage swaps between all these stablecoins,  Here is the snapshot page    snapshot.page    Snapshot      ",

The constant sum market maker formula can result in certain stablecoins being out of stock, and mStable is voting to remove DAI from the pool, leaving only centralized stablecoins. Curve pools might be a better option as they never run out of liquidity and include more constituents. More generally, I don\u2019t see the advantage of a single stablecoin pool if it just pushes users towards other exchanges (mStable / Curve) or aggregators that can handle the wrapping/unwrapping natively. In addition to raising gas costs for small trades, I\u2019m afraid it would commodify Uniswap\u2019s liquidity and let other platforms own the customer experience. ",

Regarding the other point related to User experience, I don\u2019t see why leveraging mUSD (mStable product) is different from using wBTC (Bitgo product), DAI (Maker product), USDT (Theter product)\u2026 DeFi is about composability and being able to benefit from other projects\u2019 innovations, especially when they build great products. As explained in the proposal, I think that incentivizing a pool with mUSD comes with a lot more benefits  (including decentralization) for Uniswap\u2019s users than incentivizing a simple USDT pool.
