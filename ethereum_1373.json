We came up with a new solution for it.  PoC We forked MetaMask and created a PoC for QR code signing between our hardware wallet Keystone and the browser extension.  Motivation  USB connectivity could break from time to time. QR code causes much less compatibility issues. Much better experience not only for users but also for developers. With QR code, users can easily turn their old mobile phone into a offline signing device turning on airplane mode with app like Airgap. (Note: another great QR based hww is Ngrave and they share the same opinion with us.) With big screen & ABI encoding, complex DeFi transactions can be fully verified on the cold signer (hardware wallet) otherwise the user is blindly trusting the software wallet which can be compromised much more easily compared to the cold signer (hardware wallet). GridPlus is fixing this vulnerability too and they are awesome.   Importance of Composable Wallets Personally I really agree with Andrew Hong\u2019s view about wallets.  Cold signer (hardware wallet) should be specialized on \u201cSecurity Layer\u201d in the ecosystem. Cold signer (hardware wallet) should be as compatible as possible with other software wallets.  ABI encoding is an essential part for cold signer (hardware wallet).   Next Steps  We are talking with MetaMask, xDeFi and GasNow for integration. We will raise an EIP for the standard of QR code protocol between cold signer (hardware wallet) and software wallet. More details will be posted within this week or next. Adding more ABIs to our product (firmware update is needed).  Please throw me any questions/concerns you have. All ears here  ",

IMO, the QR flow is interesting and maybe easier for some users than connecting over USB, but it doesn\u2019t solve what happened to the Nexus Mutual founder. What does solve that is supporting ABIs in hardware wallets. I\u2019m curious how you guys go about adding ABIs? Does your team review ABIs for popular applications and then bundle them with your firmware? Do you allow your users to use their own ABIs?

To solve the Nexus Mutual founder\u2019s problem, these are needed:  Big screen for easily verifying complex DeFi transactions. Embed ABIs into hardware wallet  And yes we are working on this. From the video in the tweet you can see we embedded the ABI of Uniswap V2 and shows the details of the unsigned swap transactions.

And we are adding more. Do you allow your users to use their own ABIs? This is doable and we are researching for a proper solution for it. It needs some time because this may involve some security issues. Why don\u2019t other hardware wallets have this functionality? Just my 2 gwei -  Most hwws are \u201cstateless\u201d design. They minimize what to store on the device. This design is kind of out-dated as blockchain develops really fast. To fully verify more and more complex transactions you have to store something more than just seed or private keys. As I mentioned above, storing ABIs is not enough. UX wise, big screen is a must. It doesn\u2019t make too much sense by just adding ABIs. This might be the reason why they are not doing this.  ",

I have a bunch of keystore files and private keys which I\u2019d love to airgap, but so far haven\u2019t found a way to do so because afaik no HW wallet supports private key import. The usual recommendation is to move funds over to a new, mnemonic based, account. But for old accounts with a lot of different tokens accumulated, some of which deposited in protocols, that can easily translate to xxxx $ worth of tx fees. My limited understanding of BIP32 and this EIP suggests it may not work with private keys either. Is that the case? If so, is there a good reason for not supporting the use of private keys? Could the EIP be changed / extended to have that supported too? ",
