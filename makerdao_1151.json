Following discussion between PE and GovAlpha, the teams concluded that due to a lack of proposals or items requiring inclusion in the next Executive Vote, it would make sense to skip the planned vote on 2022/06/01 and resume the usual Executive Vote schedule the following week on 2022/06/08. GovAlpha will still post weekly polls next week, with a number expected to go live on Monday, May 30th. Please comment below or reach out directly if you have questions or concerns. The most recent Executive Vote went live yesterday and can be voted on here. ",
