                    "content": " Overview Back in January we changed Minimum Bid Increase (beg) to 4% and Bid Duration (ttl) to 60 minutes. @dmitri.z and I have been watching and participating in the flap auctions casually and observed and experienced a small downside on the current configuration we would like to fix with this Signal Request. The ttl is the amount of time an auction runs after the last bet, so having it set to 60 minutes means that an auction participant needs to commit to a MKR price for an hour - basically making a prediction of the MKR price in one hour. If you are lucky, the price after your bid (usually ~4% discount to market) is not changing too much - if it goes up more than ~2% you are already about to make a loss as the uniswap fees alone are 0.6%, not speaking of hedging, kicking and gas costs. A 2% swing within an hour on the MKR/DAI-price is actually not too rare. Of course we could increase the beg but that would just increase the discount on the auctions resulting in less MKR being burned. We think we should decrease the ttl, observe the effects for a while, and then maybe even reduce the beg later on.  Pros:  less time keepers need to commit to a MKR price smaller discount, higher MKR burn potentially attracts more participants in flap auctions   Cons:  higher risk for 0-bids   Adjust the ttl on flap-auctions Please vote for all options you would support in an onchain poll     No change (60 minutes) 45 minutes 30 minutes Abstain     0 voters      Next Steps The Polls will run until 2021-07-08T13:00:00Z; their outcomes will either result in on-chain-polls assuming the outcome of the polls deems it necessary or its intermediate results are going to be taken to another initiative - another signal, onchain-poll or urgency executive.

I was expecting a lot more stealing happening there, but it actually did not happen. Maybe @Primoz has some more solid data what happened on WW w.r.t. flaps? Imho especially with a lot of flaps happening within a couple of hours a lower ttl would actually be helpful as the bids are locked for less time. I am not advocating for lowering the beg here btw - right now I don\u2019t think less than 4% is reasonable ",

Then heck you could set the ttl to 10 minutes.  Could set it in automated parameters that when say an auction for 30,000 DAI goes up an oracle checks current price of MKR and sets the minimum at 50% of that, so say if MKR is $3,000, on that 30,000 DAI auction if the high bid is not at least 5 MKR - $15,000 - the auction fails.

Crypto markets can turn on a dime, and most arb opportunities disappear within a few blocks. OTOH flaps are probably the least dangerous auction type from a zero bid perspective\u2013it sucks for MKR holders if they get less burn, but it doesn\u2019t put the system in debt or hurt Vault users or DAI holders. So there\u2019s likely very little additional risk from 30 min as opposed to 60 min. If we want to try 30 min, IMO why not, but as others have pointed out the real solution is designing and implementing a better mechanism, so I\u2019d rather not spend too much time trying to hyper-optimize Flapper parameters.
