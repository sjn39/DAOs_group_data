This started when the MIPs process was introduced, and after a break, we\u2019re kicking them off again. We\u2019re experimenting with two 10-minute presentations from two different community members, followed by a 20-minute discussion for each presentation. Today we have real estate as a bigger theme. Matt and Kirill will introduce two different types of collateral types or ideas for collateral. Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.

What are the effects? 17:11 - Frank Cruz: Was New Silver around 10~15 years ago? I feel that I\u2019ve heard the company name before. 17:38 - Frank Cruz: Are you registered in all 50 states? 18:02 - Vitaly R: What would the liquidation process would look like in the context of MakerDAO? 20:47 - Lev: Would MakerDAO take the senior tranches? Could you please expand on that? 23:22 - Juan: Can an investor invest in the New Silver Vault and take part of the risk and profits or in this case it would only be MakerDAO? 25:52- Planet_X: As far as I understand, ERC1404 is like an ERC20 token, where you could limit the addresses that receive the token. Maybe you could look into it.  30:03 - LongForWisdom: Can you give an estimate of the amount of the senior tranch loans that you could generate through the Maker Protocol? 31:04 - Lucas Vogelsang: What\u2019s the time of an average loan?  6s Development Matthew Rabinowitz  6s Capital Forum Thread  Presentation 32:00 Cover Slide1293\u00d7728 201 KB Peter Drucker1290\u00d7726 90 KB External Centrlized Lending1290\u00d7725 159 KB Central Bank1293\u00d7727 136 KB Why does this matter?1293\u00d7721 61.7 KB Current Dai Market1287\u00d7725 74.6 KB DeFi yield farming1302\u00d7721 157 KB Edge of pool1282\u00d7717 74.9 KB Why is this critical?1291\u00d7721 152 KB Recommendation1289\u00d7722 148 KB What does that mean?1294\u00d7726 150 KB Commercial Real Estate1290\u00d7728 147 KB Starting Requirements1291\u00d7727 182 KB Equity Contribution1284\u00d7718 129 KB A gun to the head1291\u00d7722 181 KB Singular greatest issues1290\u00d7725 144 KB Structure1286\u00d7723 84.7 KB Structure with Maker1288\u00d7724 130 KB Centralizing Processes1287\u00d7721 99.7 KB Risk Teams1288\u00d7720 110 KB Components needed1288\u00d7720 116 KB 6s Capital Executive Summary1318\u00d7760 98.6 KB Philosophy1292\u00d7725 139 KB Organizational Structure1292\u00d7724 91.6 KB Process1288\u00d7721 108 KB Money Movement1289\u00d7723 98 KB Key Takeaway1291\u00d7724 163 KB Risk Analysis1288\u00d7722 121 KB Best of Both Worlds1292\u00d7725 124 KB Resistant1290\u00d7721 94.4 KB Discussion  43:42 - Martin: Who is the signing the credit facility agreement for Maker with 6s Capital? 44:45 - S\u00e9bastien Deriveaux: Can a DAO sign a contract? 45:17 - LongForWisdom: The DAO needs to trust the representative then? 46:00 - Lucas Vogelsang: Could the Community elect 20 entities to be part of this trust? How many honest participants would you need? 47:06 - Lucas Vogelsang: You said that the people should be uncomfortable holding Dai or having a Dai debt in this scenario? 49:22 - S\u00e9bastien Deriveaux: Do you have any idea of the amount you want to borrow? 49:44 - LongForWisdom: In terms of outstanding borrowers at any one time, what is that roughly? 50:42 - S\u00e9bastien Deriveaux: How much equity can you put in the SPV? 51:09 - Will Remor: In terms of the credit quality, because it\u2019s a revolving loan facility, it\u2019s very important to monitor of the credit quality, as it might be changing. How could Maker be assured that you\u2019re actually monitoring the credit quality of the underlying facilities? 52:48 - Will Remor: Would it be acceptable that the interest rate that is charged is dynamically set rather than dynamically set? 54:06 - Will Remor: I think it\u2019s very important that all the information is available, so that the pricing mechanism can be set right every time. 57:45 - Lucas Vogelsang: You\u2019re talking about backup servicing companies that do this as well like in a traditional credit world, where you can have third party servicer that can take over a portfolio of loans if the operating company is going bankrupt? 59:31 - S\u00e9bastien Deriveaux: For both projects we\u2019re talking about fixed rates, right?  Closing Comments Lucas Vogelsang Outro 1:00:25  Thanks, everyone, for joining. We\u2019ll do another one in two weeks. Same time. Open for suggestions on new topics, new collateral types, and feedback on format. There\u2019s a Forum Thread on these calls. Also, if you want to continue the conversation on:  New Silver Forum Thread 6s Capital Forum Thread   Let\u2019s keep going the conversation there, and I hope to see you in two weeks.
