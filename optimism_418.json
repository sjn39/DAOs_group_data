This interface will be designed to make it as easy as possible for users to interact with the Optimism Network, whether paying for gas in $OP or participating in Optimism Quests. The project will include the following features:  A step-by-step guide for new users on how to set up their wallet and start using the Optimism Network Intuitive and user-friendly interface for paying gas and interacting with the network Built-in support for $OP as a gas token, with the ability for users to switch between $OP and ETH as a gas token A dashboard that provides real-time updates on network status, including current gas prices and network utilization A marketplace where users can find and interact with decentralized applications (DAPPS) built on the Optimism Network A community forum where users can share tips and knowledge, ask questions, and interact with other community members.  This project would be a great opportunity to take advantage of the growing interest in the Optimism Network and the $OP token. It would make it much easier for new users to get started with the network and increase adoption and use of the network by simplifying the user experience. In addition, by providing a marketplace for DAPPS, it would also provide an opportunity for developers to showcase their work and reach a wider audience. ",

You are in it     Floyd11:  Built-in support for $OP as a gas token, with the ability for users to switch between $OP and ETH as a gas token   This has a great discussion thread here:    Change the use of OP tokens from a governance token to the main network token for gas payment \ud83d\udc8c Ideas & Feedback       I am absolutely against this proposal. Using OP tokens as gas has many flaws:   Optimism is EVM equivalent. Accepting OP tokens as gas means giving up on EVM equivalence. Moreover, Optimism has to pay fees to Ethereum Mainnet in ETH. How will the OP<->ETH conversion be handled? Currently, the CALLVALUE opcode returns the amount of Ether sent to a contract. If the OP token is accepted as the gas token, how will this opcode work? Will it return the Ether amount or the OP amount sent to the contrac\u2026     Where the main reason to not use OP as a gas token is breaking EVM equivalence  and even Vitalik it\u2019s against it:  twitter.com    vitalik.eth @VitalikButerin  This is a great example of why I'm so proud of @optimismPBC for adding non-token governance (the Citizen House).  Optimism explicitly has goals *other* than just \"make OP go up\", and the only way to do that long-term is with explicit representation of non-token-holder interests. https://t.co/vofVVx53mC   1:22 AM - 3 Jun 2022           4.4K                850            ",
