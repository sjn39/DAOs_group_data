A couple if interesting takeways from their explained tokenimics:  Soft-pegged to USD and will not allow USDC as collateral Vaults will have a borrow rate (i.e. stability fee) and a mint fee that will be used to burn their governance token. Potentially a good idea for us Cosmos blockchain selected for their project, potentially due to the lack of a native stablecoin on the chain, low fees and relatively easy to develop on  Would love to hear your thoughts and if you think this stablecoin will have any traction ",
