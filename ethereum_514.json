                    "content": "TL;DR: Here is a template for planning out cashflow and budgets for projects. Let\u2019s use these to have a discussion about sustainability, the complexity & need for some global  entities, and how to work together and improve all of this.  For our own work at SPADE in getting support for ERC1066 and the rest of FISSION Suite, and our new project around EVM Evolution, I modified a set of cashflow / budget planning spreadsheets that I\u2019ve used to support new startups. It\u2019s a vastly simplified version of Christoph Janz\u2019s Point Nine Capital Financial Planning for SaaS startups. Cashflow & Budget Planning Worksheet - Google Docs   docs.google.com    Open Source Budget TEMPLATE Open Source Project Template   O, Open Source Budget Template, Dec-18, Jan-19, Feb-19, Mar-19, Apr-19, May-19, Jun-19, Jul-19, Aug-19, Sep-19, Oct-19, Nov-19, Dec-19, Jan-20, Feb-20, Mar-20, Apr-20, May-20, Jun-20, Jul-20, Aug-20, Sep-20, Oct-20,...      Use File > Make a Copy.. so you can edit it. Please DO make comments directly on the sheet if you have questions I developed these this summer and shared them with some of the ECF team when I heard that nothing like this was being used to support teams. I also used them for our ECF and EF grant submissions. A startup (or new business), isn\u2019t fundamentally different than an Ethereum project. The project may be inside an existing company, but in many cases grants go to individuals or teams who are thrown into the deep end of having to create new corporate entities. This means getting legal and accounting setup, getting banking facilities, and everything else around tracking cash, not running out of money, and planning for the future. These worksheets are by no means done. Some of the issues include: It assumes zero costs for an office or hardware. They don\u2019t really include a plan for annual taxes of a corporation. They run at \u201cbreak even\u201d for the project \u2013 meaning there is no \u201cmargin\u201d on top of paying people, meaning there is no buffer. I started work on a recurring sponsorship model, which really needs to be expanded. And, this is at the project level. If one company takes on multiple projects, then cashflow can be buffered and some expenses shared. (I really need to document all these issues / assumptions) Collaborating on Solving Issues I had early discussions with Ben, the head of the Status Incubate program, of how to share resources on getting to sustainability as companies, as small teams, as projects. The business model ring that @owocki kicked off is obviously related. There are early discussions beginning about a couple of related topics. One is how grants are handed out \u2013 if you don\u2019t already have a company setup and need to scale beyond one person, all of this setup has to be repeated for each project. Does this mean grants should go to existing organizations? Or should individuals and small teams be encouraged to form? How should they be supported? How can we \u201cshare\u201d some of this setup? The second is the need for long term security & sustainability. One off bounties and small grants might fund a 3 - 6 month project. But a year or two years are more appropriate for some deep problems, especially in the sense of having the individuals working on it having it as their full time job \u2013 where they don\u2019t need to be constantly looking at getting another small grant to keep going. What Should People Get Paid? Related to this is a discussion around market rates. Apparently, for many individuals in the ecosystem, they were making very low rates compared to programming jobs in the industry. It\u2019s great that people want to work on open source \u2013 but if anything it should be MORE expensive, because it can be re-used and doesn\u2019t need to be re-written multiple times. Buffer \u2013 which is a transparent, global company with team members around the globe \u2013 has a public salary calculator for roles that might be a useful starting point for discussion. That page also links to their spreadsheet of all their staff salaries as a reference. Minimum Entity? I had reviewed Open Collective for EthMagicians as one existing structure that could be used to support open source projects without having to setup an entity \u2013 but then a lot of the other work goes back to the individual who has to figure out the rules around laws and taxes in their home country (or rules for what it means to be a nomad worker). This came up in Meta Magicians as well. We need to define the problems that we are solving. Some are \u201chave a bank account\u201d and \u201cmake sure taxes are paid\u201d. Others might be \u201cformally employ or contract people in some country\u201d or \u201chelp pay and manage health benefits\u201d (cough USA cough). Disclaimer My disclaimer? I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time, and the foundation that @expede and I created \u2013 SPADE \u2013 was in part created to potentially be a friendly corporate entity that can help support individuals and teams with the fiat- and state-based world. I created an \u201copen source\u201d corporation 15 years ago in growing the Drupal ecosystem, and saw a lot of the same issues. I knew this was going to be a problem for us, so thought about it a little ahead of time as part of the setup. I\u2019ve been tracking related concepts around commons based peer production and changing open source licenses and support models. Oh, and Opolis \u2013 started around ETHDenver \u2013 may solve some of the portable entity issues. They have an entity in the US for starters. Next Steps Do we want to do a call to discuss this topic broadly? What problems need to be solved? I am putting up my hand to help people fill out these cashflow and budget worksheets for their project, including hiring plans, capturing other costs, and so on. Leave a comment or DM me and we can setup a call. ",

We have a Funders League group call that has been brainstorming how to lower the barrier to entry for devs looking for support (shoot me your telegram if you want to jump in). This has manifested into a potential \u2018grant clearing house\u2019 concept where people can bring proposals to be refined and receive advise on where they should submit. Coming up with some reasonable guidelines on how folks should expect to be paid would ease the decision making process for programs and help set stronger expectations - I like the conversation you started here. RE: Cryptoeconomic approaches to receiving funding \u2013 I agree with examining more approaches to understand how to most effectively distribute capital. The EF Grants program has been able to give to both entities and individuals\u2026 if the individuals have a team working with them we prefer for an entity to be formed at some point. Understanding tax law etc for these funds is another thing that I know is a large cognitive overhead for the grant recipients and would be really useful for there to be a central advisory source to help with this. Ultimately developing a \u2018common app\u2019 type system for funding would be highly beneficial for the ecosystem. ",

Might crypto be used to collect votes / funds for what is important to work on? Maybe. That\u2019s not the layer that this is about. Let\u2019s say an R&D project with $250K of funding was funded \u2013 how do 2 people work on it for a year? How do they need to setup their company or freelance structures? What other tasks and costs do they have? And, for example, our original FISSION Codes budget had $30K worth of bounties budgeted for various integrations, translations, and so on. That\u2019s using crypto incentives at a certain layer. Even work that can be turned into smaller tasks effectively, has to be turned into those tasks by someone. Does that help? ",

Another missing piece from the templates I created would be tracking different currencies. They are currently denominated in USD. Not sure a spreadsheet is the best way to model a whole multi-currency treasury management model. I mentioned on Twitter, I think something like 6 months of expenses in whatever currency the expenses need to be paid in could be a good rule of thumb to start with. That expenses currency is the key part. If people involved are being contracted in DAI \u2013 great! But if they are being paid in USD or EUR, then likely they should be kept in that expense currency, rather than pushing the conversion to the end receiver. As I said, would love some input from some finance operations / treasury management experts! @decanus @fubuloubu @chisel don\u2019t know if Yalor has an account here. ",

At the Ethereum Foundation, there is currently a base rate for contractors that varies based on experience, but IMO is generally too low for major cities. I have been advocating that there be a global base rate based on experience + an additional amount based on regional living costs. The regional addition would be changed once the contractor notifies their lead that he/she will be living somewhere for longer than a month. Recently I started thinking that if a person is moving around a lot, the EF should carry that person\u2019s living expenses, and otherwise give that person the base rate. ",
