                    "content": " MIP65/ BOND STRATEGY ALLOCATION REVIEW & VOTE: Baillie Gifford Strategy  Maker Customised Long-term, Investment-Grade, Corporate Bond, Alpha Strategy   1/ Motivation MIP65 provides the framework and operating infrastructure to reallocate USDC 500M to institutional bond strategies. Our expectation is to allocate these USDC 500M to several asset managers and strategies and seek the views of the community on the individual asset manager, their bond strategy and how much of the USDC 500M should be allocated towards this asset manager and bond strategy. This is our first such community request. We here present Baillie Gifford, their proposed strategy and provide analysis around it and seek the community\u2019s views on this strategy and allocation via poll. Next up, over the coming week, will be a strategy built together with Bank Sygnum and BlackRock using the BlackRock ETF universe. We will accept the resulting community vote and will execute as such under an approved MIP65.  2/ Recommended Allocation / Monetalis We would recommend a 20% allocation (USD 100M) to Baillie Gifford for either Strategy Option A or B. Please see section 6a/ for arguments.  3/ Manager/Advisor  3a/ Background on Manager Baillie Gifford (\u201cBG\u201d) is a private investment partnership with origin and head-office in Edinburgh, Scotland. From web-site: \u201c\u2026Baillie Gifford was established as an investment management partnership over 110 years ago. Much has changed since then. For Baillie Gifford, seeking superior, long-term investment returns for our clients has not. Our current generation of partners and employees remains single-minded about our clients\u2019 requirements. They are responsible for the careful stewardship of our long-term vision without the distraction of short-term shareholder demands. This ownership structure allows us to attract and retain the best investment talent, creating a distinctive and enduring culture. Baillie Gifford are long-term investors, not speculators. Our investment philosophy focuses on growth while our universe is global. Accordingly, we believe that fundamental analysis and proprietary research are core to a successful, long-term, bottom-up investment approach. From our head office in Edinburgh we are able to harness this intellectually curious and rigorous approach \u2013 where the sharing of ideas and robust debate between our investment teams are central to our investment process. The result is a successful business that continues to grow organically. We now manage and advise \u00a3277bn (US$ 365bn) in specialist equity, fixed income and multi-asset portfolios for a global client base.\u201d www.bailliegifford.com  3b/ Track Record in Fixed Income BG has been managing specialist fixed income mandates for over 30 years for institutions and funds globally. The credit team is responsible for c.$4.5bn in assets, with 10 year track records as follows for key fund strategies (in % p.a.) :     Fund Return Benchmark \u201cAlpha\"     Strategic Bond Fund 5.7 3.9 1.8   Investment Grade Bond Fund 4.9 4.4 0.5   High Yield Bond Fund 5.8 4.4 1.4   World Wide Global Strategic Bond Fund 5.5 3.8 1.7     3c/ Individual Manager for Portfolio BG operates with a team-based structure and the whole credit team carries out investment analysis that will contribute to the portfolio. However for this Maker mandate, Paul Dilworth, would be lead portfolio manager (bio below) with another experienced investment manager to assist in decision-making (to be confirmed in due course).  990\u00d7615 172 KB  Paul Dilworth - Investment Manager \u201c\u2026Paul is an investment manager in the Credit Team and manages our investment grade bond funds. Before joining Baillie Gifford in 2019, he worked for almost 13 years at Kames Capital where he was responsible for managing a broad range of fixed income mandates, including Global Financial Credit, Global Absolute Return and Investment Grade Credit. Paul graduated BSc (Hons) in Mathematics from Heriot-Watt University in 2006 and is a CFA Charterholder.\u201d  4/ Maker Baillie Gifford LT CB Alpha Strategy Concept In BG credit team\u2019s own words: \u201c\u2026Our strength in credit investing lies in the ability to identify the relatively small number of corporate bonds that will outperform the market over a long-term investment horizon. We believe that, over the long term, an issuer\u2019s fundamental resilience will be reflected in the performance of its bonds and will prevail over shorter-term or sentiment-driven market fluctuations. Our in-depth analysis focuses on building a comprehensive understanding of a company\u2019s long-term prospects and genuine diversity, based on deep knowledge of individual companies, allows for thoughtful risk taking. We have various strategies with long-term track records which demonstrate this ability to add value through individual bond selection.\u201d \u201c\u2026We believe our strengths align very well with the aims of MakerDAO and include, as a core of our proposal, an actively managed long-term credit strategy. This relatively short-dated and high-quality portfolio would deliver attractive levels of yield to compensate for some mark-to-market volatility.\u201d \u201c\u2026An actively managed portfolio representing our best ideas across global corporate bond markets. A relatively short-dated investment grade portfolio provides a balance of liquidity and low-probability of loss while still offering potential to add value through active credit selection. The current yield of this universe is around 3.5% with a spread above US treasuries of around 1%.\u201d We have worked with BG to come up with 2 strategy options based upon the long-term active bond selection principles above. The difference lies in the credit universe accessed and results in two different index overperformance targets.   Option A is focused purely on investment grade bonds (including unrated bonds with an investment grade equivalent internal rating) and has a target of +0.5% over index performance target.   Option B adds a 20% budget for sub-investment grade bonds that are rated minimum BB- or equivalent and has a target of +1% over index performance target.   The BG credit team\u2019s research, and practical investment experience, has shown that the \u2018cross-over\u2019 space between investment grade and high yield (BBB to BB-) is where it observes most inefficiencies, creating substantive alpha generating opportunities for active bond selectors. The BG team\u2019s philosophy is to focus on lending to resilient issuers and therefore it tends to select higher quality high yield bonds, often where in-house fundamental research has identified companies which are likely to improve credit quality over time. BG also observes that the divide between investment grade and high yield can be arbitrary, as, for example, a 1-year BB rated bond would carry lower default risk than a 5-year BBB rated bond. In short, the 20% budget in option B provides a level of flexibility that enables a meaningfully higher level of performance to be targeted, without lifting risk in any material way. Further data on this \u201ccross-over\u201d space will be delivered in a separate post to this Poll.  5/ Strategy Parameter Proposal: A & B Options     Parameter Value     Benchmark ICE BoFa 1-5yr US Corp Index   Target  Option A: +0.5%, gross of fees, over rolling 3 year period  Option B: +1%, gross of fees, over rolling 3yr period   Universe Global, fully-hedged to USD   Credit Quality  Option A:Wholly investment grade rated bonds (including unrated bonds with an equivalent internal rating)  Option B: Average portfolio rating investment grade.

Further details available once allocation size determined   Investment Mode Segregated Account/Custodian     6/ Analysis of Strategy  6a/ Fit with Maker Asset Allocation Strategy for potential MIP65 allocation We expect the Maker USDC exposure to become, within a reasonably short time-horizon, mainly replaced by liquid RWA instruments. We expect the resulting RWA exposure to be broadly diversified, because the TradFi response to DeFi is still in large scale flux and, as such, we don\u2019t want Maker overly exposed to any one single TradFi/DeFi integration risk vector. Therefore, in practice, the RWA long-term asset allocation must be:   A multi-manager solution (for best-of-breed selection + point of failure minimisation)   A multi-instrument solution (ETF + customised strategies + potentially other - again for point of failure minimisation and selection)   Global (USD hedged), sector, industry, duration etc   In addition, to gently push for increasing yields from this RWA exposure, we need the overarching asset allocation to straddle across extremely simple, risk-free and low yielding instruments on one end, to instruments with more return capacity (and thus certain risks) at the other end. And accomplish this within the constraints of a broader Investment-Grade mandate. Our intention, with MIP65\u2019s allocation of DAI 500M, is for it to act as a scalable micro-version of the overall asset allocation that might be considered for Maker liquid bonds - i.e. it can be scaled up to many billions. Our expectations for the initial MIP65 asset allocation strategy will be a simple barbell in shape (but with more weight in the very low risk end than the other end) and then modified over time as further ALM analysis is done and the balance sheet of Maker evolves. This particular BG strategy, both A and B, sits comfortably in the higher yield barbell end without pushing anything too far. Its merits are:  Allows for working with a high-quality manager under a customised mandate Allows for a Manager selection-based alpha generation in the long-term Strategy built upon the strength and growth of the corporate sector (vs government/supranationals) in the long-term Reasonably within an investment-grade mandate Limited Mark-to-market variation Very limited liquidity constraints  We believe, in any long-term yield generating overall asset strategy for Maker, there would be some element of alpha focused strategies within the corporate bond universe - and that this option seem a credible start to this. As such, a 20% allocation sounds appropriate and should lead to competitive fees and leave more than adequate room for simple index and government/supranational focused bond strategies from other asset managers - such as next week\u2019s presentation from Sygnum/BlackRock on exactly such an extremely low risk strategy.  6b/ Manager Historical Performance These fund options are customised for Maker to create a balance between being on the side of security, whilst making room for alpha from bond selection and market distortions in the public market investment grade ratings. As such there is no direct comparable fund today delivered by BG to the public. However, two BG public funds appear relevant:   \u201cBaillie Gifford Investment Grade Bond Fund\u201d (\u201cBGIG\u201d) seems the most relevant fund available for analysis of Option A. This has a sterling investment grade benchmark with relatively little flexibility to invest in HY. It does have the challenge of being UK focused.   \u201cBaillie Gifford Worldwide Global Strategic Bond Fund\u201d (\u201cBGWW\u201d)seems the most relevant fund available for analysis of Option B. It has an allocation towards high-yield bonds without a BB- constraint, which the Maker Option B Bond Strategy does not. Because of this, the fund also has a more aggressive mixed benchmark of 70% ICE Bofa Global Corp + 30% ICE Bofa Global HY.   6b1/ Direct Performance As per 3b/ we see appropriate overperformance of the two relevant funds over the past 10 years in-line with their proposed alpha targets. 6b2/ Comparable Performance BGWW is best compared to the Morningstar Global Flexible Bond Sector of funds. Within this, BGWW has been in the top percentile since its inception in 2012. BGIG has a more mid-tier rating. Overall, as Manager, BG appears a high-quality choice. BG does appear to, relatively speaking, perform better when allowed broader freedoms as under Option B and can use their skills in identifying and exploiting inefficiencies from doing fundamental company research.  6c/ Projected performance Over a 10-year period the best practical indicator of return for an investment grade portfolio is generally considered to be the current market yield. Therefore, if the performance targets above are achieved, the net return should be in the region of 3.75% - 4.25% per annum. BG believes this is a reasonable expectation of return in the medium term given the current starting point \u2013 inflation has quite likely peaked and much central bank reaction is already priced in. Further, this relatively short-dated portfolio will be frequently re-invested at prevailing yields.  6d/ Liquidation Analysis BG has run the model portfolio for Option B (as Option A would just be a slightly better version in respect of liquidity) through their liquidity systems and engaged with dealers to give a liquidity view based upon current conditions. It would rate as a highly liquid portfolio. The primary liquidity monitoring tool is the ICE Vantage system, and BG typically test their credit portfolios assuming 40% market capture with a price tolerance of no more than 1% above current mid-bid spreads. The results thereof - including the impact of tightening the price tolerance to 0.25% - in current market condition are as follows with a USD 500M portfolio size:     Price Impact Portfolio % Liquidated within x days     1% 97% within 1 day   0.25% 67% within 1 day  83% within 3 days    The mid-bid spread on BG\u2019s general credit portfolios is currently in the region of 0.25-0.40%. At lower volume (<500M), such as the recommended allocation level of 100M, the portfolio becomes even more liquid. Should it be requested, BG can incorporate further liquidity requirements into the mandate such as limiting the individual size of issue in which BG invests.  6e/ Market-Value Variation Analysis  The chart above shows rolling volatility (averaged over 1, 3 and 5 year periods) of the ICE BofA 1-5 Years US Corporate Index. The long-term average annualised volatility of this index is 2.9%.  7/ Reporting BG provides a quarterly investment analysis report (sample from BGWW here and detailed monthly accounting reports.  Should Maker require it, additional reporting can be provided.  8/ Legal The trust structure will have to undergo KYC/AML checks from BG (has not yet been completed). Given this in place, the investment mandate is simply controlled through an Investment Mandate Agreement between BG and the trust structure.  9/ AMA of Portfolio Manager BG will present this strategy and answer questions in an AMA next week. It will be recorded. Invitation to follow shortly.  10/ Further Analysis to come in posts ASAP  Evidence on Option B \u201c20% budget\u201d risk/return situation Scenario-based performance of strategies   11/ Community Vote on Strategy & Allocation NOTE: To ensure you have all the facts before voting, we recommend not voting before you have read Strategic Finance considerations on this potential allocation and reviewed/participated in the AMA with BG. This poll will run for 1 week.    Should Maker allocate capital (from the potential MIP65 USD 500M allocation) to Baillie Gifford Maker Strategy Option A or B - or should Maker not allocate to either of these strategies?  Allocate to Strategy A Allocate to Strategy B Do not allocate to either     0 voters        Given you voted for an allocation above, how large should such allocation be out of the potential MIP65 USD 500M?  10% - 50M 20% - 100M 25% - 125M 30% - 150M 40% - 200M     0 voters     ",

                    "content": " MIP65 Baillie Gifford Verification The verification here is done on behalf of the Strategic Finance facilitator as described in MIP65 (yet to be approved). This verification use MIP13c3-SP12 Declaration of Intent - Invest in short-term bonds as a framework. This is non-binding for either Monetalis or MakerDAO.  Counterparty As stated by  MIP13c3-SP12: Counterparties involved in the operations should be established and reputable companies (using metrics such as Asset under Administration and Asset under Management); Baillie Gifford assets under management is north of $450B end of 2021 and exists for more than a century. The credit part is smaller, with  c.$4.5bn in assets.  895\u00d7478 82.5 KB  The company is owned by its 47 partners. It is clearly in the reputable companies bucket.  Liquidity As discussed by BG, liquidity is not a major concern in normal market operations. It would be less liquid during TradFi market stress. Moreover, as it is only a subset of the expected allocation, it is less of a burden.  Investment strategy The assessment was based on an example portfolio that suit option B. It was compared to the ICE BoFa 1-5yr US Corp Index. Data are from February. The credit spread is quite higher at 146bps vs 93bps for the index. BBB exposure and minus is 70% in the example portfolio vs 46% for the index. This is of course expected as the mandate B allows for some exposure to BB. The declaration of intent was allowing 20% max to BBB and didn\u2019t allowed exposure below BBB. Duration is lower in the example portfolio with 2.59 duration vs 2.70 in the index. This reduces the interest rate risk. It is still above the declaration of intent (average duration up to 2 years). The duration of BB exposure is 0.42, therefore, the riskier part is quite short duration. Same applies for the safest part with the A average duration being 0.57 vs 1.21 for the index. Nevertheless, the actual maturity is quite different from the duration due to the presence of a 15% exposure to perpetuals. Some of those perpetuals have a reset period in the short term but will then get a 5-yr rate for 5 years. This could be a serious issue and should be investigated. As those cases are mainly (but not only) related to BB exposure, we recommend to understand that mandate A is without those, while mandate B would include them. It is not saying that those exposures are a problem per se, just that it would require more research to get a sense of the impact. Another main component of this mandate is the deviation in country exposure. USA, which represent 65% exposure in the index, is clearly underweight (30%) in favor of UK (27% vs 6%). This is quite expected with a UK manager. There is also a currency diversification with 11% in EUR and 16% in GBP (the index being 100% USD). Those exposures are hedged. Therefore, per se, the mandate is not consistent with the declaration of intent. Yet, it is not intented as a full portfolio neither. Monetalis expect the whole 500M portfolio to be below 2yr duration and with less than 20% BBB (and minus in case option B is retained) exposure. Baillie Gifford and Monetalis are proposing a actively managed and concentrated (100 issuers) mandate. Those are the strength of Baillie Gifford. It should therefore be seen in the framework of a whole portfolio. This is coherent with the barbell approach suggested by Monetalis in the past. On investing in BB bonds, this is a decision community need to take as it couldn\u2019t be solved even in a whole portfolio. It is obvious that most mandate forbid non investment-grade, therefore it is not unexpected to have a pricing mismatch in non-investment grade. You can read this analysis by PIMCO showing the value of the cross-over space. It should nevertheless be understood that using BB exposure will increase the credit risk budget required.  Conclusion The mandate A, with the understanding that it is based only on vanilla bonds (excl. perpetuals and long maturity), fits the declaration of intent. The mandate B doesn\u2019t fit the declaration of intent spirit. It is up to the community to decide. With the example portfolio, the allocation to such a mandate should not go above 25%, and I would suggest to keep it at 20% maximum, especially if Mandate B is chosen. Overall, adding Baillie Gifford to our team of public markets asset managers (currently empty) would probably be a good thing. Starting simple and and refining with their expertise will help us to move forward. ",

                    "content": "Hi @rune , A very reasonable argument viewed through a Clean Money lens. You will see a strategy with \u201cGov Bonds only\u201d presented later this week that should support your proposed requirements. Before we reject the proposed BG Corp Bond strategies on Clean Money misalignment grounds, to be fair to BG, let me present BG\u2019s thinking about ESG, as that was part of the reasons we had originally started to work with BG some time ago. Actually - given the quite strong statements made in the forum recently against Clean Money and the fact that these statements received limited opposition - plus perhaps a general sense that the community seems to evaluate a collateral\u2019s Clean Money alignment more as a \u201cnice to have\u201d feature, than a \u201cneed to have\u201d requirement - we simply steered away from putting anything about this in the bond strategy analysis. We have probably judged the community\u2019s vigour of Clean Money support wrongly, and so we appreciate you bringing it up so we can add this dimension to the analysis.  BG on ESG/Sustainability/Clean Money: Supporting the right company I think we all know that asset managers today score all bonds on ESG - and you can essentially, as investor, decide a scoring threshold for what bonds you are willing to invest in. Equally I think we all know that there are material issues with scoring standardisation and the quality/meaningfulness of the scoring. One might go as far as to say that certain asset managers are essentially check-boxing their way through a green-washing of their portfolio. This type of behaviour, of course, we have zero interest in supporting whatsoever. BG have taken a different approach - an approach we think might have some merit. I will summarise it here via quotes and explain why it might work for Maker, but I will encourage reading this thoughtful piece from BG on their approach: Actual ESG. BG is an active, long-term investor, using fundamental company analysis to drive its bond selection. That starting point means sustainability/Clean Money becomes an integral part of company and bond analysis:  \u201cSustainability in our philosophy and process A detailed understanding of the factors driving the fortunes of the companies in which we invest is crucial to our success. We choose to focus on resilience as the key to companies\u2019 likely success or failure over the long term. Resilience ensures that companies can adapt as technologies and societies change and as economies wax and wane. Sustainability is one of the three key factors we use to assess resilience alongside company prospects and capital structure. Our goal is to establish if the company is compatible with a sustainable economy. In our view, the transition to a sustainable economy, one which achieves a balance between economic, environmental and social needs, has begun. We believe this is a material shift that will affect all companies, creating long-term investment opportunities as well as risks. In our view, capital will be reallocated towards businesses that appropriately manage their impacts on society and the environment. Furthermore, we believe that corporate bond prices do not fully reflect sustainability-related risks. Sustainability analysis is, therefore, a core element of our company research framework because we believe this factor is fundamental to long-term returns. By assessing whether each investment is compatible with a sustainable economy, we believe we are building more resilient corporate bond portfolios for our clients. Given the importance of this factor, we explicitly exclude companies that our analysts deem to be unsustainable.\u201d  In practice, the BG ESG team have built a quantitative resilience score (and I will leave the BG team to explain this in the AMA) and perform a qualitative assessment slotting the potential company/issuer into the following sustainability archetypes:  \u201cEnabler \u2013 the company is enabling the transition to a sustainable economy and has a low-risk sustainability profile. An enabler may offer an investment opportunity as capital is allocated to companies that provide solutions to sustainability issues. Leader \u2013 the company is actively neutralising sustainability shortfalls and/or developing positive sustainability features. The company is compatible with a sustainable economy and has a low-risk sustainability profile. A leader may offer an investment opportunity as capital is allocated to companies with positive sustainability characteristics. Neutral \u2013 The company is compatible with a sustainable economy and has a low-risk sustainability profile. Adapting - the company has a weak sustainability profile but has outlined clear commitments to improve. The company is therefore compatible with a sustainable economy but is medium to high risk. The company will be set specific sustainability-related investment milestones and will be monitored closely. Failure to achieve milestones may lead to divestment. Unsustainable \u2013 the company has a negative sustainability profile with no commitments to improve. The company is not compatible with a sustainable economy and is uninvestable. \u201c  Again I will leave it to the BG team\u2019s AMA to qualify this assessment process further. As the bonds considered by BG are generally traditional rather than sustainability linked, the primary means of ESG advancement within the company/issuer is through company engagement:  \u201cCompany engagement Engaging with and monitoring our companies on an ongoing basis is a fundamental part of our investment process and how we discharge our stewardship duties. We expect our dialogue with issuers to be supportive or challenging, but always constructive and approached from a long-term perspective. We maintain an audit trail of our dialogue with issuers by recording engagements in our in-house systems. This enables us to monitor and report on the effectiveness of our engagements and set future priorities. As part of our monitoring process, we may set ESG investment milestones allowing us to track the progress of the engagement objective over a defined timeframe.\u201d  So here comes our thought process on a potential fit with Maker Clean Money:   Just like we have set thresholds for rating we can agree on thresholds with BG on resilience score and sustainability archetype. (for instance focus on Leaders and Enablers plus a certain higher sustainability score). This way we can reasonably ensure that Maker indeed only provides capital to companies who are expected to be part of a Green/Sustainable/Clean Money future.   It would allow Maker one mode of access to the vast traditional corporate bond universe, without compromising the Clean Money vision that seems anchored well in proper, prospective company analysis rather than \u201cbox checking\u201d. We think this access has substantial investment and \u201cadvancing corporate change\u201d merit in the short to medium term, as the sustainable/green bond market grows and matures.   All this, of course, given the community can find comfort in the assessment methodology of BG. We hope this clarifies. Again - just to repeat - we will follow the Community\u2019s judgement on this potential allocation. ",

It is great to read this proposal by the Monetalis team. Below my high-level comments. On the issuer: I think BG\u2019s expertise and knowledge of the market is unquestionable, this is the type of manager we should attract to manage sizeable amounts of either treasury liquidity or collateral for the protocols. On the strategy: I am abstaining from voting because of my following point on Process - i.e. I believe it is premature before a MIP6 to comment on committal votes on strategy. However, I would vote for Strategy A (conservative) simply for a simplicity/ process stance, I believe it would be advisable to \u2018start simple\u2019 and then make things more complex. The additional impact of going further out of the risk curve is negligible vs. start deploying ASAP. However, I don\u2019t have a strong negative feeling about Strategy B either, as I am sure BG can articulate a very clear strategy that defines boundaries and offers guarantees to the protocol. I will let Strategic Finance and @SebVentures commenting on liquidity given their mandate but being familiar with this asset class I am very comfortable. Also, question for @Aes, given the protocol\u2019s cash flow needs, would it be better to subscribe for an \u201cincome\u201d rather than \u201caccumulation\u201d class, and receive immediate yield benefit to fund operations and growth initiatives? I believe the Return on Capital of Maker is higher than that of IG bonds. On Monetalis: I believe Monetalis could be instrumental to make this a reality and I am looking forward to help the team tackle probably THE priority for the protocol. Would it be possible for the team to provide a clear description of the different layers of fees between Maker and the gross yield? And a simulation of how much Monetalis would earn from its role for different size buckets? I am referring to categories like (i) transaction costs, (ii) BG management fees, (iii) BG performance fees, (iv) BG rebates to Monetalis (if any), (v) Monetalis structuring costs. (vi) Monetalis performance fees, etc. On Process: based on the continuous reference to MIP65, I believe Monetalis still intends to proceed with a self-contained MIP and not via the collateral onboarding process that has been maintained and improved by @monkey.irish and the team. I will let MI comment, but I believe that a MIP6 might be more appropriate to proceed. Thank you for putting this together, regards, Luca ",

Yesterday in the webinar, they highlighted:  they integrated their sustainability / ESG check because it is part of the fundamentals of a business. BG does focus on long-term healthy businesses. For this they have to take care, businesses are ready to cope with a changing economy. For them, sustainability is key to get a business future-proof. they used the SASB materiality check on ESG. This is a well-established method with 1) checking on what is relevant/material regarding ESG, and 2) checking which of these relevant topics are actively managed.  I agree with @Allan_Pedersen that we should think about the option to agree with BG on thresholds for the resilience score and sustainability score. ",

Right now we have 13 voters (and thank you to those who have voted !) - which, in aggregate, cannot reasonably be considered the full voice of the community. To push the logic a bit, if one were to draw any conclusions from the poll, so far, it might be that the voice of the community is \u201cwe don\u2019t mind either way\u201d as that is where one could plausibly think the \u201cinvisible\u201d majority community vote is right now. We would very much like to see many more votes so we could be confident that the voting result is indeed a majority community choice. Otherwise we may unfortunately have to accept we have failed in getting the community appropriately engaged, cancel the poll, go back to the drawing board and rethink how we gain a better and stronger community and MKR voice into this allocation decisions.

What I like is the short term nature of these bonds and upon further reflection, I acknowledge that credit risk is very low.  But it\u2019s still a big jump from virtually no risk to any kind of risk.  Is there a reason you chose to do a corporate bond proposal first?  So do I read it correctly that we\u2019re only getting a .5% premium over treasuries and there\u2019s a .35% fee on top (is TBC to be calculated)?  So option A is only .15% better than treasuries after fees? ",

                    "content": "Hi @Traster_Tray Thank you for the questions! So, right now, I am writing a similar review for some BlackRock ETF treasury bond funds that probably needs to be seen in context to this review for it all to make better sense. The basic allocation strategy we were considering, as possibly appropriate for Maker, is basically this:  20% to Active Corp short Bonds (aligned with Clean Money principles) - i.e. this BG proposal 80% to US Treasury Index funds - some mix between two/three indexes (we are finding the exact right ones now). Our favorite two indexes right now are a 0-1y Tr Index and a 1-3y Tr index.  We see the BG proposal as a long-term Corp Bond alpha strategy (3 year is the target for alpha generation) and it is quite difficult to predict yield on this time-horizon given its active nature, interest rate movements and the economy. But we do know that holding good IG Corp bonds, generally, over a longer term pays well - the credit risk added is lower than return above risk-free produced (I think BG explained this well in the AMA). On top of that BG has a good alpha track-record. On fees, I believe we will find a lower expense ratio in discussion with BG given a 20% allocation - and potentially an alpha performance fee (I think BG also mentioned this in the AMA also). So the BG component is for Maker to tap into the higher yielding Corp bond market in the long-term, whereas the BlackRock ETF treasury index is a purely keeping money safe and gaining \u201crisk free\u201d short-term yields at lowest possible cost (0.07% expense ratio!), and in a highly liquid format etc\u2026 This overall pattern seemed, to us, to be the right sort of starting allocation that brought with it a prudent compromise between seeking yield and safety, having short-term and long-tem horizons and fitting with the clean money vision. But obviously it is up to the community to finally choose. I think now, upon reflection, reading your questions and seeing the voter numbers, that perhaps it is better we stop this poll and publish the BlackRock ETF review - and then put together a better poll that focuses on a \u201cfull picture\u201d allocation (i.e. across BG and BlackRock indexes).
