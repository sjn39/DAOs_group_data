In which way should we be framing this problem, asking the right questions, and making sure that we are not just the crypto bros trying to pump a market but instead having a meaningful long-term change? Is there a straightforward way to start in the right direction? 42:10 - Retro: You discussed creating this sideload teams that focus on that initiative. What standards would you encourage that team to have to keep in mind as they are progressing this massive goal? 45:24 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Is there such a thing as the ISO standards for anything that has to do with clean projects? 47:29 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Going back to the carbon credits, something that does not click is that it feels like rich countries would be paying poor countries to store their crap. Also, there is the enforcing factor with carbon at the end of the day. If some company or government decides to go out there and contaminate and ruin the world for everyone else, there is no clear way to tell them that they need to buy carbon credits. Because there is no law forcing them to do so. 50:36 - Frank Cruz: How will you capture the Oracle Price Feed, being that some of these carbon credit market reporting tools are stuck on Web 1.0? Also, with the narrative of forest offset credits being the most popular, are you going in that approach? How do you convince the real world companies that they need to reduce emissions and help out with this huge problem? 54:29 - Jack: Where does Bitgreen see itself fitting in within the ecosystem? Is it a case of you providing your products like the carbon credit marketplace or more of a consultancy role to help implement best practices in establishing projects for Maker? 57:19 - Lewis: How can you help financing projects instead of just helping a more liquid market of already issued carbon credits? 1:01:48 - Juan Guill\u00e9n: Is there something you would like to say? Where can people find you?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 1:04:22  Thank you, Adam, for that excellent presentation providing great background and insight into BitGreen\u2019s mission. The team at Maker is happy to help. As a follow-up, we will post your contact information into the forum post and a replay of the video. You will be getting a couple of pings for support over the next coming days. Thank you to everyone for joining.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.

Perfect timing to have those in preparation for 2022. @juan and team, can we try to do a bit of a rotation in timezone alignment for these calls? I am not sure if the community realises but by default we\u2019re excluding the whole of the developed Asia + Pacific from any calls we do as a community. Everyone is sleeping. Not saying every call but maybe 1 out of 3 or even out of 4 should be inclusive to timezones currently essentially absent from the community. Encouraging fresh new blood into the Maker community as a truly global project should be a strategic pillar on its own. ",
