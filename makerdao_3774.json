I\u2019d like suggest displaying MakerDAO\u2019s mission statement on the front page of the forum to guide day-to-day governance actions. This will be very helpful to newbies like myself. Thanks! P.S. mission-driven tech company like Tesla display their mission statement (\u201cAccelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy\u201d) on the wall of every Tesla office/store, I find it very powerful.

For DAI owners, we aspire to offer the most stable store of value that is secured by math not by military might. For DAI generators, we aspire to offer competitively priced interest rates on collateralized loans. Or maybe there is a mission statement that blends both of these aspirations together? ",
