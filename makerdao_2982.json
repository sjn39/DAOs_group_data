The WBTC-DAI pair is 20k and it is counterpart WBTC-USDC pair is 16M. Uniswap pair increase only if there is enough liquidity into it, then routes pass through it. By creating a vault, we should help to give some push to the liquidity and help Dai to become a major currency. Risk should be lower than WBTC itself and Uniswap contract is already checked. It is more about stimulated Dai than really about the return itself. further more we should probably look into all existing collaterals type we already have paired with Dai. ",
