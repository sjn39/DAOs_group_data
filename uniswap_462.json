Whilst ideally everyone should DYOR before Fomoing into something, this is not the case. This idea for a proposal is simple - When a token has been added and liquidity provided, any request for liquidity removal should be put on a timelock (ie 12 -24 hours) AND a notice in big shiny red letters on the trading page should appear, possibly with a link to the analytics page. The purpose of this being to deter scammers, and to warn potential buyers of the requested liquidity removal, more so than the pop-up disclaimer when importing a token. The warning could be something like this:  As this is just an idea, would be good to see what the community can come up with to improve on the idea! ",

I have done the 2 transaction, they pledge 200 ETH initially to attract the investor and the price went from $3.58 to $5.74. The creator pulled the plug by wiping out the contract, he earned 38 Eth extra and the liquidity become Zero. He invested 200Eth and earned 38 Eth in 30 mins. Time lock might be helpful in the future to protect investor interest and trust towards the Uniswap. Thanks ",
