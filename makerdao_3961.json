Our team is comprised of Tiago @tiago, Adam @adamgoth, Phil, Deniz, Tyler, and Rafa. We are a core unit that is in the process of incubation with the SES since June. Our mission is to enable the best-in-class decentralized decision-making for the Maker Protocol by providing a meaningful user experience for all governance participants. Our initial efforts will be directed toward improving and maintaining the governance portal and related tools.   _governance_experience_.png1400\u00d71400 113 KB   Our first major initiative is adding the vote delegation feature to the governance portal, which we\u2019ll be releasing publicly soon.   _vote_delegation_preview.png2880\u00d76704 1.61 MB   We\u2019ve also been busy developing our MIP in collaboration with the SES team, which will be posted here in the forums in time to meet the August 11 deadline. And, perhaps most importantly, by popular demand, we are finally releasing dark mode for the governance portal!   governance_darkmde.jpg2880\u00d71978 350 KB   We have many ideas for future enhancements, such as a decentralized version of the governance portal, a mobile app, and more. We will be working closely with the community in the coming weeks and months to gather input to prioritize features and develop our roadmap.
