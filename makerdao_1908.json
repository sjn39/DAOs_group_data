Given the low volume of the token, the Data Model leans towards AMMs since price manipulation on them is quickly arbitraged by MEV bots (often in the same block) and generally costs more transaction-wise than centralized exchanges. The GNO token is problematic from an Oracle risk perspective, and this should be accounted for in risk parameters if Maker Governance chooses to onboard GNO as collateral in the Maker Protocol. The issue stems from the liquidity being exceedingly small. The usual method of protecting from market manipulation is to sample a diverse array of exchanges. However, in the case of GNO, since the liquidity is so low for so many sources, it becomes much more feasible for an attacker to manipulate enough markets at the same time to execute an Oracle attack. As an additional precaution to Maker governance risk parameters, we recommend taking a subset of the available price sources based on highest 24h volume, level of trust, and on-chain preference. This results in a higher risk of source failure (and hence price update failure), but reduces the risk of price manipulation. ",
