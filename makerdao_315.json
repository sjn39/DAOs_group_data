Radicle.xyz is a permissionless and decentralized code collaboration tool that easily allows users to share code without relying on a third party. The solution is built as a peer-to-peer networking layer (called Radicle Link) on top of Git\u2019s smart transfer protocol, packfiles. Backed by public-key crypto, as a project gains interest more redundant copies are stored and shared locally with peers. Central servers are unnecessary for ensuring the discoverability and availability of changesets and social artifacts, differing from other repository solutions like GitHub. This enables a collaboration experience without intermediaries or vendor lock-in.  Why is it useful for Core Units? Radicle is first and foremost a protocol, not a platform.  The protocol aims to give collaborators back the control of their identity, content, and social interactions. Core Units have several diverse opportunities to implement Radicle when managing remote teams:  Potential Applications in MakerDAO  Anchor project state on-chain. Share ownership of repos with multi-sigs. Manage access control with smart contracts. Fund communities with NFT membership. Onboard grant funded or core team contributors with ease. Build and manage grant program workflows. Stream funds to contributors.  Potential Benefits of Radicle vs. Current Solutions  Free forever. Completely open source. Available everywhere. Intrinsic spam and content moderation. Global namespace and discoverability ( yourProject .radicle.eth).    Join us!  Our host is the man with a plan, and control over the mute button, @juan.

Welcome to Core Unit Tools episode #11. I am Retro. I am a contributor with the SES CU from MakerDAO. Today we are joined by Radicle. They are a decentralized Github and are here to share how their toolset can further progress the decentralization of CUs at MakerDAO. For other episodes of CUT, please check the forum.

Is this compatible? Are there examples of it being used with documentation? 25:13 - Frank Cruz: Are you looking to move to Open Source Cloud? If so, how do you think to do that? I might have seen something on Ceramic. Are you doing something for them or with them to decentralize the data that might be going onto something like the forum that we use a lot? It is pretty centralized, it is no secret. Can you comment on that? 28:54 - Frank Cruz: From a Web 2.0 view, would you say that you are similar to linear.app or a lot different where you are servicing more for Web 3.0? 30:47 - Raphael: We are focused on front-end systems. Our team heavily relies on automation. Right now, we are using different services but especially CircleCI and Versal for deployments. We also work with microservices and other things that we run. Do you support integrations with those systems to automate deployments and so on? 34:16 - Retro: What is the business model for Radicle? Is it a goal to make money? How do you make money as a project? 37:46 - Retro: What is the best way to get a hold of you?  Closing Comment  Retro  Outro 38:56  Thank you so much Nassar and Abbey from the Radicle team, for joining. As a quick shout out: @radicle.xyz/blog, it is a great resource to catch up quickly with the community and ecosystem. We will be sure to stay in touch and stay up to date with the developments of Radicle.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary.  @gala produced this summary.
