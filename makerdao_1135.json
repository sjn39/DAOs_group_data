Well, yes, in some places it changes more than just one person\u2019s life. I sense a kind of misguided egalitarianism in the salaries. I think that this kind of well-intentioned approach of using wages in developed countries as a benchmark for all countries is flawed and can be damaging in the medium to long term. It could put us at a competitive disadvantage with other protocols that take advantage of what it gives. The whole system should not be measured against the salaries used to lure professional finance and IT professionals and crypto rock stars. I understand and appreciate the concept, but I don\u2019t think we should give everyone in the world an American-style salary.  Not yet. We need to compete in a LOCAL labor market with fair, competitive wages. If that means we can employ more people for the same amount of money and thus achieve greater bandwidth, then that\u2019s what we should do. I believe that if we can give more people a job at a lower wage and give them a chance to start a better life, that is nothing to be ashamed of. ",

Of course, some people use it for that unfortunately, which is why it\u2019s important to talk about it. What\u2019s important to understand is that there are a lot of talented people looking for a chance to find something better beyond the opportunities offered by the local labour market, but for some reason (language, education, gender) it\u2019s not available to them. Of course, there are successful exceptions everywhere but they are a tiny minority. They are the ones who should be reached by a global organisation like Maker. The channel is of course a question. This one looks good to me:   omnipresent.com    Omnipresent - Global Employment For Remote Teams Let Omnipresent be your global HQ. We manage your payroll, benefits, compliance and taxes, so you can focus on growing your team. Book a call today.      Of course it is raised that all this is exploitation and contrary to the principles of the DAO. I do not agree with that. If you offer above-average salaries, a significant proportion of applicants will come from countries with above-average incomes. Why? Because for them it is worth working here and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s the goal. They are a very important resource for us that is not available elsewhere. But they are very expensive. In a developed country, a highly skilled LOCAL workforce is full of good opportunities so logically they expect a high wage to work here. We compete with global big banks and multinationals for these people. If we weren\u2019t capital rich and flexible we wouldn\u2019t be able to bring them in, even though they are the backbone of the Maker at the moment.  They\u2019re no longer the cypherpunk minded team that started Maker (ahh they were great guys too\u2026 but back to reality). In developing countries the salaries offered here seem astronomical.  That fact alone turns off a lot of applicants who would come from developing countries, because they know they don\u2019t stand a chance against well-qualified Western applicants. Conversely, they would be very keen to join sometimes just for the opportunity to practice and learn while doing the \u201cwood choping\u201d that eats up so much of the time of the expensively paid highly skilled labour. I\u2019m not saying they write our Smart Contracts.  But they can help a lot, as can the AI assisted programming. Unfortunately everyone blows the basic economic theorem that: more is more. It is time to start thinking differently and realize that often: less is more. Give them less and give them an offer they can access. I think they are happy to join us! This will be a great opportunity for them to show off their knowledge. Later, of course, they become equal. But the point is that they have overcome the barrier to entry, which is to everyone\u2019s advantage. If you don\u2019t believe ask the Lat-Am guys\u2026 I feel they confirm me, even though I\u2019ve never talked to them about it. ps. No offence, only straight words. For me it\u2019s looks like a waste of money that you organised the Amsterdam event from the US. I would have thought the same thing if Maker had organised the Denver party from the EU. I know there are many arguments for and against it but logic dictates that for cost effectiveness. Maker should use local professionals.  In this case, we are talking about the Netherlands, a pretty developed country, they have everything, it\u2019s only the matter of time and money. But maybe I\u2019m wrong, Im not not a professional party organizer. ",

In my view, a high starting salary is a \u201cbarrier to entry\u201d that significantly narrows the pool of successful applicants.  I am thinking here of a lower starting salary model, followed later by a merit-based catch-up, which would eliminate the initial inequality over time, while at the same time alleviating the barrier to entry mentioned above. Salary is only one component. It seems to me that here at Maker it is the only motivation for attracting new employees. What about the other important, non-negligible factors that Maker offers? If you are not aware of the inhumane and abusive conditions in which some people work, I suggest you read what Goldman Sachs employees can expect in return for high pay: golden handcuffs. High starting salaries can take a psychological toll on employees. It distorts their perception of their salary and prevents them from pursuing a more meaningful career. Moreover, the initial positive effect of high starting salaries soon wears off and they want more. It is not their fault, they are human beings. It is a systemic failure. Of course, what I described here only applies to jobs that can attract a wide range of job seekers from all over the world.  In specialised, \u2018rock star\u2019 professions, the narrow market dictates the high price, and we have to adapt. Last but not least, if we do not want to be unfair, we have to take into account the geographical situation in terms of the cost of living. It is not uniform even within a country, and there are even greater differences in between countries and continents. ",

This would create a more expensive cost of living that, ideally, would be offset by a higher salary.  Remote Companies If your company is remote, your company doesn\u2019t care where you\u2019re based. So you\u2019re competing with the world (more or less).

I agree that location should be just ignored. if you work remotely, all that matters is your performance/quality, not the address of your appartment. This said, there is a reason if most production facilities have moved to China. Designers may work in NY city, but t-shirts are physically producerd are in China. Why? Because you actually need a lot of talent to make a cool t-shirt (I guess\u2026 maybe bad example lol) but you just need cheap labor + economy of scale to produce a sufficiently-high quality t-shirt. So salaries need to be a function of required quality. If \u2018enough\u2019 quality is available for cheaper (as it is for tshirts production/China) then salaries should be lowered.

On the contrary, the vast majority of MakerDAO contributors can work from wherever they want, because the work is digital and their language and professional skills allow them to easily access this global digital market, and they can relatively easily move to other locations if that is still required.   As a result, it\u2019s a misconception to think that contributors are part of their local job markets, misinformed by their physical location. They are part of the global, digital job market that has its own rates. Whether someone works from a beach in Bali or a tiny apartment in the most expensive neighborhood in New York, it\u2019s just not relevant. So the title of the thread is misleading: it\u2019s not about being a global organization. For Coca Cola it would probably be a disastrous business decision to make salaries independent of geography. For MakerDAO, it\u2019s about being a digital-native organization, where physical location is irrelevant to the job. ",

However, while the current MKR bonus is designed to align incentives, it is actually not a performance bonus but a retention bonus. As such they are similar to Restricted Stock Units. It may well be true that options might be better. In the current circumstances with MKR token price dropping since forever, there would be no incentive left and people may have experienced a lower barrier to have moved on. I would also imagine that individual contributors feel quite powerless in steering the MKR price in the face of a crypto bear market. The retention bonus is meant to retain talent also through the bear when things look bleak. Maybe what you would want is to drive people out if the MKR price isn\u2019t appreciating. But it\u2019s not what was intended so that may explain the apparent \u201cobviously bad design choices\u201d ",

Increased volatility means also being overly rewarded when the market moves in your favor too.  So we are only issuing to allow for upside?  There should be no risk in the downside?  Again points to poor understanding of how structure of incentive. I would suspect in a down market people would definitely be staying at the attractive salary levels already being offered.  This is not a retention issue.  I hear no where in the community channels that there is a retention issue within MKR due to compensation.

Unfortunately it is also grossly misrepresenting reality. Literature on the impact of incentives is VAST and anyone with serious experience in designing incentive mechanisms and compensation schemes will tell you there is no perfect solution or obvious bad choices. Issuing options is just another tool to retain and motivate people to generate value for [token] holders, but is far from being perfect. The shortcomings are numerous, e.g.:  Extreme difficulty to price the value of an option for an illiquid or low-liquidity underlying asset Asymmetric upside (a call option equals to a levered stock purchase) leading to vicious incentives to pump up temporarily price - maybe at the expense of risk Non-linear impact on incentives in bear phases where most options go out of the money lowering entry barriers exactly when we need them to retain Inability to impact price for any specific employee  Typically, stock option plans with very clear price targets are issued for top managers where they are the apex of an organisation focused on delivering value for shareholders. Those plans are also MASSIVE, meaning that if you do good you leave with an incredible amount of money. The same cannot, and is typically not applied, to mid-low tier employees. Even traders or investment bankers get their bonus partially in vesting shares, not options. My point is simply to demonstrate that things are difficult when you look at them professionally. There is no easy answer, as there is no obviously flawed behaviour, most of the times. The world is complex, and what matters the most is the good faith and humility of those that are trying to improve the status quo and the tools to reach certain goals. I can personally attest that @SES-Core-Unit is deeply involved in doing so. ",

I think in many cases you will find people at the height of their profession typically living in metropolises where the cost of living is high and all that. So I think people need to be mindful of that when they are analyzing whether compensation is excessive. I understand location as to compensation might not be as relevant in some job fields (as opposed to others).

It\u2019s no secret that people in say Central or South America have a lower cost of living. When recruiting talent, all companies know this. It\u2019s hard to find great talent in this industry. If you find someone, anywhere, we\u2019re all competing for that person using about the same compensation and any local or geographic differences that would have existed in the past do not apply. Now, there are jobs where this might apply but not the types of high demand positions we tend to hire. We have to retain talent as well so that means using incentive models that are very generous. I have debated this over the years and for me, it comes down to, given the dynamics of the industry, supply/demand, etc., what do we think will work today. I can\u2019t predict the future or the price of MKR. When the initial core units were proposed, many saw at those incentives as, look how rich those people are going to get. Today, we sit around $1100 per MKR (from a peak of 6k+) and while it still potentially represents a lot of money for people, it\u2019s what is true, today. There is an equal probability that MKR will moon or dive based upon the performance of the protocol. If we get rugged somehow (and there are PLENTY of opportunities for that esp. with some of the new collateral technologies that carry a lot more risk), those people that received an incentive when hired will receive very little. No one wants that. There is an incentive to both protect AND grow the protocol. It\u2019s not all about growth and that\u2019s important. I don\u2019t see a situation where people are making off with MKR. If someone is hired and supporting a dying protocol, it\u2019s probably out of their individual control and the problems need to be addressed on a different level. I also want to make sure people are being incentivized during bear markets and crypto winters. It\u2019s one of the most important times for a protocol. If we are concerned that people aren\u2019t working or there is a lack of direction/information to know if each CU is adding value, that is a different discussion. In CES, we use industry best practices to manage our processes and work. The visibility is too great for anyone to just hang out and collect a paycheck. Yes, this requires experience to know how to run a business and team. As far as direction, we are a DAO and CES has a mandate. Those two work together. As a DAO, we\u2019ve clearly identified the issue with clear/competing directions and it looks like we\u2019re going to fix this. Having team goals/KPIs is very different when we lack strategic direction. Basically, CUs do the best they can based upon their mandate and what they know to be true about common knowledge. When you add in high level objectives, those goals/KPIs are modified to support the higher level objectives. So when we say a CU isn\u2019t adding value, we need to be careful and understanding why that might be the case. This reply isn\u2019t directed at anyone or a specific reply. Just a collection of thoughts based upon a lot of valuable feedback from others. ",

I wanted to point out that physical location is a major determinant of the quality and quantity of the local workforce through factors such as quality education and health care, but also factors arising from psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social differences. Living in a developed country gives a much better chance of becoming a digital-native workforce. The lack of entry-level, from our perspective, free or low-paid (in developing countries this may even mean sufficient income) contributor jobs that are readily available, significantly reduces the potential labour force base. In the EU, programmes such as Defi-Talents, which is advertised free of charge by Frankfurt Business School, attract hundreds of talented people from all over the world every year and they are first piled with offers from programme partners and sponsors. So these supporter companies are not only competing in the labour market for staff, they are also investing to broaden the pool of people they recruit from. This is a possible path, and an alternative example of this is the path of people who have become active workers through participating in this forum. I know there are such initiatives here, but the question is, we are not choosing the most expensive way to create something that already exists and working well. I think onboard a CU and then offboard, if its don\u2019t perform properly at work is always the most expensive for us. Is it possible to reduce the compensation later? It is a difficult matter because financial loss is more painful for the individual than ever thought. Recognition of this has previously received the Nobel Prize. ",

However, we assume that in the medium to long term the situation may change and the distorting factor of scarcity will ease and the rules of the global labour market will also apply in our market. To offer balanced employment opportunities that provide long-term personal financial development, balanced incentives need to be in place. As a global company, it is worth thinking about how to solve this problem, because there are solutions, such as this one:     Of course, in some crypto-native professions, scarcity today means that we have to enter the ring to attract hard-to-get workers. Let\u2019s not forget that there is ALWAYS someone offering more, so it\u2019s much more likely that tailored packages will keep the workforce here. As the DAO grows, more and more functions will be created that do not require highly specialised crypto-native skills and this should also be taken into account when making or accepting an offer from someone.

It\u2019s very easy to misunderstand especially when we are talking in the context of a possible negative event. Consensus is easier to build in the light of positive events. What I see is that it\u2019s easy to attract a lot of people with high salaries but it\u2019s hard to retain them and get them to work in an efficient, productive, coordinated way. Pay cuts are not an option because they can have very painful consequences for both sides. Therefore, later the significant fixed costs of salaries should be kept under tighter control even when we are in a state of jubilant optimism about a growing market and rising revenues. We are often tempted to attract talent solely on the promise of high pay. I think who comes easy, goes easy when money is all that matters. I\u2019ve tried to mention that high starting salaries are a barrier to entry. It also protects those already in. We need to keep the valuable people in, there\u2019s no question about that. The question is whether it is only the higher salary than competitors or rather a complex and fair reward system with a good company culture and great opportunities that keeps them here? Something that goes beyond salary: a sense of mission and the faith in the development of the DAO.  I know we have a lot of that people here, but we can never have enough good participants and employees. Location-based pay systems can be just a means a way  to index the global salaries to the local cost of living. I think the Geographic Differential Index is just a parameter to take into account the following costs based on geographic location:  Goods and Services Housing Income Tax  I don\u2019t think anything that could happen about it, that would significantly affect Maker\u2019s balance sheet, but this thread illustrates how difficult it is to reconcile differing viewpoints on even a relatively low impact issue. Well let\u2019s practice  DAO brings together a lot of different perspectives, but we need to come up with a common perspective on DAO that is best for DAO as a whole. This viewpoint is unlikely to be fully shared by any of us individually. Some will be more vocal in their opinions, others may not speak the whole time, and that\u2019s OK it will always be that way. But it is important that all points of view are heard, including those who remain silent. So I\u2019m going to be silent here to give others the opportunity to express their views. ",

You can pay through the roof but if you don\u2019t have a mission with purpose, a healthy culture (values, core principles, expected leadership behaviors) and don\u2019t provide an excellent contributor experience in terms of hiring, learning, career mobility etc. your DAO will be nothing more than a revolving door.

It\u2019s a well known tactic of SpaceX to pay slight sub-market rate - it solidifies the idea that your work is not purely your salary, you are fucking working on sending people to space! Same should be though about Maker - you are building the first decentralized credit facility in the world. Its a privilege to work for Maker. The argument I see in the above replies of someone changing protocols because of higher salary levels is thus completely off-base. If a MakerDAO contributor is paid \u201cwell\u201d and gets a better offer somewhere else and accepts it - maybe they weren\u2019t really in it for the long run anyways? So the key here is to find a salary range that is competitive, yet pay slightly under it. ",

Looking at where somebody lives to decide how much their work is worth is not only contrary to the ethos of crypto, pretending to have a group of people working side by side, doing the same or similar jobs, but paying them differently based on where they live, is a terrible idea for an organization. It would also put Maker at a disadvantage considering that some organizations do this, but not all, especially in crypto. I know if Maker offers to pay me less for a certain job because I live in Latam, I\u2019ll try to find another place where this is not the case. The talented people with most options will be the first to go, and the rest would follow as they find better options. Or people would simply refuse to tell Maker where they live.

This article came out recently and has an interesting link about the differences within the OECD.  There is a link to that nice calculator:  Work Abroad Calculator | William Russell And a true digital nomad might want to study that too before picking up his backpack: Cost of living Estimator Unfortunately, it always turns out that if you want to get the same value for the same work, it\u2019s going to be difficult today. And it seems that at the moment the world is not moving in the direction of making those differences disappear. They are sharpening, and believe me, the wage gap is a serious problem within the EU. You can move freely here but few people will move unless there is a real crisis in living standards. So I think digital nomads are the exception, a tiny minority that proves the rule. Equal pay for equal work? From a global perspective, I think this is an overly simplistic formula that does not take into account the important variables that affect individual quality of life beyond income. These include the country\u2019s infrastructural development, housing, health, safety, security, the tax system and last but not least the natural environment such as weather, average temperature, number of hours of sunshine\u2026 \u2026then there are the social and individual variables such as language, culture, local food, \u2026 and so on. There are a lot of parameters that influence quality of life, all of which (should) be taken into account. And everything has a (local)price. It would be better and fairer to have the same quality of life for the same work. ",
