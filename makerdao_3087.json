In general if we can put DAI supply on an upward trajectory it would improve the outlook of MKR. DAI supply peaked before the stability fee was raised from 3.5% to 7.5% around March 21st of this year. The rate has come down from its peak at 20.5% and is now 10.5%, but we are still well out of growth territory. Today, the most-effective return on DAI comes from repaying new CDPs. So, it is no wonder that the supply of DAI is not growing. Current returns on DAI:  Repay CDP: 10.5% dYdX: 8.66% Compound: 8.25% Nexo: 8%  It seems that if we were to lower the stability fee to 7% that we could see a return to upward growth, as DAI is strongly demanded by DeFi, without sacrificing too much revenue.

Dont higher interest rates require increased demand for CDPs (debt) for supply growth? Increased dai holding demand beyond supply available means a movement of the peg above 1$. In that case the stability fee is lowered to spur dai creation to match the over demand. Your post completely ignores the peg braking in the recent past. How can that not be mention in a post relating to lowering stability fee? Sorry to sound harsh but its a real question. In the past cheap debt inflated supply beyond what demand could match and mkr holders had to increase the stability fee to reduce the attractiveness of cdps, thus lowering supply to meet demand. ",
