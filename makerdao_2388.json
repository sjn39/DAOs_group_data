                    "content": "Hi Devs! A cool new feature that came with the launch of Multi-Collateral Dai is the permit function. The permit function allows you to build integrations where the gas fee of transferring Dai can be abstracted away and paid directly in Dai rather than ETH by using relay services. This is very valuable in services where handling both ETH and Dai is cumbersome - for example in a payment service focused on Dai. Therefore the integration team has created a guide that covers exactly how you can use permit and relayers to pay for Dai transfers in Dai. You can read the guide here: How to use permit function and relayers to pay gas for Dai transactions in Dai If you run into issues in this guide, feel free to open an issue or ask questions in this thread  Happy hacking!
