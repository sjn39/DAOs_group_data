The Goerli testnet will continue being maintained and updated. The Ropsten and Rinkeby test networks consist of a deployment made by the Maker Foundation Integrations team. Protocol Engineering has a limited ability to support or maintain these testnet deployments. We will be removing these from the changelog.makerdao.com website to avoid confusion. No shutdown actions will be performed on the test deployments, so existing test integrations will remain unaffected. These deployments are out of date and do not include updates to several core contracts, developers should exercise caution in using them. The Kovan test deployment was officially supported and deprecated in August of 2021 due to Kovan test network reaching end of support in openethereum. Users should migrate test contracts to our Goerli deployment, which we continue to maintain. Affected users can continue using the previous contracts in simulation, however no further updates will be made to those deployments. Developers can simulate tests against our mainnet deployment, switch to Goerli testnet, or deploy a copy of dss in a local testchain using dss-deploy-scripts. ",
