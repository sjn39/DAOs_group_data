We host conferences like Permissionless, have a large editorial team, run a network of podcasts, have one of crypto\u2019s largest newsletters, recently launched Blockworks Research, and more Host of the Empire podcast with Santiago Santos Long-term MKR holder and supporter of MakerDAO   Core Values  Maker is a B2B (or DAO-to-DAO) platform that can serve as the backbone of DeFi Maker should focus on expanding DAI\u2019s market share by building connections with more protocols, both inside and outside of Ethereum Maker must improve its governance and incentives by balancing pragmatic governance with the pressing need for long-term decentralization   Delegate Statement I have strong conviction that DeFi will grow exponentially in the coming decades and that Maker has the opportunity to become the backbone of DeFi. If that happens, MakerDAO will be one of the most impactful initiatives in the history of global finance. To achieve that scale, Maker needs a better growth strategy, improved governance, and more scalable operations. Growth strategy: Expanding DAI\u2019s supply and market share is crucial to making Maker an economically viable protocol at scale. Increasing the DAI supply both increases our total capital available and improves our unit economics. Maker has done incredibly well within the Ethereum community. To distribute DAI more widely, we should integrate with more communities outside of Ethereum. Protocol-specific stables are going to become more and more popular \u2013 we should push to build these relationships and incorporate DAI into other protocols as quickly as possible. We should view DAI as a B2B business where our end customers are other DAOs. With this focused strategy, Maker will become the backbone of DeFi and will utilize other more consumer focused protocols to distribute DAI to their communities. This already exists within ETH-focused protocols; we need to scale this model to other protocols outside of ETH. Doing this in the bear will pay massive dividends in the bull. Governance: There are a couple aspects of Maker governance that are broken. For the solution to these problems, I tend to agree with Hasu\u2019s vision of DAO governance. The first issue is that delegates get paid by the DAO on non-core metrics such as voter participation. This does not set up the DAO for success. We should judge voters on the quality of their decisions, not on the frequency of their votes. The second issue is that Maker only has a few internal leaders. I\u2019m incredibly impressed by how much Maker has achieved without many internal leaders and with very flat governance. However, we\u2019ll be unable to achieve global scale with this model. Maker needs internal leaders who are subject matter experts on niche areas within the DAO. The third issue is that Maker needs better incentives to bring top talent into the protocol. I think of this as the recruiting unit. You would never scale a multi-billion dollar company without a recruiting arm; DAOs are no different. We need both a recruiting unit and a better incentive system to get the best minds in crypto to participate in Maker\u2019s long-term strategy. When it comes to governance, I believe in long-term decentralization of the protocol and believe that one day Maker can run itself with very little oversight. However, in the near term, I will vote on proposals that could look like the best versions of corporate governance if they can improve the long-term scalability, viability, and growth of Maker. Scalable operations: Operations start with culture. Right now, Maker\u2019s culture feels tense and, at times, hostile. To improve Maker\u2019s operations, we have to start by improving Maker\u2019s culture. For example, the relationship between MKR holders and Core Units should be aligned \u2013 there has to be bidirectional trust from both parties. When times get tough, people walk from bad cultures. With amazing culture though, there\u2019s no amount of pain that can tear people apart. That\u2019s the culture Maker should strive to create. Beyond the culture, Maker should use this bear market to improve its processes like budgeting, forecasting, alignment between core units, and internal communications. Regarding budgeting and forecasting, there needs to be a much better process for building budgets and getting approval. Right now, there\u2019s minimal oversight into budgets and, once a budget is put into place, there\u2019s minimal accountability. We should create better budgeting practices with the end goal of building a larger DAI surplus. The growth into other ecosystems (mentioned above) should help with this.  Conflicts of Interest  MKR is one of my largest holdings and I am very strongly aligned with the long-term success of the project. With that being said, I also hold a broad range of tokens including assets from protocols that could be considered competitive to MKR. My role as a recognized delegate of MakerDAO does not influence my role as co-founder of Blockworks, and vice versa. I have read and agree with the Recognized Delegate Code of Conduct.  ",
