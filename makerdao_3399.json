The complexity of the products and undefined regulatory frameworks in major jurisdictions in the cryptocurrency sector means the team has to be diligent communicators capable of executing marketing plans while being mindful of the potential concerns of users and regulators. I am proposing this budget to take the groundwork built by the foundation and drive it forward. My unit ensures MakerDAO reaches its full potential by tapping into new markets and boosting visibility in existing ones. We will be the face of MakerDAO for new users and partners. My team consists of diverse individuals who are multilingual. Their international background and level of experience inject strength and brings value to the team. That diversity is essential as we present Dai as an unbiased currency, and position MakerDAO as a way to unlock financial freedom for anyone, anywhere. The stablecoin market with a $60 billion market cap has surged exponentially in the past year, where Dai accounts for 5 percent of the market share. The team will focus on this fast-growing market and new target growth areas while collaborating with other units in reaching the common goal of bringing Dai to the level of mass adoption.  Core Unit Name Strategic Marcomms  Budget Composition On average, marketing budgets account for about 10 percent of a company\u2019s revenue. Together with the PR communications, they function as revenue drivers. The proposed budget is based on industry data and estimates made after consulting with experts and service providers in finance, accounting, legal, marketing, and PR. The budget encompasses key areas of coverage, and some initiatives such as outreach programs are scheduled to be activated in the second and third quarters. The budget is about 8.2 percent of the Maker protocol\u2019s revenue (based on estimates from the first two months of the year), below the 10 percent average. The below-average estimate is made regardless of additional costs unique to MakerDAO units, such as legal consultation and the team\u2019s operation cost. A lower than average budget shows that the unit is ambitious, ready to execute its plan, and simultaneously realistic of what can be achieved in one year. Budget Breakdown People: This budget ensures that MakerDAO attracts and retains creative and diligent professionals to reach new markets and users. The estimates are within the compensation range in reports published by major HR consulting agencies based on job levels and experience. The table below gives an overview of the number of people that plan to join the unit, and the number of people we need to hire.  Marketing includes consultants focusing on marketing, events, and community building. PR & Communications include specialists on social media, content, and media outreach. The unit plans to add nine more people to fill out marketing-related roles such as SEO, email and social media marketing channels, and outreach. The budget also includes a couple of freelancers to ensure the team is agile in achieving our goals. We aim to fill these roles by the first quarter with help from recruiters.      People Current To hire     Facilitator 1    PR & Communications 2 4   Marketing 3 3   Freelancers  2    Marketing & PR: This budget covers upcoming marketing campaigns, advertising, and cost for hiring PR agencies in locations we identify as top markets that can provide relatively high ROI. It also includes joint campaigns with potential partners in major markets such as the U.S, Japan, EU regions. The budget also ensures we sponsor the most significant events and host educational and exciting events for potential users. The budget also includes content that is educational, relatable, easy for potential users to read while further strengthening our already-established position in the DeFi and Web 3 space. The content will be in the form of blog posts and audios. Outreach Programs: This budget includes the initiatives listed below that are aimed at reaching out to new audiences.  Ambassador program Translation Market research Community management  Administration: This budget is for daily operation, recruitment fees, accounting, IT subscriptions, and recruitment so the unit can focus on fulfilling their mandate. It also includes traveling for the team on speaking engagement post COVID. Legal & Consultation: This budget ensures the unit has a global legal counsel on retainer, in addition to hiring counsels for crucial jurisdictions such as the U.S., Japan, and the EU. Incentives: A 20 percent is added to the category of People to provide an incentive for the team members to achieve their deliverables. The unit is interested in MKR vesting being discussed by the community. We support such a framework and await the outcome of MKR-related discussions for MakerDAO units. We plan to change our incentive structure accordingly after the governance community reaches its conclusion.

On People, the team members are hired as contractors, given that we are just starting. Contractors usually cost 20% more than the estimated range of salary. That comes down to 1.19 million DAI. Then, I included 20% as incentives if we reach our key results, bringing the total to 1.4 million. The 272k budget on admin-related cost includes the cost of setting up a company, accounting reporting, gas fee, wire transfer, auditor, travel expense, and recruiting fee. Half of the group were confirmed at the time of the estimate, and half weren\u2019t. Therefore, I included 30% on the estimated salary for the cost of hiring a recruiter for the rest of the team because I would like to get everything started as soon as we launch. ",

The only way you\u2019re going to have instant access to those funds is if they are in a multi-sig that you guys control. Any other mechanism is going to have a delay and need to pass one or more governance votes. I\u2019m not sure how easy it will be to sell that to the community though. Personally I\u2019d recommend putting any such request up to an on-chain poll in the weekly governance cycle.     Kathleen:  Date: The first day of every month from June   Because funds are currently distributed via executive vote, we can\u2019t guarantee timing to this extent. The current setup is for monthly budget payouts to be included in the first weekly executive vote of the month. In practice this means the payment could arrive any-time in the first two weeks of the month (depending on how the executive lines up on the calendar, how quickly it is passed by governance and what the GSM pause delay is set to. As an example for June. The executive would go up on June 4th and would presumably pass and be executed sometime before June 11th. ",

I understand the community values transparency. The thinking behind this is our ability to grab an opportunity when presented to us instead of writing out a budget-modifying proposal that requires details that we want to, but can\u2019t share.   Transparency and MKR making the calls are indeed core values of MakerDAO in my view. You are asking to be able to spend more than 10% of the annual expenses of MakerDAO (15% of the Surplus Buffer) without wanting to discuss with governance because it\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d?

Perhaps provide a hypothetical example on what it would be used for, why, how you would after the fact measure the success of it, and what kind of reporting would occur to the DAO (even if the DAO was not privy to the specifics of the deal prior to deployment of funds) Edited to add: Could you walk us through what a typical work week looks like in this CU? I\u2019m still trying to understand exactly what services are being provided and how they improve profits or expand the reach of DAI.

The % may be reasonable for a traditional company, but MakerDAO does not fit in that peer group. I suspect marketing budgets for most crypto platforms are much lower than what\u2019s stated here. How are we evaluating the impact of our direct marketing spend and identifying what works and what doesn\u2019t work?   Why are our Admin and Legal expenses so high? Either other Core Units are underestimating these costs or your proposal has too large of a budget. The admin and legal expenses are more than every other Core Unit combined. Would appreciate more detail here.   As requested by others, could you please provide an example of a moonshot opportunity that we took advantage of in the past or what one would look like? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Governance\u2019s best interest to have no transparency for such a large amount of DAI. Any single marketing campaign that costs greater than 1M DAI should be approved by Governance, IMO.   ",

                    "content": "    LongForWisdom:  Personally I\u2019d recommend putting any such request up to an on-chain poll in the weekly governance cycle.   Thanks for the suggestion. After considering it carefully, I believe it is best for the Strategic Marcomms unit to go ahead with the budget as proposed which includes the moonshot fund. It should be handled in the same way as the budget implementation.     LongForWisdom:  The current setup is for monthly budget payouts to be included in the first weekly executive vote of the month. In practice this means the payment could arrive any-time in the first two weeks of the month (depending on how the executive lines up on the calendar, how quickly it is passed by governance and what the GSM pause delay is set to.   Thanks for the explanation. I see the growth unit has the date set on the first ten days of each month. We will do the same.     SebVentures:  Transparency and MKR making the calls are indeed core values of MakerDAO in my view.   Seb, that understanding is precise, I believe, and I have also stated that in one of my previous replies in case you missed it.     SebVentures:  You are asking to be able to spend more than 10% of the annual expenses of MakerDAO (15% of the Surplus Buffer) without wanting to discuss with governance because it\u2019s \u201cconfidential\u201d?   \u201cWithout wanting to\u201d is putting words in my mouth. The issue here is finding a solution when urgency and confidentiality are necessary to achieve our goals. Signing confidentiality agreements and acting swiftly on windows of opportunity are some vital business practices for success that we can\u2019t ignore just because we are a DAO.  If we are willing to look at an issue clearly, and think about what\u2019s best for the DAO, then that\u2019s likely to lead us to a solution.     PaperImperium:  Is there an example of how this 5,000,000 DAI moonshot fund would ideally be deployed?   PaperImperium, the unit\u2019s two key objectives are:  Increasing the awareness of Dai and the Maker Protocol Boosting Dai adoption through promotions and partnerships  We want to act on a campaign proposal that is deemed with high ROI for awareness and exposure. The metrics differ depending on the type of campaign. In the case of FTX\u2019s naming rights of the Miami NBA stadium, the measurement would include:  An estimate of media exposure Total number of impressions (Or eyeballs) Traffic to the FTX site User growth A total number of FTX goods sold for merchandise branding The number of mentions associated with FTX\u2019s name  The proposition would have to justify the reported cost of $135 million over 19 years, which comes down to about $7 million a year. The reality is that the details of measurement above probably won\u2019t ever be shared. In our case, after a campaign is introduced to the public, we should and be able to share some details regarding the ROI and other data to the extent agreed upon with our potential partners. I am not saying buying naming rights is how we want to spend our moonshot fund, but that is one example of getting seen and known by a target audience beyond crypto. Apple\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d TV ads and AOL\u2019s free trial CDs are some excellent examples of how we can creatively approach our target audience. Apple\u2019s ad touches people in so many ways without a word on computers. AOL\u2019s CD campaign successfully onboarded millions of users. They differ in the form of ads/marketing campaigns, but their success is achieved by aiming higher and the willingness to take risks.     flipflopflapdelegate:  However, we do need a success measuring technique. And @Kathleen I will be the first community member to defend your Team and that 10% of revenues is needed for your Core Unit budget\u2014but the lack of clarification of how the 5M DAI for Moonshot is not being disclosed properly to the community and that unfortunately has some folks here concerned.   Yes, I see why some people can be concerned and appreciate the opportunity to explain more in detail. All discussion on this moonshot fund is based on a hypothetical scenario that the unit deems as an opportunity that can potentially provide great ROI on exposure and recognition. The team and I feel responsible for finding solutions for problems that we foresee coming. To all the people that have commented on this thread, I appreciate your input and understand your concerns. I know this budget seems high, but keep in mind that the 10% average I cited in the budget proposal is average. Some companies that are aggressive on marketing have a higher budget that\u2019s nearly one-fifth of their revenue. This issue we have discussed isn\u2019t just about Strategic Marcomms\u2019s moonshot budget. It is about how the DAO can be effective, agile, and competitive even when the standard business practice requires NDAs and the right timing. The moonshot fund gives my unit more, not less pressure and responsibility to execute. We don\u2019t plan to aim low because this is what it takes to achieve success. ",

And do you see MakerDAO like other crypto platforms? I am genuinely curious in your views.     Aes:  How are we evaluating the impact of our direct marketing spend and identifying what works and what doesn\u2019t work?   I have addressed this in the proposal thread. We have a set of deliverables. That will have to be reviewed on a regular basis to be effective.     Aes:  Why are our Admin and Legal expenses so high?   The expense includes:  The gas fee (which by itself can be high and unpredictable). Bank transfer Setting up a company Accounting-related costs Travel expense for conferences  The legal fee is necessary as we consult with lawyers in major jurisdictions. We do not jeopardize the future of MakerDAO and the status of DAI and MKR by market and conduct campaigns in locations that deemed such acts as inappropriate or illegal. Other units wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that issue.     Aes:  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Governance\u2019s best interest to have no transparency for such a large amount of DAI. Any single marketing campaign that costs greater than 1M DAI should be approved by Governance, IMO.   My team and I share the same belief with you. That\u2019s our starting point. However, we also see this as a potential problem that the DAO has to address sooner or later. It is ideal if we can achieve both transparency and effectiveness.
