As part of that, we have built a Karma reputation dashboard  to show Optimism governance participant activity in snapshot, on-chain voting and forum activity. To see the forum activity, governance participants have to link their forum handle/username to their wallet. This will help us associate forum activity to that wallet and boost your reputation score. We would like to use this Topic for governance participants to sign a message using their wallet and post it here so we can link. If you are interested in seeing all your activity, please link your forum handle to your wallet here. ",
