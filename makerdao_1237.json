We have been working closely with Centrifuge and communicating with the RWF Core Unit regularly to come up with a mutually agreeable plan to ask the community for a debt ceiling increase to 100-150mm DAI (final amount TBD at signal request). This is an informal poll to allow the RWF team to engage in due diligence and legal negotiations (counsel cost to be borne by New Silver) prior to the formal DC signal request. Note: This poll is not the debt ceiling signal request; this is a poll to ask the community to allow the RWF Core Unit to spend time and resources to engage with New Silver. A formal signal request will be forthcoming after the RWF CU team completes diligence and legal reviews. For additional information, please see New Silver\u2019s recent updates: May, April, March, Focus On #11. Others are available on the forum. Additional Information New Silver is asking the community to allow the RWF Core Unit to dedicate resources to work with New Silver on legal review and perform diligence in connection with New Silver\u2019s upcoming signal request for a debt ceiling increase. Any outside legal counsel costs will be incurred by New Silver. Full details on the request will be forthcoming in the upcoming signal request after this work has been completed. At a high level, these are the tasks that the parties will engage in:  Implement the Trust Indenture legal structure as outlined in this post, as well as its\u2019 required components such as trustee, payment agent, verification agent, custodian. Due diligence review Any other items, as needed  Here are the highlights of a few of New Silver\u2019s achievements:  First and largest RWA Maker Vault At current volumes, earning >600,000 DAI per/year for the Maker community No losses since the start Signed a term sheet for $20mm with a US based institutional lender to provide junior capital New Silver participating in the junior tranche with >4mm DAI at-risk capital Expanded team from 5 to 19 people Brought on a CFO with experience at Goldman Sachs and Paypal Joined U.S. Green Building Council and rolling out green incentives for borrowers     Should the RWF Core Unit allocate time and resources for due diligence and legal for New Silver\u2019s upcoming debt ceiling signal request?  Yes No Abstain     0 voters     Poll will run for 7 days. ",

Please allow me to provide some feedback to the comments   In terms of time commitment, fully defer to the RWF team, but just wanted to add that this will not be a rushed process and sufficient time, in line with the teams\u2019 capacity, will be available.   In terms of diversification, the current DC and the future DC, if approved, would remain sufficiently small compared to Makers TVL. The new DC, if approved, would take about a year to fill, with short term loans coming in and out. With real estate, there is practically no chance of total principal loss, since residential real estate will very unlikely go to 0. There may be a delay in collections, but every state in the US enforces foreclosure. Also, being the first RWA vault on Maker and having \u201ctrailblazed\u201d, together the with the community, on a number of issues, we believe our potential DC increase process will go a long way towards streamlining, optimizing and improving the process for future counterparties. Further, given the existing and potential current RWA pipeline, there should be additional diversification on-line prior to the potential new DC being filled.   In terms of the rising rate environment, we are certainly aware of it and are/have planned for it. The fix and flip space has existed through various downturns and, as research has shown, lenders had minimal defaults (and near 100% total recovery). At this stage, we are not in a real estate crisis, we are in an inflationary period. Real estate may be effected later on, which will likely be a modest price cooling (not a bad thing for New Silvers potential borrowers) and a slowdown in transactions, both of which we are cognizant of. The origination volumes for fix and flip are well over $50b per year, and New Silver is well under 1% of the market share at the moment. We believe this is an opportune time to go to market with a differentiated, attractive, well thought through product, and outcompete and improve on the TradFi backed incumbents. We believe we are in a great position, together with MakerDAO, to do that.   Thank you all again for your time. ",
