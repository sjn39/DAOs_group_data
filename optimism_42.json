As i believe average user interact with YouTube at least once a day. If we have our proposal made in audio/video form on our channel, it will compel user to join our governance & vote. Also, we will post info related to project. So, i propose to create the channel & put step wise guideline for ease of the community. As i believe videos help you retain information longer. ",

It is great for visual and audio learners, allowing folks to multitask. Creating a pipeline to onboard new users and educate existing ones seems beneficial, however, there is a great technical barrier to entry. Knowledge of EVMs and traditional infrastructure (wallets, NFTs, exchanges) is required before transacting on Optimism; it\u2019s difficult to go from \u201czero to hero.\u201d Monitoring expenditures across different DAOs and protocols, marketing is usually ignored. I encourage the development of marketing resources and content production - especially with the use of Web2 tools - but to do so in a cost-conscious matter. ",
