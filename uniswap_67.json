Since there is no liquidity mining, it is hard to make the case that multiple deployments will segment liquidity, and long term if this is an issue governance can flip the switch on liquidity incentives for the chains it desires deepest liquidity. In the meantime, not deploying to new and growing networks like Arbitrum and Matic just allows for other exchanges to come in and fill that spot. This could potentially eat into fees earned by governance in the future.\n\nAlongside this, it will help to grow the potential list of projects that can be built on Uniswap v3. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing with and using the v3 codebase will only expedite Uniswap adoption on all chains as the code and integrations become more battle tested.\n\nArbitrum launches later this week on May 28th. I think it would be best to start a discussion ASAP around deploying the Uniswap v3 code to Arbitrum network.\n\n### Next Steps\nIndicate your interest for Uniswap moving forward with a deployment of Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum, by (1) opening the Uniswap v3 license to include code deployed on Arbitrum, (2) allowing community developers to implement Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum.\n",

In my opinion it would be good for Uniswap with regards to L2, Arbitrum is an alternative implementation of an optimistic rollup with different design principles and thus tradeoffs. Optimism can automatically follow Ethereum hardforks but Arbitrum has far less risk of reaching a non-deterministic state and it can be used with the same contract bytecode as used for Ethereum L1 contracts. We can\u2019t know yet which one is going to be more attractive for developers, if Uniswap decides to only integrate with Optimism and Arbitrum becomes the most popular rollup then we could leave a big void that will be filled by a competitor. Last but not least, Arbitrum is launching the 28 of May and we don\u2019t know when Optimism is launching, deploying v3 to Arbitrum will mitigate in a short timeframe the \u201chigh gas fees\u201d bad publicity Uniswap is having without requiring practically any contract changes from the dev team.

While I agree that Uniswap shouldn\u2019t chase every side-chain out there, I do think Arbitrum has solid potential to be one of the primary Ethereum scaling solutions, operating alongside Optimism. Arbitrum will have a version of Uniswap on it, either a fork of V2 or an anonymous fork of V3. I believe it is in the best interest of UNI holders, as well as the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, for there to be an officially-supported instance of Uniswap V3 deployed to Arbitrum. ",

If the overall community too supports this proposal, this proposal will serve as a strong litmus test for whether Uniswap governance will be able to respect the wishes of the community. There have been rumours that Uniswap investors such as Paradigm and a16z will be reluctant to deploy Uniswap to Arbitrum due to vested financial interest in Optimism. Deploying Uniswap to Arbitrum will quash these rumours and strongly signal that the there is no misalignment of goals amongst the various investors, funds, and individuals invested in Uniswap. Uniswap should aim to be public infrastructure and deploy itself wherever possible. This is simultaneously also the path to maximising revenue. Projects such as Sushiswap and Aave have already soft-signalled intentions to deploy to Arbitrum, this indicates that a vibrant DeFi ecosystem is going to grow on Arbitrum, whether we are prepared for it or not. Uniswap v3 has a competitive moat due to its licensed codebase and capital efficient model, it must take full advantage of this. Not deploying to all chains could be interpeted as some as an action undertaken in bad faith, this in turn could lead to someone not respecting the license and forking the codebase. To conclude, I can\u2019t think of a single reason why the broader community should not want Uniswap deployed on Arbitrum. I would specifically request the Uniswap team and lead engineers - Hayden Adams, Noah Zinsmeister, Dan Robinson and anyone else involved - to let the community know if and how such a deployment could take place, and any roadblocks they may face. Such information would be helpful as we head towards an official vote. ",

We would use a publicly claimed Uni deployer address and a custom written deployer contract (with the Uni deployer whitelisted on it) to achieve this trustless incentivizer. The funds would stay on L1 and only be unlocked by a valid L2ToL1Message from Arbitrum.

I\u2019d like to briefly explain the mechanics of what an on-chain governance action to accomplish this proposal would look like. As explained in the V3 announcement post, the V3 source code may not be used in a commercial or production setting for up to 2 years after launch without appropriate permission. However, additional use grants can be made via changes to v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth. Since Uniswap governance owns uniswap.eth, it\u2019s possible for governance to create a text record at this subdomain indicating that a V3 deployment on the Arbitrum Mainnet which appropriately gives control over the factory owner address to Uniswap governance is not in violation of the license. If this action passed, any deploy that met the criteria could become the canonical V3 on Arbitrum. It might be desirable to coordinate this deployment process with the Uniswap Labs team, so that (for example) the factory addresses on all canonical deploys would continue to be identical, as well as the Arbitrum team, for any technical issues that may arise.

Initial idea by the Uniswap core team was to wait for Optimism to be ready and launch Uniswap v3 there (Optimism is also L2 scaling based on rollups). Arbitrum launches May 28th and community started the incentive to deploy Uniswap v3 there. Why rollups? Rollups will allow users to use Uniswap in environment where fees will be much lower than they are on Ethereum chain (L1) Please explain rollups in 2 minutes, preferably with pictures sure: https://youtu.be/BgCgauWVTs0?t=452 How can Uniswap be deployed to Arbitrum? Deploy Uniswap v3 to Arbitrum Mainnet - #24 by Noah Will Arbitrum deployment use liquidity from pools on Ethereum chain? No. It is separate deployment which means separate pools. How big of a performance upgrade can we expect?* Not an expert on this topic but based on my research rollups can scale around 100x if all transactions in a rollup are simple payments. However since average Uniswap transaction is ~5x more gas hungry than a simple payment we can probably expect around 15-20x? (I would love someone more knowledgeable to answer this) How much lower will the fees be?* Assuming you already transferred some of your funds to L2 fees can be as low as 10% of those on L1. However, \u201cbridging\u201d liquidity in itself to any L2 is quite gas hungry. Bridging liquidity to L2?* Yes. Assuming v3 is deployed on Arbitrum, in order for your to use that deployment you will have to bridge some of your funds to Arbitrum. Only then you will be able to use Arbitrum deployment. How do I get my funds back to the chain?* You have to bridge it back. Rollups are notorious for this process being pretty slow. Not sure what is expected delay for Arbitrum. EDIT1: joined Offchain Labs community to try and find out some more details about how Arbitrum deployment would potentially look for an end user. Couple interesting details Delay for getting your funds from Arbitrum back to L1 chain is 7 days Gas cost for getting ETH onto Arbitrum is 70k gas. That is gas cost of ~0.5 swaps on the L1 (Uniswap v3 swap is around 120k-150k gas) *I would love if someone could expand more on last 4 questions. I think that\u2019d be very valuable info. I just know the basics. Feel free to tell me correct answers and I\u2019ll update. I think these are the interesting questions an average user might have. ",

The uniswap governance cannot actually control the uniswap.eth ENS name, because it is owned by an EOA: 0x42D44cC7435CCF5DBDfD59e01fe9f4d306365C7A. This EOA needs to do one of several things to give uniswap governance control of the uniswap.eth name, so that the governance can create the v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth subdomain:  call setApprovalForAll(...) on ENSRegistryWithFallback   This would make uniswap timelock contract an operator of the uniswap.eth node, allowing it to create subdomains. Alternatively,  call setSubnodeRecord(...) directly from the EOA to create the subdomain, instead of requiring the governance to do so  This would need to be followed up with,  call setAuthorisation(...) on ENSPublicResolver2, setting the uni timelock as authorized on the newly created v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth subdomain.  As it is, the uniswap governance has no power to issue licenses as detailed in V3 announcement post. In other words, the uniswap license is currently centralized by this EOA! I\u2019ve since updated the proposal repository. Take note of this line, which is the only way I could get the proposal to execute. It took me quite a while to dig through etherscan, ENS, etc. to solve this problem. ",

If we are going to as a community support a brand new platform that is not battle-tested, we should be:  EXTREMELY confident in the security of the platform. Given that confidence, we should put the weight of our bug bounty programs behind it by extending it such that if there is a bug in Arbitrum, that results in loss of LP funds, that is eligible for the full reward ($500k, soon to be $1.5m I believe).  One of Uniswap\u2019s benefits is their exceptional track record. It falls on the community to ensure that an underlying platform we deploy on isn\u2019t an extreme risk for general users. I imagine a lot of people in this thread are both UNI holders and uniswap exchange users. As uni holders, we have an obligation to make the best decisions possible for the broad set of users. This includes evaluating the safety of a particular platform. The only thing worse than not deploying is deploying and people losing serious amounts of money. I have faith in the Arbitrum team\u2019s execution, but it won\u2019t be battle-tested for some time. They have undergone audit, but it is a very complex, built from scratch, L2 node + contracts. Anyway, food for thought ",
