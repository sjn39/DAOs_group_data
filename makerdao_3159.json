                    "content": "This post is intended to offer a broader discussion on strategies MakerDAO members see fit for maintaining the ability for smaller vaults to exist. You may want to check out the conversation on the Bite Rebate Poll to inform the discussion here. The Signal Request to Increase the Dust Parameter is expected to be finalized by on-chain voting next week, raising the Dust Parameter (minimum DAI debt per vault) to 2,000 DAI. The security of the protocol is paramount, which helps explain why the Dust Parameter was just 20 DAI in August of last year and will now (probably) be 2,000 DAI just five months later. If we do not put together a plan that allows for liquidations to be preformed more cheaply, our Community will be at the mercy of Gas prices and ETH appreciation, preventing many valuable operations from people not currently in our community. I will use one last wall of text here to briefly explain why this issue is so near and dear to me. Put simply, I would not be here contributing to this vibrant and supportive community if I had found out about Maker even a couple weeks later than I did. For me, being able to test the vaults by borrowing the minimum (at the time) of 100 DAI was paramount for me being able to understand and trust the system with more of my assets. Less than a week after opening my testing vaults, the Dust Paramater was increased to 500 DAI, prompting me to join the community and start posting on the forum. I am constantly grateful that I found MakerDAO mere days before it might have slipped away from me, as I now consider this community a home and a welcome personal obsession. Seeing as the dangers of a higher Dust Parameter include:  inability for new users to \u201ctest\u201d vaults at reasonable risk levels a barrier to entry in the DAO for contributors with less capital effectively pricing out users with a native currency weak to USD diverting market share to platforms (like Aave and Compound) without high minimums more concentrated positions from individual vault users making compatible \u201cpartner\u201d solutions like B.Protocol more difficult to manage  And a variety of different vectors for solutions have been suggested like:  rebating keepers that call bite on undercollateralized vaults incorporating a Layer 2 solution to cut down on expenses expanding partnerships with groups like B.Protocol that offer committed liquidators updating Liquidations2.0 to be more efficient for liquidating smaller vaults moving small undercollateralized vaults to an ETH reserve fund hiring someone to manually preform bite calls  I think it\u2019s time we start aggregating and discussing what might be a reasonable path forward. There are reasonable concerns about bandwidth and development cost, but I firmly believe the amount of vault users and contributors to MakerDAO we will gain in the long run by investing into a solution will cover those costs ten-fold. Thanks for reading and please drop your thoughts below! If you like an idea you\u2019ve already seen in the forum, I suggest giving a tag or a linkback to draw in some discussion! ",

Swap should be the cheapest options to liquidate. Over x back to doutch auction as we currently do. Amount under the attack vector can be calculated if we own the liquidity and know the swap fees. For the actual kick of the auction either we incitive people to start the auction via some reward or we loop on those specific vault during the price changes. Also on another hand the attack describe is not really applicable as the attaquant needs to show it is game way before the attack. And it is visible we would pass from 20k vaults to 1M vaults. At that time if we increase the dust the attaquant is the attacked as he needs to pay a lot of gas to exist its position. Or I missed something but this attack needs a lot of capital with a big chance of losing it. Actually, would taking a position on gas saving token more profitable. ",

But the liquidation of the liquidators will be simply to move them the underwater position. Meaning they will have a big vault, and it will be their responsibility to keep it solvent. It does not mean that user vault will automatically go to them, only when user vault get under water. However, this process is much cheaper gas wise. As for small positions they don\u2019t need to hedge. And not auction mechanism is triggered. This is why lower dust level could be supported there. ",

With B.Protocol the process will be cheaper (when b.protocol is the one who liquidate). If B.Protocol liquidators go default, then maker keepers will have to liquidate a big vault (the liquidator\u2019s vault). But in any case, the ceiling of ETH-C should be such that Maker feels comfortable letting B.Protocol hadle. So say it allows initially $5m ceiling. Then an attacker cannot have bigger debt, even if he splits it to small vaults. Answering your question about supporting only small vaults. For us, as a business model it is not very appealing, as the motivation to support small Vaults is the hope the user will eventually increase his vault after he try it out for a while. A model where Maker changes its liquidation process in ETH-A, and send us all underwater small vaults for us to liquidate, would make sense. But requires much more effort on Maker side. ",

Imvho that is totally okay.     prose11:  One downside here is that Maker doesn\u2019t get the visibility, Yield Protocol does. Check them out!   yepp, just looking at the price of MKR in the last year we have not gained anything from the yield-craze. But I don\u2019t worry about it too much, actually I am happy if other products just utilize our product (DAI). I still would like to have Maker as inclusive as possible, so we should definitely review the dust as soon as Liq2.0 gets deployed ",

I think at the end we need to start focusing in a L2 solution in the short-middle term, as well with liquidations 2.0 and wait for ETH 2.0 in the long term \u2026 ",
