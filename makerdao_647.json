The Maker Operational Manual went live not even two weeks in. @gov-comms-core-unit and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit presented a recap of 2021 and brought to light many projects and initiatives planned for 2022. Shortly after, the DAO underwent its first significant and public challenge with the MIP41c5 (Facilitator Offboarding) framework as controversy and discussion arose in response to the offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit. This event resulted in various ideas for improving offboarding, governance, and delegation. The Delegate Compensation Trial completed its 3-month trial period in January. There was a signal request to further extend the trial period for another six months or until MIP61 is approved. We finished the month with one more potential Delegate, @Hasu, throwing his hat in the ring as the 10th Recognized Delegate along with 12 Shadow Delegates totaling almost 100,000 MKR delegated! The overall cryptocurrency market fell sharply towards the end of the month, resulting in the largest wave of liquidations to date. The protocol held up well and collected 15.5MM in penalty fees; The @Risk-Core-Unit published a detailed analysis on the Collateral and Surplus Auctions throughout Flappy Friday. An urgent signal request was published to temporarily suspend Surplus Auctions and MKR burn, which successfuly passed. Additionally, the MakerDAO Open Market Committee took action to advise lowering stability fees and rates across the board for non-stable-assets and LP-vault-types to help stimulate DAI minting, which successfully passed. The community has began looking forward to potential changes to help improve the protocol in the case of similar future events. However, the path forward is still unclear; a large amount of the community believes that we should significantly increase the surplus buffer, and others suggest to continue burning MKR. Check out \u2018What\u2019s Ahead?\u2019 found below for insight on what to expect in February!  Key Outcomes  Temporarily Prevent Surplus Auctions and MKR Burn As per this urgent signal request, the following changes were made through an executive vote:  The existing System Surplus Buffer lerp function was disabled. The System Surplus Buffer parameter was set to 250 million DAI.  This change was proposed to temporarily prevent surplus (flap) auctions until the auction/burn mechanism can be improved. Further details on this issue and the origin of this proposal can be found below:  Flappy Friday - CLIP and FLAP Analysis So is someone going to say anything about yesterday\u2019s FLAP auctions? Stop MKR Burning   Maker Improvement Proposals The month of January contained 11 ratification polls, which have all passed:     Ratification Poll Discussion     Modify Core Unit Budget, ORA-001 (Oracle Gas Costs) Discussion   Onboarding Tech-Ops Core Unit (TECH-001) Discussion   Strategic Finance Core Unit (SF-001) Discussion   Collateral Offboarding Process (MIP62) Discussion   Core Unit Budget, SNE-001 (MIP40c3-SP47) Discussion   Bug Bounty Program for MakerDAO Critical Infrastructure (MIP64) Discussion   Maker Keeper Network (MIP63) Discussion   Offboarding Content Production Core Unit (MKT-001) Discussion   Facilitator Onboarding for RWF-001 (MIP41c4-SP27) Discussion   Development & UX Core Unit Budget - DUX-001 (MIP40c3-SP52) Discussion   Modify Core Unit Budget - Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES-001) (MIP40c3-SP55) Discussion     Parameter Management View a detailed breakdown of the rate change proposal here published by the MOMC.  1830\u00d7643 174 KB   Debt Floor (dust) Management     Vault Type Parameter Previous New Change     UNIV2DAIETH-A Debt Floor 15,000 DAI 60,000 DAI +45,000 DAI   UNIV2USDCETH-A Debt Floor 15,000 DAI 60,000 DAI +45,000 DAI   UNIV2WBTCDAI-A Debt Floor 15,000 DAI 60,000 DAI +45,000 DAI   UNIV2WBTCETH-A Debt Floor 15,000 DAI 25,000 DAI +10,000 DAI   UNIV2UNIETH-A Debt Floor 15,000 DAI 25,000 DAI +10,000 DAI     Stability Fee Management     Vault Type Parameter Previous New Change     ETH-A Stability Fee 2.75% 2.5% -0.25%   WSTETH-A Stability Fee 4.0% 3.0% -1.0%   GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Stability Fee 1.0% 0.5% -0.5%     Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) Management     Vault Type Parameter Previous New Change     LINK-A Maximum Debt Ceiling 140M DAI 100M DAI -40M DAI   YFI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling 130M DAI 50M DAI -80M DAI   UNI-A Maximum Debt Ceiling 50M DAI 25M DAI -25M DAI   UNIV2UNIETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling 20M DAI 5M DAI -15M DAI   GUSD-A Maximum Debt Ceiling 5M DAI 0 DAI -5M DAI   AAVE D3M Maximum Debt Ceiling 100M DAI 220M DAI 120M DAI   GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Maximum Debt Ceiling 10M DAI 500M DAI 490M DAI     Target Borrow Rate (bar) & Available Debt (gap) Management     Vault Type Parameter Previous New Change     AAVE D3M Target Borrow Rate 3.9% 3.75% -0.15%   AAVE D3M Target Available Debt 25M DAI 50M DAI +25M DAI     Liquidation Ratio Management     Vault Type Parameter Previous New Change     GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio 105% 102% -3%    For more information on the GUNIV3DAIUSDC2-A Liquidation Ratio Reduction, see this thread on the MakerDAO Forum.  Core Unit Budget and Vesting  Core Unit DAI Budget Transfers As per multiple successful budget proposals, a total of 10,070,519 DAI were transferred to four Core Units:     Core Unit DAI Amount Budget Proposal     Oracles 6,966,070 DAI Proposal   Oracles 1,805,407 DAI Proposal   TechOps 1,069,250 DAI Proposal   StarkNet Engineering 229,792 DAI Proposal     Core Unit DAI Budget Streams As per multiple successful budget proposals, a total of 11,017,146 DAI are streamed to five Core Units over the next 6-12 months:     Core Unit DAI Amount Budget Proposal     Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling 5,844,444 DAI Proposal   TechOps 2,486,400 DAI Proposal   Development and UX 1,934,300 DAI Proposal   Strategic Finance 494,502 DAI Proposal   StarkNet Engineering 257,500 DAI Proposal     Core Unit MKR Vesting Streams As per the Strategic Finance Core Unit successful MKR budget proposal, a total of 480 MKR will be vested to members of the Strategic Finance Core Unit over the next three years:     Core Unit Member MKR Amount     Aes 240 MKR   SebVentures 240 MKR     Revoking Content Production DAI Budget As a result of this successful budget proposal, the Content Production Core Unit budget was revoked. Note that when a token stream is revoked, it will prevent new tokens from accruing to the recipient but will still allow access to tokens that have already accrued.  Replacing the Real World Finance DAI Budget Stream Given that the facilitator for the Real World Finance Core Unit has changed, we received a request from the new facilitator to adjust the implementation of the existing Real-World Finance DAI budget stream. This request is detailed here. Given that this is an administrative change and budget amounts remain the same, governance facilitators elected to include it in this executive proposal. The executive proposal passed, and the following occurred:  The existing Real-World Finance DAI budget stream will be revoked. A replacement stream will be set up, streaming 1,705,000 DAI to 0x96d7b01Cc25B141520C717fa369844d34FF116ec starting at 2022-02-01 and ending at 2022-12-31.   Delegate Compensation Payments - December: As per these successful governance polls (1, 2) and the ongoing trial of delegate compensation, a total of 48,290 DAI was distributed to seven recognized delegates as detailed below:     DAI Transferred Delegate     12,000 DAI FlipFlopFlap Delegate LLC   12,000 DAI schuppi   12,000 DAI Feedblack Loops LLC   8,597 DAI MakerMan   2,203 DAI ACREinvest   791 DAI JustinCase   699 DAI GFX Labs    Details on the breakdown of delegate compensation for December can be found on the MakerDAO forum here.  Recover DAI from Optimism Escrow:  10 million DAI will be transferred to forum user @lost_some_dai. For further information, please see the initial Signal Request on the MakerDAO forum here.    Protocol Engineering Housekeeping The on-chain changelog, also known as the chainlog, was updated to include the CLIP_FAB contract. This proposed change is part of ongoing Protocol Engineering housekeeping efforts and does not directly affect the Maker Protocol.  Community Greenlight Polls Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. Community greenlight polls occur at fixed times each governance cycle, starting on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month and run for two full weeks. There were seven community greenlight polls during January. Two polls, OGN and RBLD, have passed. STABLE-TBILL and STABLE-NOTE are currently on-chain, which end February 7th at 4 PM UTC and are both leading options are No (Defer) as the time of this publication.

Show some love to our Medium account    Governance Summary  Votes and Polls March had less governance activity than usual, partly due to not having an executive vote on March 18. One poll that passed but has not yet been bundled into an executive vote is the Ambassadors Pilot Program governed by Kat, which has the objective of making Spanish translations of all evergreen resources available to the public. Eleven ratification polls took place in March and successfully passed. There were no Community Greenlight polls. Check out Key Outcomes below for additional details on Polls and Votes.  Financials and Budgets The month started with Strategic Finance presenting their Quarterly Strategy Review of Q4 2021. Discussion on improving workforce spending vs. protocol revenue continues to gain traction, and community members provide their opinions (1, 2, and 3) on potential concerns and solutions. There was an Issue Discussion Call about the Budget Modification Process to engage public discussion, invite questions, and introduce the MIP40 Reform Proposal. Check out the video and Medium summary for more information. 397,184 Dai was transferred to two Core Units: Collateral Engineering Services and Immunefi Security. In addition, a total of 397,184 Dai was streamed to the Collateral Engineering Services, Immunefi, and Risk Core Units. Additional information on Core Unit budget activity is displayed below in the Key Outcomes section.  Delegation and Compensation March includes two new Recognized Delegates. Please welcome Flipside Crypto and Hasu.  End of March delegate summary:   image952\u00d7595 92.4 KB    Tokenomics Discussions and tokenomic challenges within the DeFi space have sparked several proposals for improving MKR tokenomics to increase governance participation, governance security, user incentivization, and the fundamental value of the MKR token.  monet-supply submits a proposal idea for stkMKR: Maker Staking and Tokenomics Revision. There is also a Focus On call recording with monet-supply available on YouTube. Porter_Smith submits a Tokenomics Proposal Overview.   Collateral and RWA March saw multiple discussions on the forum and public calls concerning strategies, clarifications, and improvements in the onboarding process for new collateral assets and real-world assets (RWAs).  monkey.irish submitted a post clarifying the collateral onboarding process. Frank_Brinkkemper submitted a discussion and informal poll around actions to increase the competitiveness of ETH & stETH collateral.  Governance and Risk Call | Ep. 181 featured an open discussion around RWA collateral management. roollie submits a posted exploring the RWA DeFi ecosystem beyond onboarding collateral. The Lending Oversight Core Unit (LOVE) posted their Core Unit overview and incubation update, which includes improved assessment and workflow for collateral applications. lyt from the Strategic Finance Core Unit posted a short comparison of stETH lending markets on Maker vs. Aave.   Core Unit Activity The month finished with 19 active Core Units. The MakerShop Core Unit has stepped down and is discussing a potential mandate handover to Andrew Burban of the Strategic Happiness Core Unit or another team happy to take over. It has been two months since the complete offboarding of the Content Production Core Unit. GovAlpha submitted a post mortem containing a timeline of activities and recommendations for the entire offboarding process.  Governance and Risk Calls Governance and Risk Calls pre-semi-transcription summaries can now be found on the GovComms Medium Channel.  Governance and Risk | Ep. 183 Governance and Risk | Ep. 184   Check out \u2018What\u2019s Ahead?\u2019 below for insights on what to expect in April!  Key Outcomes All votes mentioned are assumed to have successfully passed unless otherwise noted.   Initial Parameters for StarkNet Simple DAI Bridge The community supported implementing a Starknet simple bridge limit of 5 million DAI. The Starknet Engineering Core Unit will proceed with deploying the StarkNet simple bridge once the listed requirements are met.  More Information  The bridge limit is the maximum amount of Dai that can be in the L1 bridge contract. Hence, it is the maximum amount that users can lose. This will not include the Fast Withdrawals component, which is planned for release later this year and will be put through a separate governance process. The bridge launch will require completing all the mandatory items on the checklist. Users will use the simple bridge at their own risk; this will be mentioned on the bridge\u2019s user interface.    Authorizing ESM on DssFlash to Remove Governance Permissions The Emergency Shutdown Module was authorized on the Flash Mint Module.  More Information  Based on this post from the Protocol Engineering Core Unit, this change was intended to patch a vulnerability discovered in the interaction between the Emergency Shutdown Module and the Flash Mint Module. Specifically, this change prevents a malicious governance action from re-activating the DssFlash module after the FlashKiller contract disables it.    Adding Support for New TUSD Implementation Support for the new TUSD implementation address was added.  More Information  Based on this post from the Protocol Engineering Core Unit, this addition was intended to resume collateral operations for TUSD-A, which were automatically halted after a February 24th change in which the TUSD team pointed to a new implementation address. For additional information, please consider reading this thread on the last time the TUSD contracts were modified.    Mitigate Post-Shutdown Flash Loan Vulnerability On March 9th, an executive proposal passed to mitigate the post-shutdown flash loan vulnerability in the Maker Protocol, as described by the Protocol Engineering Core Unit here.  More Information  Changes include:  Giving a new module flash-killer authorization over the Flash Mint Module so that anyone can permissionlessly use flash-killer to disable the Flash Mint Module in the event of an Emergency Shutdown. The vulnerability is not exploitable until three days (currently) after an Emergency Shutdown is triggered, meaning there is a 3-day window where any user can disable the Flash Mint Module using flash-killer before an exploit can take place.  The Protocol Engineering Core Unit considers this a temporary mitigation and recommends that the issue be solved more permanently in the future via the replacement of the Flash Mint Module. The source code for the flash-killer module can be found here. The flash-killer contract address is 0x07a4BaAEFA236A649880009B5a2B862097D9a1cD.    Add Rate Limiter to Flap Auctions As per two successful governance polls (1, 2), a new rate limiter was added to the flapper contract.  More Information  Changes include:   Modifying the Flapper-Contract by introducing a rate limit so the protocol can control the amount of simultaneously running flap-auctions. This is achieved by limiting the amount of Dai that can be simultaneously auctioned for MKR. Adding a parameter, lid, that sets the total amount of DAI allowed to be sent out to surplus (flap) auctions at once. Set the lid parameter to 150,000 DAI.  Please note that this executive proposal does not include a System Surplus Buffer; the Surplus Buffer will remain at the current value of 250 million Dai.    Immunefi Bug Bounty Payouts As part of the Immunefi Bug Bounty Program, a total reward amount of 2,750 DAI was transferred.  More Information    2,500 DAI was transferred to 0x3C32F2ca11D92a7093d1F237161C1fB692F6a8eA.  250 DAI was transferred to 0x2BC5fFc5De1a83a9e4cDDfA138bAEd516D70414b.  For further details, please see this forum thread.     Amend MIP64 to clarify critical web bounty amount (MIP4c3-SP1)  This governance poll passed, demonstrating support for amending MIP64 with MIP4c3-SP1 to clarify the critical web bounty amount.  More Information  The proposal author offered the following motivation for this amendment to MIP64c3: The reward for Critical website and application bug reports was not specified as intended. The reward was specified at 100,000 DAI \u201cif the impact leads to a direct loss in funds or a manipulation of the votes or the voting result, as well as the modification of its display leading to a misrepresentation of the result or vote.\u201d This part is clear. \u201cAll other impacts classified as Critical would be rewarded no more than USD 50,000.\u201d The words no more than suggest that inequality is intended. That is, bounty <= $50k instead of bounty = $50k. We omit the words \u201cno more than\u201d to obtain the intended reward mechanics.    Vault Management  Onboarding CRVV1ETHSTETH-A As per this successful governance poll, the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vault type was onboarded with the following parameters: Initial Collateral Parameters     Parameter Rate     Stability Fee 3.5%   Liquidation Ratio 155%   Maximum Debt Ceiling 3MM DAI   Target Available Debt 3MM DAI   Ceiling Increase Cooldown 8 Hours   Debt Floor 25.000 DAI     Liquidation Parameters     Parameter Rate     Auction Price Function Stairstep Exponential Decrease   Price Change Multiplier 0.99   Price Change Interval 90 Seconds   Auction Price Multiplier 1.30   Liquidation Penalty 13%     Limits     Parameter Rate     Local Liquidation Limit 3MM DAI   Maximum Auction Drawdown 0.4   Maximum Auction Duration 140 Minutes   Breaker Price Tolerance 0.5     Incentives     Parameter Rate     Proportional Kick Incentive 0.1%   Flat Kick Incentive 300 DAI       Maker Improvement Proposals Eleven ratification polls took place in March, all of which passed:  Ratification Polls      Ratification Poll Discussion     Declaration of Intent - Invest in Short-Term Bonds (MIP13c3-SP12) Discussion   Facilitators Offboarding (MDS-001) (MIP41c5-SP5) Discussion   GovAlpha Budget 2022-23 (MIP40c3-SP59) Discussion   Modify Core Unit Budget - Real-World Finance (RWF-001) (MIP40c3-SP61) Discussion   Modify GovAlpha Core Unit MKR Budget (MIP40c3-SP60) Discussion   Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Gelato Network (MIP63c4-SP3) Discussion   Onboard-Amend Keeper Network - Keep3r Network (MIP63c4-SP2) Discussion   Rapid Payment for Small Bug Bounties (MIP64, MIP40c3-SP42 Amendment) (MIP4c2-SP17) Discussion   Recognized Delegate Compensation (MIP61) Discussion   MIP62 Amendments (MIP4c3-SP2) Discussion   ETHAmsterdam Event (MIP55c3-SP3) Discussion       Parameter Management View a detailed breakdown of last month\u2019s parameter changes proposal published by the MOMC.  1248\u00d7440 141 KB   Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) Management      Vault Type Parameter Change Previous New     WSTETH-A Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) +100MM DAI 200M DAI 300MM DAI   DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Maximum Debt Ceiling (line) +80MM DAI 220MM DAI 300MM DAI      Target Available Debt (gap) Management      Vault Type Parameter Change Previous New     WSTETH-A Target Available Debt (gap) +10MM DAI 20MM DAI 20MM DAI   DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Target Available Debt (gap) +15MM DAI 50MM DAI 60MM DAI      Target Borrow Rate (bar) Management      Vault Type Parameter Change Previous New     DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI Target Borrow Rate (bar) -0.65% 3.50% 2.85%       Core Unit Budget Management  Core Unit Budget Transfers  As per multiple successful budget proposals, a total of 397,184 Dai was transferred to multiple Core Units:     Core Unit Transfer Amount Proposal     Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit 259,184 DAI Proposal   Immunefi Security Core Unit 138,000 DAI Proposal     Core Unit Budget Streams As per multiple successful budget proposals, a total of 397,184 Dai was streamed to multiple Core Units:     Core Unit Stream Amount Proposal     Collateral Engineering Services Core Unit 2,780,562 DAI Proposal   Risk Core Unit 2,760,000 DAI Proposal   Immunefi Security Core Unit 207,000 DAI Proposal       Delegate Compensation Recognized Delegate Compensation Payments: February 2022 As per two successful governance polls (1, 2) and the ongoing trial of delegate compensation, a total of 57,665 DAI was distributed to eight Recognized Delegates:     DAI Transferred Delegate     12,000 DAI FlipFlopFlap Delegate LLC   12,000 DAI schuppi   12,000 DAI Feedblack Loops LLC   8,512 DAI MakerMan   6,494 DAI ACREinvest   5,072 DAI monetsupply   927 DAI JustinCase   660 DAI GFX Labs     Details on the breakdown of delegate compensation for February can be found on the MakerDAO forum here.    Community Greenlight Polls Greenlight Polls allow MKR token holders to signal their preferences for collateral types proposed through Collateral Onboarding Applications. Community Greenlight polls occur at fixed times each governance cycle, starting on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month, and run for two full weeks. March did not have any Community Greenlight Polls. Check the progress of all proposed collateral types in the Collateral Status Index.  What\u2019s Ahead? Links to both the Votes and Public Calls calendars can be found below under Resources.  3047\u00d71725 303 KB  Here are some things to expect and look forward to in March.  Votes and Polls There is currently one active signal request, ending April 5th, to onboard PAXG as collateral for multi-collateral Dai. The Signal Request is successfully passing at the time of writing and can be expected to go on-chain later this month.  Pre-MIP Discussions Take a look at the current pre-MIP discussions taking place on the forum:  Anti-inflationary Proposal Auction-backed DAI IAM for Surplus Buffer Proposal Ideas on the Forum [Pre-MIP] Using Gyroscope to cut through Dai\u2019s Gordian knot: its USDC dependency An RWA style solution to replace the PSM   Delegation and Compensation The Recognized Delegate compensation for March has just been released. Delegate Round-up for March should be released by GovAlpha very soon; keep an eye out for that report as well as their accompanying on-chain polls to fund qualified delegates.  Tokenomics Discussion on Maker tokenomics continues into April. stkMKR, overall tokenomics revisions, and potentially new proposals are expected to see further discussion over several months. Keep an eye out for upcoming forum posts and public calls around this topic.  Core Unit Activity The first quarter of 2022 has now ended, so some Core Units may be working on submitting their quarterly reviews and updates. These updates will be available on the forum and in the Monthly Core Unit Updates Report in a few weeks.  Forum Management GovAlpha just introduced the Forum Explorer as an initiative to help improve user experience by making it easier to browse forum content through accessible filter mechanisms and configurable queries. In addition, GovAlpha introduces impact estimation tags on the forum for active governance items such as MIPs and Signal Requests. The objective is to provide delegates, Core Unit members, and the wider Maker community with an idea of how important new governance items are and how much of their limited time they may want to spend investigating them.  Resources Maker Operational Manual The GovAlpha Core Unit announces the launch of the Maker Operational Manual and invites all members and Core Units to reach out if they wish to provide any help or documentation.

Governance Summary The month of February contained only two executive polls regarding a majority of Core Units, delegates, and members attending ETHDenver. There were no executive polls on February 11 or 18. Non-executive polls ran as usual. Core Units gave a brief review of their experiences at ETHDenver during the February 24th Governance and Risk Call. Dai Total Supply surpassed 10 billion! There was an NFT meme competition\u2014congratulations to the winner, who received a one-of-a-kind makerburn NFT commemorating this event. As of March 1st, Dai Total Supply has dropped to 9.6 billion. In response to Flappy Friday, the community expressed support for introducing Rate Limiting into the Flapper. Its on-chain poll passed. The proposed parameters have been announced and passed their on-chain poll. There have been many announcements regarding delegation; we now have two new recognized delegates who announced their platforms: Doo Delegate and Flipside Crypto. They presented their delegate platforms on Wednesday, March 2nd; their presentations are available here. We closed out February with nine recognized and fourteen shadow delegates with ~98,000 MKR delegated. The delegate compensation trial has been extended by a maximum of an additional six months, and February\u2019s delegate compensation has been announced. MakerMan\u2019s retroactive compensation for November 2021 was supported by the community and passed its on-chain poll. In addition, GovAlpha published a thread containing all resources related to delegation. February contained eight ratification polls on the MIP side of things, which have all passed except one. The Emergency Shutdown Module threshold vote successfully passed, and the threshold was increased to 100,000 MKR. Finally, February contained three community greenlight polls. All three did not pass. Check out Key Outcomes below for more information. Check out \u2018What\u2019s Ahead?\u2019 below for insight on what to expect in March!

Several signal requests on the forum are still open for community vote. Implement Governance Mining Trial recently closed and did not pass; we may see a revised signal request in the future. Here are other signal requests to keep an eye on:  Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot Bring back the burn part II Allocate 20M to protocol owned Uniswap V2 MKR/DAI LP  Take a look at the pre-MIP discussions currently on the forum:  Auction-backed DAI IAM for Surplus Buffer Proposal Ideas on the Forum [Pre-MIP] Using Gyroscope to cut through Dai\u2019s Gordian knot: its USDC dependency An RWA style solution to replace the PSM  A new MOMC parameter change proposal for March has passed, making changes to both WSTETH-A and DIRECT-AAVEV2-DAI. Parameters for the Rate Limiter have been announced and passed their on-chain poll, which added the parameter lid to set the total value of DAI allowed to be sent out to surplus (flap) auctions at once. Out of respect and a desire to help promote the global community toward a prosperous and more fair future, the MakerDAO community has pushed a signal request and discussion to aid Ukraine by lending Dai through a Vault, Loan, or War Bond. Details on the method of issuing Dai are currently under discussion; keep an eye out for follow-up threads and/or an on-chain poll.

Show some love to our Medium account    Governance Summary  Votes and Polls April contained five executive votes; one emergency executive went on-chain on April 13. The month also contained a total of thirteen ratification polls detailed below. Eleven of them passed except for Ratification Poll for Modify Core Unit Budget, COM-001 and Ratification Poll for Pairwyse Licensure.  Check out Key Outcomes below for additional details on Polls and Votes.   Financials and Budgets Five Core Units had a successful transfer and/or stream of Dai; 1,057,918 Dai was transferred to PE, Events, GovComms, and SH Core Units. Additionally, 9,758,130 Dai was streamed to PE, Data, Events, and GovComms Core Units. One ratification poll to modify GovComm\u2019s Core Unit Budget by onboarding a PR member did not pass.  Delegation and Compensation 77,183 Dai was distributed to nine Recognized Delegates for April, as detailed below. Three of the nine delegates received the maximum amount of 12,000 Dai. For additional information, check out April\u2019s Recognized Delegate Compensation Breakdown.  ETHAmsterdam Event SPF Recently, MakerDAO hosted an event at the ETHDenver conference called DAIvinity. Due to its overwhelming success and response from the Maker Community, it was decided to host another event during ETHAmsterdam. In parallel to this SPF, a Core Unit proposal has been put forth on the forum for feedback (see MIP39c2-SP32). EVENTS-001 has been proposed based on discussion with the Maker community to provide a permanent budget and ongoing hosting of MakerDAO events. Due to the time constraint imposed by MakerDAO\u2019s governance cycle to get the funding in time before ETHAmsterdam happened, this SPF was created to partially fund the event. The remainder of the funds came from participating Core Units.  Oracles  Whitelist Oasis.app on Multiple Oracles Oasis.app, a third-party application for accessing the Maker Protocol and wider DeFi ecosystem, is planning to launch new automation features to allow for better management and protection of Maker Vaults going forward. A MIP10c9-SP30 proposal was submitted at the beginning of April to whitelist ETHUSD, WSTETHUSD, BTCUSD, YFIUSD, UNIUSD, LINKUSD, and MANAUSD on Oasis.app. In accordance with the Responsible Oracle Migration Proposal, fees were waived for the first year.  Replacing the Curve stETH/ETH Oracle The CRVV1ETHSTETH-A oracle was frozen in the April 13th emergency executive at 22:25 UTC to mitigate a potential vulnerability successfully. During the previous week, existing vaults of the CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vault-type could not withdraw collateral unless they paid off their full debt; users were not at risk of liquidation during this time. This proposal was communicated and recommended for voting to delegates to prevent any adverse impact on MakerDAO. Additional information is available here. A post-mortem will soon be available.  Community Greenlight Polls April contained two Greenlight Polls, which both passed:  sETH2 (Stakewise Staked ETH) StakeWise, a derivative token that is 100% collateralized, is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry. ETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenized into sETH2, representing users\u2019 interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2. As a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH, utilizing the protocol\u2019s deep liquidity pools. sETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenized staking deposit into StakeWise\u2019s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1:1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts like an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH, providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2. Expected use case(s) of Dai generated by this Vault includes:  Trading, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH. Leverage ETH staking yields (deposit sETH2 collateral, borrow Dai, buy ETH and stake, for example).    HVBANK (Huntingdon Valley Bank Loan Syndication Collateral) Huntingdon Valley Bank is a State Chartered American commercial bank owned by the publicly-held holding company HV Bancorp. Inc. (NASDAQ Listed: HVBC).  1767\u00d71575 552 KB   Governance Issues, Discussions, and Calls Given the current market pressure and sentiment, the Maker community has been fighting to shine a light on longer-term visions toward growth, governance, and profitability. Below are the most popular discussions going on right now:  GovComms Core Unit held a public Issue Discussion Call featuring Robert, Core Unit facilitator of Collateral Engineering Services, illuminating on the new proposed Collateral Onboarding process and how it will improve transparency. Optimism recently introduced the Optimism Collective, a new type of community designed to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Eth. Matt_NZ suggests we study Optimism\u2019s new governance model to build a more democratic system and offer ideas for incentivizing positive contributions to the community. SebVentures signal request supports the Aggressive Growth Strategy by proposing to allocate some of the balance sheets of MakerDAO to ETH and/or ETH derivatives. April did not escape the discussion on burning MKR. Andrew Burban signals to begin immediately burning MKR at a reduced rate until we develop something better. However, ultraschuppi has also submitted a signal request to set the lid to 30,000 Dai, which will limit the maximum of MKR burnt a day from 7.2MM Dai to 1.44MM Dai.   Hey! We need your opinion! SES and Julian are researching challenges and opportunities for Maker regarding environmental, social, and governance (ESG). They are currently asking the community\u2019s opinion to help identify topics with potential business relevance. Check out the survey here. Check out their summary on April 28th\u2019s Governance & Risk Call.  Check out \u2018What\u2019s Ahead?\u2019 below for insights on what to expect in April!  Key Outcomes All votes mentioned are assumed to have successfully passed unless otherwise noted.  ETHAmsterdam Event Special Purpose Fund DAI Distribution As per this successful Special Purpose Fund (SPF) application, 50,000 DAI was transferred to the ETHAmsterdam SPF Event multi-sig wallet at the address 0xF34ac684BA2734039772f0C0d77bc2545e819212. Further information about this wallet set-up can be found in this forum post.  Copy Stub For Out-Of-Schedule Executive  An oracle was frozen in an emergency executive to mitigate a potential vulnerability. View this post for additional information.  Fund Ambassadors Program Pilot As per this successful governance poll, 25,000 DAI was transferred to the Ambassadors Program multi-sig wallet. For further information, please see the signal request thread here.  Replace Gelato Keeper Top-Up Contract DAI Stream As per this forum post, the Protocol Engineering Core Unit have included a replacement for the Gelato Keeper stream in this executive proposal to resolve a bug related to token approvals.  The existing stream was revoked, and previously streamed funds are used to fund keeper actions as planned.  1,000 DAI per day is being streamed to the new contract for 6 months.   Oasis.app Whitelists As per the outcome of this governance poll, Oasis.app was whitelisted on the following OSM Oracles:     Oracle     ETH/USD   WSTETH/USD   WBTC/USD   RENBTC/USD   YFI/USD   UNI/USD   LINK/USD   MANA/USD     Replacing the Curve stETH/ETH Oracle Due to technical issues referenced here, the Curve stETH/ETH oracle was replaced and reactivated. This action involved removing permissions on the previous oracle implementation, adding permissions on the new oracle implementation, and replicating the whitelist for this oracle on the new implementation. This restored full functionality to the Curve stETH/ETH oracle and CRVV1ETHSTETH-A vaults.  Collateral Management  TUSD Collateral Offloading As per this successful governance poll, TUSD collateral in the Maker Protocol was liquidated under the following parameters. The communication and lead-time requirements for offboarding collateral defined in MIP62 have been met. TUSD Parameters under Liquidation:     Parameter Amount     Liquidations Enabled   Auction Price Function Linear Decrease (tau: 250 days (estimated 10bps drop per 6 hours = 250 days till 0))   Liquidation Penalty 0%   Liquidation Ratio 150%   Auction Price Multiplier 1.00   Local Liquidation Limit 5MM DAI   Max Auction Duration 5 days (implies minimum price of 0.98)   Proportional Kick Incentive 0 DAI   Flat Kick Incentive 0 DAI*     *The Protocol Engineering Core Unit has reduced the Flat Kick Incentive to zero as detailed here. For further information, please see the proposal forum thread here.

The DssVest DAI contract was updated to prevent vat.suck calls from being possible in the event of an emergency shutdown. This included checking to ensure that vat.suck only works when the system is live for all new vest contracts. For existing contracts, the ESM was relied on to allow keepers to remove pause proxy permissions if governance becomes malicious after shutdown. Note that this is relevant only after a shutdown occurs. All vest functionality remains the same as per the original contract. All existing streams remain the same, but new streams are from a new contract.   Delegate Compensation Recognized Delegate Compensation Payments: April 2022 A total of 77,183 DAI was distributed to nine Recognized Delegates:     DAI Transferred Delegate     12,000 DAI FlipFlopFlap Delegate LLC   12,000 DAI schuppi   12,000 DAI Feedblack Loops LLC   10,761 DAI MakerMan   9,295 DAI ACREinvest   7,598 DAI monetsupply   6,640 DAI JustinCase   6,606 DAI GFX Labs   283 DAI Doo     Details on the breakdown of delegate compensation for April can be found on the MakerDAO forum here.

Fund Retrieval Exclusion MKR voters recently passed this proposal for the dissolution of the Content Production Multi-Sig (you can view the thread here. One of the items within the proposal was the retrieval of nearly 3,800 Dai which the multisig can still claim from the Surplus Buffer. However, retrieving the Dai will not be included in an executive spell due to the technical and ETH cost of doing so.
