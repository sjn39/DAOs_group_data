Join us 2022-03-16T15:00:00Z as we host Notional Finance\u2019s Co-Founder, Teddy Woodward @twoodward, to introduce the project to the community.  Agenda    Intro by @juan & @retro  Presentation by Notional Finance\u2019s Teddy Woodward @twoodward. Community Q&A.   [Signal Request] Onboard D3M For Notional Finance   GFX Labs is signaling to onboard a D3M for Notional Finance\u2019s 3-month-maturity DAI lending pool 2, with an initial debt ceiling of 10 million DAI (unless recommended otherwise by Risk Core Unit). \u2026 Notional Finance operates a fixed-rate, overcollateralized lending platform. It currently operates with four assets: ETH, WBTC, USDC, and DAI. Currently supported maturities for DAI are at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (this signal is seeking to onboard the 3-month maturity). As of writing, the yield curve for DAI is an inverted humped curve, meaning the rates are lowest in the middle. This is a sign of short-term demand outstripping short-term supply. At its core, Notional\u2019s model is the familiar overcollateralized lending model. Users lock collateral, which can also be lent for interest, which then secures the loan the borrower takes out. The main difference between a user locking ETH in a Maker vault to borrow DAI and that same user locking ETH in a Notional pool to borrow DAI is that Notional\u2019s platform has a fixed term, at which payment is due, and governance cannot alter the fees that accrue to the borrower. Functionally, Notional is a marketplace for zero-coupon bonds, whose discount to face value provides the rate of interest.

Welcome to another Collateral Onboarding Call. This is episode #39.   We are exploring another type of collateral to mint Dai. In this case, it is part of the D3M, which was initially launched with Aave. For those that have any questions about that, you can check the forum at forum.makerdao.com.   My name is Juan. I am the facilitator for the Core Unit Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling. Today we are with Teddy Woodward from Notional Finance and we also have PaperImperium which is one of the recognized delegates representing GFX Labs.   Discussions about collateral happen in the Forum.    Notional Finance (D3M)  Teddy Woodward  Presentation 01:02 Signal Request: Onboard Notional Finance - Forum Thread  Lend Crypto at Fixed Rates1920\u00d71095 194 KB   Fixed APY1920\u00d71072 166 KB   Fixed APY1919\u00d71097 180 KB   Questions 10:30 - Juan: The people that are borrowing the Dai are borrowing at a fixed rate, and the premise is that they will have to return it. Is there some rolling at the maturity, or how does that work? Is it also over collateralized? 11:59 - Frank Cruz: For someone who deposits Dai into Notional, what is the risk, what is their upside, and downside? 14:19 - Frank Cruz: If there was a crisis where the Yearn Vaults had to be liquidated, are they in Yearn or living in Notional? 15:43 - Juan: Maybe you can address the concerns, mainly around scalability and a little bit less on prioritization. 18:14 - Kianga Daverington: Could you share your regulatory risk assessment for your firm and if you have had any inquiries from authorities regarding the products? 19:57 - Kianga Daverington: Have you been advised by council? Do you view the current assessment of your firm and product in terms of the regulatory landscape and licenses that you may or may not be required? 22:29 - Tim: Why D3M and why not the Term Lending Module? 25:07 - Nadia: If we integrate D3M in Compound, will it be almost the same as if we integrated with you? What will be the difference? 27:46 - Juan: Where can people reach out if they have any questions or any more comments or next steps call to action?  Closing Comment  Juan  Outro 28:14  For everyone watching this later, the signal request might still be on. Thanks for joining.   Credits  Kunfu-po produced this summary. Gala produced this summary.
