The purpose of this ring is to combine forces to further research in this area and to broaden the aspects of research in this field. This means that members may collaborate, share ideas, and help each other out in research. I would encourage all members to share their work for the greater good. Some suggested research topics that the ring may discuss and research include:  Approaches to decentralization Different states of decentralization Different types of decentralization The structure and design of decentralized systems Generalize decentralized systems, not only blockchain  The aim of this ring would be to:  Combine and share knowledge in the field with other members Conduct and collaborate on research, including writing articles, etc. Educate about decentralization and push the movement forwards Create some kind of standard for decentralization (without limiting innovation)  I\u2019ve created a working draft here: https://hackmd.io/s/ry9o67Z5Q for anyone interested. If there is community consensus about creating such a group, I will go ahead and add this to github. Any thoughts? ",

I\u2019m part of a decentralization focused community commons in Vancouver BC, and we really think that this concept is the thread which runs through not just blockchain, but every technology and practice that could potentially transform societal power structures. If @boris and other OG magicians think there\u2019s room for it, I would happily focus in on this Ring alongside you. An emphasis on decentralization helps us separate out the wheat from the chaff as far as \u201cdoes (x) need to be on a blockchain?\u201d which is a crucial navigation with Ethereum so overloaded in these early days.

The goal is to help the entire community better access education resources as a whole. If it is necessary to create new resources, we will come up with ideas where and how these can be built. However, if there are already great resources available, we would love to highlight content that is already available and help direct more people to these resources. I can envision creating a repository that helps navigate traffic e.g. if you are looking for insights and best practices for creating user wallets, we help navigate the community to educational documents for existing wallet projects that have resources available. I think the intersections can be really powerful but they also need a better way of organizing and directing the community to what is available. ",

As a recap, here are the three main issues that were captured in the ring formation statement:  There currently isn\u2019t a good knowledge repository that provides a holistic perspective on Ethereum development (EF website is OK, but few people use this a resource to understand what Ethereum is and how to actually develop on it). How can we help define what is needed for this repository and build it? How do we make onboarding into the Ethereum community fun & friendly? How do we best manage these knowledge repositories moving forward \u2013 how to fund those initiatives and make them open to contributing?  Based on the discussion from the Council of Berlin, I think #1 and #2 will be great topics to delve deeper into for Council of Prague. What other questions or ideas would you like to tackle under the umbrella of Education? This is a very free form call out but really just want some raw ideas to start with that we can then add on to.

For those who create audiovisual content we can teach them how to use Golem, which will reduce their work time editing videos. To the developers we teach Gitcoin\u2026 There are many interesting projects. I think that if we focus on teaching how it works by giving it tools that are working we can keep those who enter speculation away and focus on technology and how it can solve problems or help them in their work.

                    "content": "Hey all, we are announcing the Ethereum Provider Ring (Short: Provider Ring). During Devcon @marcgarreau got some people around the topic of Ethereum providers together. We kicked off a ring formation, and planned to establish more regular communication about fun stuff like EIP1102 + EIP1193. We agreed that we will benefit from more structured conversations. Therefore this new Provider Ring. Teams involved so far:  Mist Browser: @marcgarreau, Ryan  Metamask: @bitpshr, Bobby  Status: @jeluard, @rachelhamlin, @andrey  imToken: @p0s , @kaichen  web3.js: Samuel  ethers.js: Richard   Who else is in? Topics (potential forum threads) so far:  coordinate a tentative EIP 1193 release date; potential rescheduling EIP1102 + 1193 rollout discuss nonstandard convenience methods (e.g. isLocked) how to switch active account? (e.g. force + additional params) introducing specific new RPC methods (e.g. eth_changeNetwork ) generic path for introducing new RPC methods (e.g. one EIP per method; first EIP establishes a template) \u2026 and communication: establishing regular communication (hangouts, discord), inviting remaining providers.  Next steps: I will follow the how to and everybody is welcome to chime in and give feedback! Who else is in? ",

Either we have wallets that only really allow you do manage your assets (maybe some have some deep linking support, e.g. Trust) or we have a browser with an integrated wallet (imToken, Status, Opera, MetaMask) It would be nice if there was something that works better with native apps, e.g a service on Android.
