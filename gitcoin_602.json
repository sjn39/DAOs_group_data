Food and non fungible token The idea is straight forward, every farmers could own  digital asset as NFT of their food production and any processors, restaurant or retailers that use this product can own a parent NFT that will refer to the NFT unique ID. Please let us know if you feel connected as well to this idea, Have a good day! Love and Peace to the community ",
