                    "content": "Perhaps I am just venting, but it strikes me as odd that MakerDAO would be excluded from any conversation about DAOs. Case in point, I recently came across a \u201cDAO Summit\u201d scheduled for next week at Stanford. There, you have representatives from Compound, Uniswap and Bankless informing the world about DAOs. From what I know from interacting with these other communities, they lack (i) independent workforces, (ii) native means to compensate DAO contributors from protocol operations (i.e., not just paying people in their governance token through grants), and (iii) a demonstrated history of self-governance, among other things, and as a result, are not as well-placed as MakerDAO to perform this educational role. I\u2019m unsure what CU would be the best to engage in a symposium like this, but if we can have DAO members who participate in these talks, it would behoove us to do so. Engaging with university clubs like Stanford and Harvard is a way to augment institutional knowledge and garner more credence as a \u201clegitimate\u201d player before prying regulatory eyes (IMO).  (I threw up in my non-Ivy League mouth writing this but it\u2019s the truth in the US, for better or worse). Anyhow, the point of this rant is figuring out which CU would participate in a symposium like this. Gov-Alpha? SES? Marcomms (presuming it is onboarded)? Or forum rando (looking at myself in the mirror and furiously trying to contact Paper or Replenish2030)? ",

Sorry for being late to the party! @Tosh9.0 perhaps these insights might be helpful to relieve your rant   At the DAO Summit, MakerDAO was mentioned by multiple third party sources in almost every single segment - Robert Leshner gave a shoutout in his fireside chat, PlaceholderVC even said \u201cCore Unit\u201d. Sometimes referrals build better influence than self-promotion   Even if MakerDAO isn\u2019t in the panel circuit or Twittersphere, MakerDAO is definitely recognized as a \u201cmature\u201d DAO. Several teams have reached out to me about transforming into a more decentralized structure for their DAO and admiration has been consistent. Teams are super curious about how MakerDAO did it at such a large scale. If someone from the DAO wants to expand on their insights about MakerDAO, I\u2019m happy to connect teams them. I agree MakerDAO should be spending just a tad bit on being part of the greater DAO discussions, but I think it\u2019s difficult to ask the Facilitators to do talks on top of the work they already have. (I turned down speaking engagements during my time because I felt time was better spent working on things than speaking about it). The only reason I talk more now is because I have time to reflect and I think there was a lot of really great nuggets in the process + we\u2019re just now seeing more of the outcomes rather than theorizing\u2026and that\u2019s the real difference between Maker and a lot of the newer DAOs. That being said, I do think it\u2019s important to maintain some visibility - no one will see the great work that gets done here! I agree with everyone\u2019s comments that I think MakerDAO is not often invited because it\u2019s so decentralized and doing its own thing that no one really knows who to reach out to, not because there\u2019s intentional exclusion. That being said, I\u2019ve also pointed people to core unit facilitators.  Disclaimer for the panel: Connor (the organizer) had connected with me regarding the research cooperative and I mentioned I was leaving Maker so I connected them to the Faciltators.      juan:  We\u2019re in touch with this group, and one of the requirements is to make a donation for research and whitepapers. While SES more or less agree with the value projected to be produced, we are rallying to increase the budget for our Grants Program.   And yes, I\u2019ve left both the Foundation and MakerDAO, miss all the brains here! ",
