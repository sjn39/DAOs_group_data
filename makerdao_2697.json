This proposal adds FTX (ETH/USD) and Uniswap (ETH/USDC) as price sources for the ETH/USD Oracle and removes Bitfinex (ETH/USDT).

Similarly, FTX has experienced remarkable growth and now boasts a significant Ethereum volume against USD. Meanwhile there is continued uncertainty over Tether\u2019s backing.  What is better about the new Data Model? This proposal would remove any dependency on USDT from the ETH/USD Data Model. It also adds Uniswap as a source which as an AMM is very expensive for an attacker to manipulate.
