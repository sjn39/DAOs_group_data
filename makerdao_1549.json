I know that many will not agree to do that (or at least it can no longer be done, but only copying Maker and Dai contracts and then deploying them with that update) with the decentralized product that is Dai, but a world without any kind of order or rules seems catastrophic and chaotic, on the one hand, the U. E. treasury is right, but on the other hand, that kind of control can lend itself to other kinds of injustices, so after having introduced that kind of regulatory control over circulating Dai to the Maker protocol and governance, the situation can become more complicated as one would have to be very careful not to block black Dai in innocent wallets that passed quickly between protocols. Think carefully if this is good and applicable for Maker.     Good and applicable for Maker Not good and not applicable for Maker     0 voters     ",

I honestly dont think that Dai will be allowed to call itself stablecoin and wont be approved by the us government. I dont think makerdao can be compliant even if they tried without completly destroying Dai and making it useless. If we start censoring and backing with US government bonds. Dai is basically like USDC plus the self mint option with crypto, doubt that will be ok with the government. But then Dai has no choice other than to comply. ",
