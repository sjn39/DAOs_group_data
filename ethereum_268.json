It will merge yours immediately if certain criteria are met:   - The PR edits only existing draft PRs.  - The build passes.  - Your GitHub username or email address is listed in the 'author' header of all affected PRs, inside <triangular brackets>.  - If matching on email address, the email address is the one publicly listed on your GitHub profile.       A standardized way to deposit, withdraw and retrieve creator fee (\u201croyalty\u201d) information associated with a human readable name - this standard enables universal support for royalty payments across social networks, NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants, its generic design can be implemented on any EVM compatible blockchain and its specific implementation is intended to associate royalties with a hashtag (#) name, however, it is highly versatile and can be used to attribute royalties for any Ethereum address, for example, an NFT.  Implementation Addresses We have implemented this proposed standard on the following blockchains.     # Contract Name Blockchain Address     1 HashtagNFTCollectiveTreasury Ethereum 0xe4E9ae2D65008d171A07C12F20D5a5d62Fb31776     Moonbeam 0xA50e98f9cb301c04B9BB34d1BD95c2Dc8F3e8Ff3     Moonriver 0xA50e98f9cb301c04B9BB34d1BD95c2Dc8F3e8Ff3     Celo 0x72824902d75F9832002c7907DF61a60A4AB801C9     Unique 0xA50e98f9cb301c04B9BB34d1BD95c2Dc8F3e8Ff3     Quartz 0xA50e98f9cb301c04B9BB34d1BD95c2Dc8F3e8Ff3   2 HashtagNFTCollectiveResolver Ethereum 0xA50e98f9cb301c04B9BB34d1BD95c2Dc8F3e8Ff3     Moonbeam 0x9a6Cba29cc0cA4f18990F32De15aae08819F4cD0     Moonriver 0x9a6Cba29cc0cA4f18990F32De15aae08819F4cD0     Celo 0xdEc0F21665065e0c67b8eD107b1767c95cC4A763     Unique 0x9a6Cba29cc0cA4f18990F32De15aae08819F4cD0     Quartz 0x9a6Cba29cc0cA4f18990F32De15aae08819F4cD0    Further implementation details may be found in the Livetree repository here.
