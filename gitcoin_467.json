                    "content": " Gitcoin Grants Round 10 Virtual Hackathon   June 16th - July 7th, 2021  Join us in the  Gitcoin Discord  to discuss all things grants, hacks, and more!    Discussions at #hacker-talk   Networking at #find-teammates   Assistance at #events-support   Party at #gr10-hackathon  It\u2019s time for another celebration of Ethereum and Web3  Grants Round 10 begins June 16th with the biggest matching pool yet, ready to be distributed to our community for funding public goods! Grants CLR rounds are an experiment in mechanism design, community governance, quadratic funding, and decentralized identity. We want to applaud the Ethereum community, the success of our current and past grantees, and the donors contributing to the future of the Web3 ecosystem. During each quarterly round, our community rewards the hard work and contributions others have already made, while also funding the projects we believe will make the largest impact in the future. During Rounds 8 and 9 we began running \u201cStacked Events\u201d by pairing a hackathon with the grants round, encouraging the community to support a decentralized future by either building or donating to projects (or both!)  Why register for the GR10 Hackathon?   The GR9 hackathon was our biggest ever, with 2250 participants, 17 sponsors, and over $350,000 worth of bounties up for grabs - and we want to go even bigger this time around! Gitcoin will be running a series of webinars, workshops, and community discussions for the grants round and hackathon together with industry leaders, grantees, and hackathon sponsors, matching pool funders, and more. Whether you\u2019re joining to learn new technologies, meet others in our community, chill and/or shill - there will be something for you! Developers are encouraged and provided guidance to convert their hackathon project(s) into grants for future rounds.  We\u2019d like to invite you to join us to build the future of Web3, learn from online workshops, open new grants, and if you can, help fund great projects that are contributing to the public goods ecosystem.  Workshop Schedule  All workshops and community sessions will be hosted on the Hackathon Airmeet - Link and schedule to come soon! Add the Gitcoin Community Calendar to your personal Google calendar to see when new events are happening!  What is Gitcoin Grants anyway?  If you\u2019re a new or returning hacker, but haven\u2019t ventured out to the Grants side of the Gitcoin platform, you\u2019re in for a treat! Gitcoin Grants is an experiment where people can fund their open source projects for public benefit with QF (Quadratic Funding) matching contributions from Gitcoin\u2019s Matching Fund, sponsored by donors in the Web3 ecosystem. By using QF, even a $1 donation to a project you support can earn them a match of 10-100x that amount. Grants Round 8 saw $555,000 in contributions and $500,000 in matched funds distributed across 566 projects . Grants Round 9 saw $1,380,000 in contributions and $500,000 in matched funds distributed across 812 projects . (Bonus - check out Vitalik\u2019s retro) If you\u2019d like to learn more, open your own grant, or donate, visit the grants about page and wiki to learn more!  HOW DOES THE HACKATHON WORK?
