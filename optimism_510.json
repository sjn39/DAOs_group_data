(Builders Grants, Growth Experiment Grants): Builders Grants Project description (please explain how your project works): We are building tools that enable NFT communities on Optimism acquire ENS sub-domains at zero cost. This is accomplished via utilizing an ENS feature called wildcard resolution. Our suite of tools allows anyone with an ENS name to link it to a collection and provide the NFT holders with free subdomains that are immediately compatible with popular wallets e.g Metamask & Trust wallet. Developers will also be able to utilize our open-source tools to build collection-specific ENS integrations. ENSIP 10 - ENSIP-10: Wildcard Resolution - ENS Documentation Website: https://wildcards.wtf Twitter: https://twitter.com/wildcardswtf Discord/Discourse/Community: Other relevant links (including any demos): Additional team member info (please link): Steve G (project lead) - https://twitter.com/stevegachauhellenstans.eth (dev) - https://twitter.com/hellenstans NB: We will be launching bounties to incentivize web3 & ENS contributors/devs that build on top of our tools. Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to: @ensredirect - https://twitter.com/ensredirectECC Name Service on Optimism - https://opensea.io/collection/ecc-name-service@mintbot - https://twitter.com/mintbot_io@ensregistry - https://twitter.com/ensregistryOur team also just received a grant by ApeCoin DAO via Meebits DAO to create ENS wildcard domains for Meebits NFT holders - Prop House Relevant usage metrics (TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. Optimism metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.): ECC Name service which uses our Optimism resolver has been used by over 3,641 users who have created over 18,000 names on Optimism - ECC Domains (ECC) Token Tracker | Optimism Competitors, peers, or similar projects (please link): Punk Domains - https://punk.domainsESF tools - https://esf.tools/ Is/will this project be open sourced?: Yes Optimism native?: Yes Date of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 4/13/2023 What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?: NFT projects & communities on Optimism have expressed a desire to use ENS names and subdomains to identify and connect with their users and holders. However, the cost of setting a distinct record on the ENS Registry for each subdomain can be prohibitively expensive for communities with large user bases. This creates unnecessary friction for NFT holders, who often stand to benefit greatly from the usability improvements offered by ENS names. How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?: ENS Wildcard subdomains offer a solution to this problem by allowing every NFT holder in a specified collection (e.g OptiChads) to receive an ENS name at no cost & without registration. The process for the ENS domain holder is simple: just link their domain name to the NFT collection they want to support. From there, digit subdomains (such as 69.optichads.eth) will automatically point to and resolve to the current owner of the NFT in the chosen collection (for example, Chad #69) Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?: The possibility of acquiring free ENS domains will drive users to explore Optimism and Optimism NFTs.Communities on Optimism will be able to unite under a single namespace with built-in utility, helping to create a more cohesive and connected ecosystem. Has your project previously applied for an OP grant?: No Number of OP tokens requested: 45,000 OP Did the project apply for or receive OP tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?: No If OP tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?: N/A How much will your project match in co-incentives? (not required but recommended, when applicable): N/A How will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.): Since builder grants tokens will be locked for 1 year, we will use funding from our team treasury as follows: 50% - Developer and infrastructure costs to build (and maintain) a general purpose frontend, Optimism wildcard resolver contract & an Optimism gateway server.30% - Integration bounties for other community devs to build collection-specific tools. (funded by the team) 10% - Integrations with existing web3 and NFT tools. 10% - Bug bounty program for our smart contracts (funded by the team) Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals: Funds will be allocated over a period of 1 yr. Please clearly define the milestones you expect to achieve in order to receive milestone based installments. Please consider how each milestone relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Progress towards each milestone must be trackable: Project Goals:  To increase the number of ENS domains linked to NFT collections on Optimism. Unite communities under a single namespace with built-in utility, helping to create a more cohesive and connected ecosystem for NFT communities. Make it practically free for Optimism community members to obtain an ENS domain, reducing the barriers to entry for those who want to use ENS.
