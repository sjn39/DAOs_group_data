                    "content": "Hello all, MakerDAO recently activated liquidations on stablecoin vaults, specifically USDC-A, USDP-A, GUSD-A, which successfully cleared all positions below the liquidation ratio. There are still few over collateralized vault positions remaining, totaling to 3.682M dai debt across all vault types, majority of debt is within the USDC-A vault type. These vault types serve little purpose to the protocol since PSM was established, therefore we are proposing to offboard them as the liquidity will likely end up increasing the reserves. The positions do carry some theoretical value for their owners, due to the possibility of dai trading below par, at which they could be profitability unwinded by their respective owners. Some of them are abandoned, and liquidation is the only way for removing them from the system. It is likely that the corresponding collateral will be liquidated into PSM, which will increase current reserves; at current time there is sufficient unutilized DC in all of respective PSMs to facilitate liquidity of dai required in the process. The remaining vault positions can be seen here. Currently there are 73 open vaults, ranging up to 1125% CR.  USDC-A; 3.344M dai debt, 69 vaults remaining USDP-A; 101.81 dai debt, 1 vault remaining GUSD-A; 338K dai debt, 3 vaults remaining  Since the outstanding debt is insignificant relative to available liquidity, we recommend a flat LR increase which will trigger the liquidations. Therefore we are proposing to offboard fiat stablecoin vaults [USDC-A, USDP-A, GUSD-A] with the following parameters. Other parameters relevant to this vault types were previously already set here.  Set Liquidation Ratio to 1500% (Including USDC-A, USDP-A, GUSD-A)  The offboarding process will comply with MIP62 Collateral Offboarding Process. Next steps Assuming there are no objections from the community and governance to the offboarding proposals, we would prefer to proceed to the on-chain governance poll and subsequent executive vote.

The procedure defined in MIP62 will be followed. This means no liquidations will occur until at least 14 days following the closure of this poll. The Debt Ceiling for all these vaults is already 0, so that step will be skipped. In keeping with previous collateral offboardings, this proposal has been assigned a \u201chigh-impact\u201d tag. ",
