                    "content": "MIP#: XX Title: Volumetric Price Stabilization for Reducing Risk for new Assets Author(s): Sam Bacha (@sambacha) Contributors: Sam Bacha (@sambacha) , Manifold Finance / Freight Trust Type: Technical Status: Pre-MIP Discussion Date Proposed: 2020-12-25 Date Ratified: Dependencies: N/A Replaces: N/A License: SSPL-1.0 / AGPL  Volumetric Price Stabilization for Reducing Risk for new Assets Price Stability as a Service for New Asset Onboarding This proposal  provides a middleware layer for MakerDAO to enable \u2018almost any\u2019 ERC-20 asset to become a price stable (re: reduced volatility) asset that can enable it to be used as collateral for CDP\u2019s given requirements are met. NOTES: You can read the abridged whitepaper on HackMD at this link: https://hackmd.io/@sbacha/manifold Full whitepaper: https://github.com/manifoldfinance/evo Reference Implementation: https://github.com/manifoldfinance/documentation Deployment Contract: 0x766291bE965E6Ba5E77892Ac70034f6B264AE7ea (Rinkeby) Elevator Pitch EVO Protocol calculates an average transfer rate for all holders of an ERC20 asset. Movement of an asset (transfers and withdrawals) that are above the calculated average transfer rate incur a fee. This fee is redistributed to all holders. Transfers and Withdrawals below the average transfer rate incur no fee. Think of this is a \u2018Uber Surchage\u2019 or a \u2018401 K Penalty\u2019 imposed on bulge bracket transactions. In essence this can serve as a anti rug pull mechanism if so desired.The fees imposed on such transactions can be redistributed to a Mutual Assurance Fund that can act as an insurance vault to further protect the MakerDAO Ecosystem or can be returned to all deposit addresses as a form of Non Inflationary Staking Rewards. Only the period of recalculation, the Market Period / Contract Rollover, is pre-determined. No admin key, no other centralized form of control exists in the EVO Protocol. Minting works much like aDAI or cDAI, we use the prefix. mkr- to denote assets that have been deposited into the protocol. EVO Protocol Please Note this is a very abridged overview, please read the HackMD or the Full Whitepaper for a more indepth overview! EVO Protocol, short of Embedded Volumetric Optionality, is a price stabilizing (re: accelerating / decelerating) middleware protocol that enables almost any ERC-20 asset to reach price stability. It achieves this by managing volume. The token price is determined dynamically(and individually for each holder) based on the information stored or updated in the smart contract during previous transactions giving us the equation:  The above equation will compute the price for a holder [h] to purchase a certain amount of EVO tokens in exchange for a base deposit in ETH/WETH at the given discrete time - [t +1] , where [Dt] stands for the deposit of ETH in the smart contract at previous time - point and [St] stands for the total supply of EVO tokens so far. The first component with the token - base ratio [Dt/St] under the square root is the indicative price and does not depend on the purchase/transferred amount, a. Ergo, the component [I_{t+1}^{\\prime}(h, a)] is called the discounted interest rate and it can grow proportionally to a within a range of [[0, 0.24]] of $$a$$. Higher interest payouts can slow down, decelerate, the price movement. Interest rate determines how fast, or acceleration, such price can change depending on the market demand & supply pressure for EVO-based tokens. Interest[#] is computed individually for each EVO holder. 1194\u00d7164 20.3 KB 1156\u00d7166 22.5 KB Interest Rate  Ownership Rate  Discounted Interest Rate  Price dynamics of equation (1) depends on the transactions volume conducted by all of the involved market participants and bounded by  Therefore it can be expected that the demand for EVO Protocol based tokens like EVO-[ERC20] will be able to represent the demand for the underlying asset, whereas EVO-[ERC20] represents the value of the underlying asset as a derivative function of the base asset, the ERC-20 asset. (i.e.a fixed unit of account for the ERC-20 asset, e.g. What Gwei is to Ethereum.) Implementation Roadmap If MakerDAO Governance Adopts the proposal, which is to only allow assets to be considered for collateralization with this additional middleware layer, it does not enable Any asset to become automatically accepted, rather it allows any asset to add this functionality in their own asset proposal / onboarding application as currently defined by the current MIP for said Risk Assessment Manifold Finance, the entity behind EVO Protocol is willing to partner and commit to an ERC-20 asset that is willing to be the first asset that is collateralized under this method. Meaning Manifold Finance will contribute up to a certain amount of liquidity (re: holding the asset for a certain amount of time then unwinding its position under a pre-defined term). This agreement would have to be coordinated with both MakerDAO Governance and the ERC-20 Asset\u2019s Operational Entity (e.g. to procure said asset OTC for example / coordinate with the team in defining the parameters of both recalculation period, scope of holdings, etc). We stress that not every ERC-20 asset will \u2018instantly\u2019 become acceptable to the MakerDAO Ecosystem, rather that this approach vastly reduces price volatility for assets that are otherwise of a sound nature (i.e. offers both functional and utility, strong community, active development, other qualitative measures, etc). Additional safeguards such as a Mutual Assurance Fund can be implemented as a \u2018sandbox\u2019 for ensuring the overall robustness of the MakerDAO Ecosystem. This proposal seeks to first establish a willingness to consider such a solution before \u2018getting into the weeds\u2019.

The title of your reads \u201cStablecoin as a Service\u201d so I was expecting an article on stablecoins but that was the only place stablecoins were mentioned. But I get the concept of price stabilization.     sambacha:  Therefore it can be expected that the demand for EVO Protocol based tokens like EVO-[ERC20] will be able to represent the demand for the underlying asset, whereas EVO-[ERC20] represents the value of the underlying asset as a derivative function of the base asset, the ERC-20 asset.   This sentence above contains a typo? I am left a bit puzzled regarding the implementation of this. Manifold Finance will invest OTC style in a low volume ERC-20 token (generic token XYZ) and then make a price stabilized version of this token in the form of EVO-XYZ.  OK - but XYZ is not a ERC-721, not a stablecoin, not a real world asset so I am slighly at a loss about what type of coin or asset will fit into this. Could you maybe provide a worked-out example? Also - as far as I see it - how does Manifold Finance handle asset onboarding? From the looks of it is a fully manual process? ",

                    "content": "Thanks for the great questions, let me answer them right off the bat.   Nothing about the proposal necessitates a \u2018low volume\u2019 token, in fact market depth would be the first criteria I would use to evaluate potential candidates.   \u2018XYZ\u2019 does not need to be an ERC721, it remains an ERC20.   A real world example would be the following: ChainLink decides to experiment with proposal and commits to using a 30 day contract roll over for the \u2018mkr-LINK\u2019 contract market. Users deposit LINK into the contract market in order to be able to collateralize vaults / mint DAI / etc. Once deposited, the user receives their \u2018mkr-LINK\u2019, and can utilize it within the MakerDAO Ecosystem. Lets take a hypothetical example of depositing 2,000 LINK and receiving 2,000 mkr-LINK. Lets say the user decides to sell 1,500 of their mkr-LINK for some other asset. Let us also assume that the 30 day avg. transfer rate is 1,000. Their sale of 1,500 incurs a fee, a percentage fee proportional to the amount in excess of the average transfer rate (in this case, 1,500 - 1,000 = 500 is in excess). This fee is dynamically calculated based on all transfers for that time period thus far (this specific multiplier can be tied into other MakerDAO 'PIDs/Gauges/Levers/etc), lets say 50 mkr-LINK. This 50 mkr-LINK is redistributed to all other account holders proportionally. It can also be redirected to a \u2018mutual assurance pool\u2019 or some other insurance scheme or even a designated address. Manifold Finance can deploy the contracts, but it is not necessary for us to do so. We have an SDK for the protocol that will make it turn key, and besides the contracts are actually quite simple as they do not have additional features (e.g. there is no admin, there is no way to upgrade contracts, we tried to reduce the surface area as much as possible). We do not need to invest \u2018OTC\u2019 style, we only wanted to show our commitment to this sort of solution (since we are the ones proposing it). Thank you for your questions, please let me know If I did not answer any of them or if you would like further clarification. Yes, I notice now that title of the post doesn\u2019t reflect the content as it should. Really it should probably read something more baroque but I figured \u2018Stablecoin as a Service\u2019 was easier to get the idea digested for the community. ",

We are not adding friction , that implies that all users would encounter this mechanism, rather we are dynamically charging a certain set of transactions, namely transactions that exceed the trailing average transfer rate. Why would users want to use this? Well for MakerDAO it would reduce price risk by having a middleware layer that diffuses price swings. For users of the protocol by itself, it can afford some protections against rug pulls. However, this all assumes that the traded asset has some \u2018intrinsic\u2019 worth, meaning there is some functional or utilitarian purpose for using the asset other than as a unit of account for payments. The correspondence between the ERC-20 and the \u2018evo\u2019-ERC-20 shouldn\u2019t deviate by any significant measure. The reason for this is there will exist an arbitrage opportunity (hence these will trend to zero in terms of a price differential). The best way to think of this is in terms of acceleration and deacceleration. Price swings still happen,  but over a more gradual period of time (like speeding up or slowing down). We want velocity (i.e. volume) to be the penalizing factor, not price. Like I said, this is what I would call a soft proposal, We first want to make sure that what we are suggesting, is in fact viable, then making sure there is community support behind it. At the end of the day if the Ecosystem doesn\u2019t use it, it serves no purpose then. ",

It is ment to be a hedge against price risk for transaction costs (hence the inclusion of the word \u2018Gas\u2019).   The transfer rates can be historically examined. If you do not want to pay the imposed surcharge you must wait until the next \u2018rollover date\u2019. Rollover date\u2019s are defined at the market\u2019s creation. As of version one this is a fixed constant, for version 2 we plan on implementing a function that can be modified.   Additionally, I am working on some Pytests for simulating extreme events so that the community may better asses the protocol from a more informed standpoint. If you would like to see simulations along with examining a specific asset so that historical backtest can be applied we would be happy to do so! ",
