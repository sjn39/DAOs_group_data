Now that things have cooled down, it\u2019s time to revisit the GSM & Dark Spell discussion that we started back in February. Link to the original \u201cDark Fix\u201d discussion. To better fit Maker nomenclature, specifically the spell, we\u2019ll refer to the fix going forward it as the \u201cdark spell.\u201d As many of you are aware, the GSM delay was reduced from 24 to 4 hours during the downturn. We\u2019ll start the discussion tomorrow on how we want to proceed with any changes to the GSM delay. The second topic of discussion is the dark spell social layer. Three methods were proposed back in February. We\u2019d like to walk through those methods again, start collecting feedback on the community\u2019s preferred solution, and begin formalizing the process. Link to tomorrow\u2019s slides can be found here. Discussion will start during the G&R meeting and overflow will continue in this thread. Looking forward to starting this discussion again! The Three Models (1) Major MKR Holders Model The developer team reaches out to a pre-selected committee of MKR holders and shares the details about the critical vulnerability and patch. The selected committee of MKR holders would then sign a transaction confirming support for the proposed dark spell solution. Advantages  Dev team (current or EPC) interacts directly with pre-selected committee. Number of people with knowledge of the bug kept to a minimum.  Disadvantages  High trust required that the dev team / MKR holder committee does the right thing. MKR holder committee may not have the technical acumen or feel comfortable vouching for proposed fix. Potential conflicts of interest.  Implementation Details  Criteria for the MKR holder committee  Number of members? When to select new committee?   Iterate with the community to define a formal document outlining the steps to be followed. Decide avenue of communication with large MKR holders.  (2) Independent Auditor Attestation Model An agreement is signed with an independent auditor (IA) in advance to perform an audit when the need arises. When a critical vulnerability is detected, the dev team reaches out to the pre-approved auditor who will vet and vouch for the dark spell solution. Advantages  Dev team (current or EPC) interacts with dedicated, specialized auditor with contractual agreement in place. Community + MKR holder input on the process. Number of people with knowledge of the bug kept to a minimum.  Disadvantages  The dev team and the IA are fully entrusted authorities over entire system and all of its assets. Costs of having attestation agreement with auditor. Centralized, with Maker governance oversight.  Implementation Details  Criteria for the IA relationship:  What do we want from an auditor? How to select the auditor(s)?   Obtain community input on criteria to select IA. Community vets and approves IA, and can replace or amend IA relationship with governance vote. More flexibility to design a process. For example, the community, and not just MKR holders, select one or more independent auditors at time of bug discovery to examine the fix alongside a pre-approved list of auditors.  (3) Community Appointed Trusted Party Model When the development team is ready with the bug fix implementation, the community will be asked to appoint an independent trusted party to attest to the validity of the vulnerability and the dark spell solution. Advantages  Dev team (current or EPC) informs the community which then spearheads the efforts to determine a trusted party (technical details of bug are not revealed). Largely community driven.  Disadvantages  Publicly communicating that a bug exists in the system. Community may take extended time deliberating on a solution. Reactionary (there would be no independent attestor in place). No agreements in place beforehand.  Implementation Details  Iterate with community to define formal process to follow once a bug has been identified. This is a reactive process. The dev team will communicate that a bug has been discovered and will work with the community to find a resolution that works for the particular situation.  ",

With a committee of MKR holders I would want them to be public about their involvement in potential dark fixes. Otherwise I see to many opportunities for insider trading. Actually regardless with them being public, there are still many opportunities for profiting on that information, so seems a bit tricky. I am a little confused with the community driven solution presented here, but what I was envisioning is that potentially we could vote on individuals in the community who would be disclosed the information in a dark fix scenario. I guess ideally we would want to vote for people with strong technical backgrounds, active presence in the community and ideally don\u2019t hold a ton of MKR. One issue is that we cant guarantee that those people would be around once a dark fix emergency actually happens. Either way, mkr or community committee, having a plan b for the social side seems like a good idea, maybe thats where the independent auditors could come in? I am assuming the devs have relationships with auditors who could fill that role. Also we should do a practice dark fix to test the technical aspect and whatever other mechanisms we eventually settle on. Thanks for the presentation Wil! ",

                    "content": "Just adding my comments in the CC side bar here as a placeholder. I really liked the 3 choices offered Independant auditor, Community group, and MKR backed group. First point is that this should be written up as a MIP. Regarding issues, trust, and mechanics\u2026   Think about MKR stake bonding + MKR governance promise backing on issues. Since this requires significant community trust (it did in the past and will continue to do so into the future) I think the greatest trust is placed in MKR.   I think an interesting solution to the trust issue is to have entities who want to do this work to put up a MKR bond of some reasonable size which can be used to slash claims against for access to this kind of Maker community work paid with a commensurate fee (this isn\u2019t just doing very demanding, time critical work, but a real insurance bond has to be posted to access the market on top of everything else). This MKR bond can come from the community, or by some form of promise delegation.  Whether and how much to actually stake vs. promise as trust support is a different issue. There issues here which we have already discussed.  Secrecy is required in all aspects of discovery, implementation, testing, deployment.  An organization doesn\u2019t want have advertised a potential exploit before fixing it. Often times there is a urgent time element (this breaks down into exploit is being used NOW, vs. could be used at any time, or under X,Y,Z conditions) 1+2 usually lead to a huge trust component which often necessitates forms of insurance to satisfy the failure of trust elements.  I think it would be important for the system to have at least two independent bonded parties put up MKR be bonded by some MKR holder so on at least this important issue we have no less than a minimum of 2 independent parties signing off. Finally as I said while this may not be ideal - I think this whole thing should be written up as a formal MIP.   We can talk about this but I know a lot of people are going to be focusing on \u2018how do we trust A,B, or C in this process\u2019.   How does governance even vote on such a thing.   My point with the bonding above is that if we can get like 50+K MKR to back multiple parties on this - the governance part is simply a formalization of the work it is a kind of governance/MKR holder supported done deal from a governance perspective.  Doing the vote typically will only be a formality. Remember how we had this CC saying we needed this \u2018dark fix\u2019 etc. from the foundation.  Everyone was like - well what do we need it for - what is the risk we are looking at - and really no questions could be answered regarding any details.   Everyone basically had to trust foundation, and in the end MKR voting for it did\u2026   I think with a kind of bonding stake amount + a MKR voting support delegation we could literally solve the actual \u2018governance mechanics\u2019 and \u2018trust issue\u2019 directly - as can best be done with the current governance configuration with the above 3 constraints applied. I think this will and should inspire a lot of serious governance discussion because this issue of MKR doing stuff directly connects to trust in the system and what this means when Maker foundation is formally dissolved. All I have at the moment I may think of more. ",

Help me understand this better:  Multiple MKR holders stake X tokens. This group of MKR holders has oversight on the governance process to vet an auditor set. Independent auditors attest that there is a vulnerability and the suggested patch fixes it. Critical bug is fixed. Independent auditors are paid for their services. Staked MKR holders receive commensurate compensation for the risk they\u2019ve taken on in this role.  Abstracting away the stringent details, I\u2019m trying to better understand the compensation breakdown for people who stake and how they will be incentivized to act given a critical bug is discovered.

Why are we not including a discussion regarding my suggestion to have a MKR seasoning period before MKR can enter governance in particular and whether this kind of approach could work.     MKR seasoning proposal for system control access       Greetings Maker community.  There is a lot going on and my apologies to add but I wanted to get this idea off my plate for risk-governance consideration as well as community consideration.  There has been a lot of discussion about attack vectors in the Maker system.  I have in my own analysis identified two primary attack vectors that I outline quickly below.    General governance attack via obtaining sufficient MKR.   The first line of defense for the MCD here that has been recently enacted is \u2026     Someone who has an idea can they ELI5 to the rest of us what we are being protected against by this GSM delay that a \u2018MKR seasoning approach\u2019 can\u2019t solve.   Why is instant access to all MKR control functions (including the ES btw) so bloody important that we then have to apply a GSM to pause the changes by MKR governance and leaving the system exposed to what I will call a ES attack by 50K wild MKR. Wouldn\u2019t a better approach be to  Have some idea of whether MKR in governance is acting appropriately and can be \u2018trusted\u2019 within governance to steward the system properly for all MKR holders.  (this may include people who are voting within governance to stand up and be accounted for in some polling mechanism and tracking of MKR entering the system). Have some control over a timeframe that wild MKR has to season in a wallet to limit entrance to governance and therefore effectively limit all governance attacks to ones that \u2018take time\u2019 to execute. Set the GSM to a reasonbly short (if not elminate it completely) delay before the HAT can be moved and spells set to execute. Allow only MKR in governance to access MKR control functions including ES.  There is an addendum here that I thought of recently is that the GSM basically could be somewhat dynamic in that if say MKR at the level of last hat enters the system the GSM even with the seasoning rule applied is automatially put up to 24hrs.  But if MKR has not changed in governance by any significant amount over the past 30days say lower the GSM literally to zero. In this kind of model Maker potentially gets the best of both worlds. I am going to add something regarding circuit breakers btw.    Why are we not including a minting circuit breaker that has no delay like the auction/liquidation delay.   From what I can see if we stop auctions and minting of DAI we effecively \u2018halt\u2019 the system in total we close the surface area for attack pretty nicely.   The only other attack is a collateral extraction attack which if we are paranoid we could and should put in the system a collateral withdrawal circuit breaker which pretty much gives the HAT the ability to literally freeze the system in a single spell (stop auctions, minting, and collateral withdrawal) effectively halting the system without ESing it.

                    "content": "I pretty much agree having the dynamic GSM to MKR deposited def not the best KISS solution. There really needs to be a whole discussion regarding how the community trusts MKR in the governance contract to actually carry out system actions and what is a reasonably governance delay when foundation dissolves.   Since this whole idea of 50+K MKR even waiting 30 days to execute what they want basically backstops with someone catching the \u2018badHAT\u2019 within the GSM delay period. This remined me that if the foundation dissolves the community is going to need a Maker operations group that watches the system 24/7/365 with 1 deep redundancy like a hawk and can flag important MKR holders action is required.  This all literally has to happen within the GSM delay (which I agree we probably need). IF we can effectively halt the system or relevant portions until we can square away a goodHAT governance action then basically we only need to practice (via firealarm kinds of drills) in what time frames we can muster MKR to vote.   Literally this would be a kind of \u2018firealarm\u2019 executive that we simply put up to see how long it takes for our governance MKR to act and use this data to fine tune the GSM delay. What do we have left in the basket of tricks if someone gains control of the HAT. I have it as. delayed by GSM HAT control and spell execution. HAT override spell (has to be caught and governance executed within the GSM btw) Immediate and basically one auction circuit breaker which requires governance to execute. ES the system which is effectively immediate and irrevokable. All of these actions necessairly require MKR to act via governance and construct/execute spells except ES. Now it might be interesting to have a feature that even 1000-5000 MKR could execute one of the halt spells.   This way we just need \u2018semi trusted\u2019 agents that can halt pieces of the system at any time.  If the halt was found by the community to be improper or malicious just slash the Maker - re-enable and move on.  In fact this kind of control would be a perfect thing to test operational response on. A firealarm test can be someone with the required MKR to trigger a stop on liquidations and then see how long it takes for someone else to fire up an executive or to sent the alert for governance response and how long it takes to evaluate and re-enable   In the end if this was determined to be a risk or operations team designed firealarm test the MKR governance response MKR is restored and the data collected to asses - governance response. This is purely an operational characterization\u2026 We put in a liquidation circuit breaker in literally what days.   I really think we should seriously consider ability to halt DAI minting, as well as collateral removal and to have this action to be enablable by some amount of MKR that could get slashed after the fact (i.e. it stays in a contract until governance restores or slashes). BTW:  The incentive for reporting and action on these tests can be the reporter, system informer basically get a fee for performing a system response function.   Eventually this stuff could and should be somewhat automated.  MKR holders with governance MKR also submit a way to contact so once a system alert is triggered software basically automates the propagation of the \u2018system alert\u2019 to relevant governance participants to act.   Given we will probably need a lot of governance participation and fast response I honestly think we need to consider compensation for governance participants performing these operations monitoring and response functions - they will by necessity be doing a lot of work potentially at any hour or day of the year.

                    "content": "I am going to put this here but I think it will deserve its own thread. This whole idea of depositing MKR into a slashable contract to operate Maker system functions.  Conceptually given how Maker functions I think this whole deposit MKR to access system function is probably the most realistic solution to access and control issues within the scope of operations and coupled to full governance audit MKR return with reward or potentially slashe The plusses of this are:  Value model for holding MKR goes far beyond just asset value growth but actually has a real return with respect to operational payout for accessing and performing necessary MKR operations functions. MKR is effectively held in the operational system as collateral against last function accesses until governance releases (this will happen in normal MKR governance cadence cycles)  Example from the above.  To access MKR system halting functions say it only costs 1k maker to execute the contract.  This 1K MKR basically is the \u2018hurdle\u2019 to be able to \u2018operate\u2019 an important MKR lever.   Payout for valid execution of this function (determined by governance after the fact) returns some DAI as payment.  If the function was found to be executed maliciously - slash a fraction (penalty) or the whole (if really malicious).  This MKR sits in the system, with more MKR deposited to activate HAT and reverse the halt action.  Both of these groups of MKR basically sit in the system itself \u2018in operation\u2019 and should not be allowed to be removed btw.   MKR supporting a currently valid HAT or action stays locked until the next action happens and then is released for potential withdrawal (one just removes votes from HAT(s) to remove MKR from governance) and governance itself releases MKR in the system working to perform important system functions. Conceptually using this idea of having system access put up MKR deposits is attractive because this reflects the higher level governance philosophy as it works in practice.   The MKR deposited in these contracts all should have ability to vote in governance btw while they \u2018work\u2019 to earn fees in the system. The simplest way I can put it is that you could use the idea that MKR is the electricity that powers access to decentralized MKR function market access.   Literally all MKR functions could operate this way.  In the end governance decides to reward or punish the MKR accessing and attempting to perform functions based on some rule metric in force via governance(MIPs).   This way the only people/MKR who get to access greater functions have to have progressively higher grouped real deposited representations of MKR.   50K to ES, what 75K for HAT, ?K darkfix maybe 1-5K for the halt level and Iam control\u2026   I think the characters accessing these functions must show consistent MKR ownership (why the whole seasoning thing) and then actually deposit the MKR electricity to operate the system (i.e. only governance MKR can perform these functions?!).  Ideally we want the EPCs controlling some of this or delegated MKR agents that actually are bonded with MKR they can deposit into the system to access controls. Doing it this way completely encapsulates the governance into an operations access/responsibility/accountability metric - directly in MKR - the financial power behind MKR. In principle I think we can solve a lot of governance actions, and operations issues using this model.  How much MKR (I am ok with using closest fixed numbers until MKR float substantially changes - and adjust as these move 2x out of bounds or some other amount) is open to debate but we already have HAT, ES, DarkFix levels set. I have to think about this one but it just hit me today.   This has to have been discussed with Maker governance inception (idea to deposit MKR to do HAT actions, create spells, cast spells, whatever).  Each step leaves a deposited MKR trail that governance in full audits and either penalizes or rewards (this can be as simply as return of MKR and a warning for a infraction, to a full slash of deposit, to an actual reward for people providing important services - dark fixes for example - would require the highest deposits to activate). Something to put in the bucket of ideas for how to solve some of the real decentralization and Maker foundation dissolution issues that will be facing us. My gut reaction to the above is it can\u2019t be that easy! Certainly there would be rework of governance and contracts required.  Does the above leave a hole in the above idea as a model that causes attack vectors.   Off the top of my head I can\u2019t think of them because we are going to need important functions and I can\u2019t think of any other proper signalling metric given Maker governance OTHER than depositing MKR itself. BTW:  I posted this before because I have been part of the reddit /r/ethtrader little DONUTS/CONTRIB dual token governance experiment reddit has chosen to roll out across subreddits.  The idea of secondary MKR tokens to go along with the MKR primary financial ones either independently or in combination offer significant enhancements to above idea of using MKR + secondary MKR_RISK MKR_OPERATION,  MKR_CONTRIB effectively tokens to activate and pool with MKR financial ones literally opens up the above MKR financial staking model to activity representation via secondary associated tokens creates all kinds of additional governance mechanics. I will leave this for today.  Apologies for length but it felt important on this topic to set down somewhere anywhere and try to get my head back into more difficult issues - liquidation report. ",

This is a big refactoring.

I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking how to pilot staking mechanisms. In the context of the Major MKR Holder model, the foremost challenge I see is creating an incentive for holders to stake on.

The Major MKR Holders need to validate that the dark spell does the right thing. It is quite demanding to ask these large MKR holders to then stake their valuable assets and risk slashing on an issue they do not feel comfortable being apart of. I think it\u2019s much less demanding to simply ask for their vote. These large holders will wonder why do we put our assets as risk for a vulnerability we did not create. If we designed a smart contract to perform this reward or slashing arrangement, what\u2019s going to make large MKR holders want to deposit their MKR into it? How does this presumably modular contract fit into the current MCD architecture? ",

                    "content": "To move this discussion along, I\u2019d like to suggest that we draft an initial one-page policy document for handling a dark spell. This policy can be expanded upon as we continually improve our governance processes. Should a critical bug be discovered, the Smart Contracts team would develop and test the dark spell. The dark spell would then be communicated to the community. There are few different paths we can follow here: with the provided info the community can select one of the above methods, can do community Q&A, the community can nominate someone to get a more detailed briefing and attest to the validity, or the community can simply give the go-ahead to schedule and cast the dark spell as soon as possible. Given the ambiguity of such a sensitive situation, I propose that we keep this initial policy document very straightforward and mirror the process above. As a member of the SC team, I (or any other team member for that matter) can be the liaison with the community and work to build consensus on how to resolve the bug. Once consensus is reached, the dark spell is scheduled and cast, and a detailed post-bugfix document explaining the changes will be made available. I\u2019ll draft this initial one-page policy and post it here, and will provide ample time (also consider the amount of time we\u2019ve already dedicated to this and the other ongoing initiatives requiring community input) for community comment. Another thing to consider is that as EPCs join the protocol, and the MF gradually steps back, this policy document will need to updated as governance processes calcify. ",

What if we had different levels of GSM delays depending on the number of mkr backing a spell? This gets around any issues of centralization, electing individual holders, etc. Since most spells are passed with a relatively small amount of mkr backing them what if we had something like:  normal parameters for spells passing: 24 hr GSM 30% of all mkr backing: 4 hr GSM 50% of all mkr backing: 10 min GSM  These are just examples. I don\u2019t know what the actual percentages should be here, and there would be a good amount of risk/viability analysis needed here. But this seems like a good category of solutions that keeps our roots as a decentralized entity and doesn\u2019t create unnecessary bureaucracy. This also has the potential to incentivize a high level of engagement from mkr holders ",
