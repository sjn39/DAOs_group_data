It comes down to committed community members participating day in and day out, on the Governance and Risk analysis of the DAO\u2014but, a lack of participation and un-involvement by certain MKR token holders(Whales)\u2014who do not participate, \u201cday in, day out\u201d in the future of this community\u2014for whatever reason that may be. Some community members believe there is nothing wrong with the lack of participation. Others will disagree. With that in mind\u2014should the most committed Maker Community Members\u2014regardless of the number of MKR Tokens they own & use to participate in governance\u2014day in, and day out\u2014be given the ability to have Voting Power multiplied by the time the Voter has Locked their tokens X the number of times they have Voted in the last 12 months?      Yes, I have participating day in, day out on the future of Maker, therefore I should have more Voting Weight   No, I\u2019ll stick to Warren Buffet\u2019s motto of She/He who has more \u201cSkin in the Game\u201d should have the most say in the success of Maker   It does not matter because Whales will always Rule the World   Abstain      0 voters     ",

There is an average of ~30 voters or so. And if you have, say, 50MKR, your vote doesn\u2019t really count (much/at all). Look at the evidence here: https://catflip.co/voting We have a SourceCred system in place. It is imperfect and still under test. So I am not suggesting to do anything NOW nor URGENTLY. But I would find it normal if the vote of top Community members was weighted up proportionally to their CRED. REMARK: Regarding the W. Buffet\u2019s  She/He who has more \u201cskin in the game\u201d should have the most say in the success of Maker.  You\u2019d still need to have skin in the game. Your vote would only be multiplied, not created out of thin air. And arguably, getting a lot of CRED requires a lot of \u201cskin in the game\u201d. In fact, I argue, much more \u2018skin\u2019 than just a few clicks on Uniswap (if you are a whale). ",

Let me quote myself here, because I think there is a relevant discussion I started a few days ago (but didn\u2019t receive any comments so far\u2026): Question about \"Buying votes\" - Danger? If we only value wealth (i.e., MKR holdings) and not trustworthiness (e.g., CRED), we are arguably more exposed to governance attacks: any crazy whale (or attacker) can buy (or borrow for just a few minutes, just before the vote\u2019s end) a lot of MKR and render the vote of small players useless, effectively.
