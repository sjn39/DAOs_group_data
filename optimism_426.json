While the Channel is targeted towards DeFi in general, there are a number of tutorials specifically dedicated to Optimism and the Dapps on its platform. The tutorials are clear and effective, i.e. they allow a newbie to understand and use previously unfamiliar Dapps, confidently, in a matter of minutes. That is, his tutorials work, they are not fluff with silly thumbnails, and they are dedicated to learning the skills to access Defi and not about getting rich quick from crypto. The Channel is also multilingual, which is a strong positive in the spirit of inclusion, diversity and decentralisation. The Subli Defi Channel has a low level of Subscribers and thus isn\u2019t likely getting the reward deserved from YouTube monetisation. Thus, I think the RPGF is a good alternative to recognise the impact it is having, and can have in the future. Links to Project: https://www.youtube.com/@Subli_Defi (The YouTube Channel) https://twitter.com/Subli_Defi (Twitter) Contact info for the project or project lead: I don\u2019t know their contact info. Although he is in this forum: @Subli_Defi Note 1: I don\u2019t know if they want to participate. I assume they\u2019ll have to \u2018Opt-in\u2019? Note 2: After just looking up their Twitter for this nomination, I see they describe themselves as a \u201cOptimism Ambassador\u201d so I\u2019m not sure if that disqualifies them from eligibility. I honestly just liked and used their YouTube tutorials to learn a few new things, everyone so far has been nominating themselves, so I wanted to nominate them. I\u2019ll let everyone else take it from here. ",

We provide a comparison of the various Ethereum L2 systems available today. An important differentiator between L2BEAT and similar sites is that L2BEAT is committed to educating users and lists only projects that match our narrow definition of L2. We define layer two as a chain that fully or partially derives its security from layer one Ethereum so that users do not have to rely on the honesty of L2 validators for the security of their funds. Because of our commitment to education we present various non-trivial metrics aside from Total Value Locked (TVL).

Over the past year I have built up a pseudonymous identity on Twitter shedding a light on all the wrong doing that goes on in the Crypto/NFT space. The topics I\u2019ve researched range from insider trading, rug pulls, undisclosed promotions, & other unethical behavior. After falling victim to similar things as a newcomer during the last crypto bull-run cycle I began to experience deja vu as I noticed it all start to occur once again. I eventually became fed up and decided to research and document the shady things that go on to hopefully educate as many people as possible and increase transparency in the space. What began as just one Tweet quickly evolved into something much larger. My work has been featured in places such as Bloomberg, Vice, NYT, & many more. Most of my time is spent researching leads using on-chain tools (Breadcrumbs, various blockchain explorers, & Nansen) as well as other tools (Twitter search, Archive org, YouTube, etc). A good percent of the leads either end up not being worthwhile or where I am unable to reach a conclusion. All findings are then openly shared with my Twitter audience. All funding received will go to equipment upgrades, future legal costs, and to whatever you value my time working about 8+ hours daily, researching & answering as many people as humanly possible. All of my work thus far has gone unpaid besides a donation address I set up at the end of January.

For the first time in history, ITU Blockchain published Solidity training in Turkish, which lasts more than 34+ hours completely for free of charge. Before, despite the high interest in cryptocurrencies in Turkey there was limited access to resources to build and develop this technology. Thanks to this training we have reached around 50,000 views, hundreds of people learned Solidity and participated in hackathons. The resources used in all our trainings are shared as open-source. All the codes and resources in our Solidity training are also shared on Github. In addition, Optimism and dApps on Optimism are one of the networks/dApps we use in our trainings.  announce1280\u00d7720 80.8 KB  In addition, ITU Blockchain is the community that conducts the most comprehensive face-to-face training on blockchain in Turkey. Every year, face-to-face trainings are held on Blockchain 101, Blockchain Advanced, DeFi, NFT, Layer 2s and DAO. These trainings are open to everyone. Anyone who wishes can attend the training without pre-registration. Since our trainings are the most qualified face-to-face trainings, more than 150-200 people attend each training. Especially in Layer2s training, a lot of information is given about Optimism.  FDSgWQuWYAUVgsO2048\u00d71536 449 KB  In addition, ITU Blockchain has been publishing and sharing crypto money and blockchain news every week for almost 3 years in a way that can be read in 5 minutes. It sends news to nearly 4000 newsletter subscribers by e-mail every week under the name of Genesis News. ITU Blockchain has also participated in dozens of hackathons so far. The most important of these are ETH Bogota, ETH Mexico, ETH Berlin, ETH Barcelona, ETH Prague, ETH Online and Avalanche Barcelona Hackathon. They have won awards from many of these hackathons. They developed many hackathon projects organized by ETH Global on Optimism and was nominated for Optimism awards.

Optimism\u2019s Layer 2 solution is almost fully compatible with the EVM, though it uses an \u201coptimistic\u201d EVM called the OVM. The main difference between the EVM and the OVM that developers will notice is that some opcodes are not available for contracts that are deployed to the OVM.

Optichads is a wellness and health minded community of optimism users that utilize basic psychology to help fuel healthy habits in a positive way. The thesis behind optichads is that your chad is a vehicle of motivation because of the artwork when a person looks at a chad and does a comparison, they see the chad like features to be a potential goal. This coupled with the congregation of like minded people leads to better health and wellness for chad holders. I personally have experienced greater motivation for health and wellness just by being in the community. The last RGF benefitted Optichads and was a success for their proof of physical work for distribution to the diverse set of chad holders. Optichads is the largest original pfp project on optimism with vibrant, knowledgeable community members, rewarding Optichads would be rewarding optimism, dedication, and motivation for physical and mental health and wellness. There are countless conversations within the community about the mental benefit from getting strong. The endorphins help a lot of people be healthier mentally and physically. It would behoove optimism to have governance members that value mental and physical health and wellness. Down below I linked Optichads episode on OP Radio, which can provide a wealth of more resources on the project:      twitter contacts: OptiChads Dicaso5 website:   OptiChads   Optichads With a cheap public mint and 50% donated to retroactive public goods, Optichads proves it cares about the community.

He has done this by writing articles, papers and presenting at conferences to help explain how rollups work to a technical (and at times general) audience. For example, even the idea that a rollup is a special type of bridge, and all we are working on is bridge engineering, is slowly coming into the terminology used by rollup projects. A lot of it seems obvious, but his writings has helped shaped that narrative. Some of the articles include two SoKs on layer-2 protocols (one from 2018 and another in 2021), an online class dedicated to layer-2, several blog posts about mental models of bridges / rollups as an sdk. For presentations, he has iterated on the same talk about rollups which was presented at Ledger, Devcon, a16z, L2beats, BanklessDAO, etc. Alongside a host of non-recorded talks, panels and general shilling of technical explainers/discussion on twitter. He isn\u2019t associated with any rollup projects - which is why his content is so good, educational and honest. It is a bit strange that he does it all for free. Which is why it would be great to nominate him for this retrospective grant.  A link to the project\u2019s GitHub or Twitter: https://twitter.com/stonecoldpat0/   ",

I create quality design that attracts people, increases the reach of the posts and thus I deliver important information to online users. Yes, I do not have many subscribers now, but look at their activity and engagement.  After all, it\u2019s quality, not quantity, that matters. At the request of my audience, I started work on an NFT collection that has no analogues - \u201cOptimism CULT\u201d. It will be a collection of 780 hand-drawn NFT cultists, each with a unique design. Each of my posts is hand-drawn, with love ! In the future, this NFT collection will be integrated into the pixel P2E game I\u2019m working on the concept of, in parallel with the creation of the NFT collection. Since I haven\u2019t seen any games on Optimism yet, its unique design will make it \u21161 and be able to compete with the top games that are created on other blockchains. Part of the proceeds will be used to hire psychologists who will provide counseling. (After all, psychological health is very important). In addition, I\u2019ve created a small line of designs for Optimism merch. Soon I will start to actively promote it and distribute branded clothing in my region.

Without their warm welcomes and fast answers, our Discord would not be the kind and accessible space it is today. The NERDs responsibilities range from moderation to support, sharing important information, reporting & removing scams, keeping the peace and spreading the ever important optimistic vibe . As such, the Optimism Foundation is nominating the NERDs for retroactive public goods funding. The NERD program has been running for just over a year now. As such, there are NERDs who have come and gone leaving lasting impact behind them, as well as new NERDs who are only just beginning. We strongly believe in rewarding those who help make Optimism the ecosystem we all know it could be  This proposal aims to distribute any allocated funding in the following ratios: NERDs in training: 1 Alumni NERDs: 2 Support NERDs: 2.5 For example, if we have one of each NERD, and this proposal receives 100 OP, the NERD in training would get 18.18 OP, the Alumni would get 36.36 OP, and the active support NERD would get 45.45 OP. The list of Nerds can be seen here Collection Link You can find the NERDs in the Optimism Discord, read more about a NERD responsibilities here  Disclaimer: Collections, a term used to describe projects without a single person or entity that can be verified via GitHub or Twitter, may only be nominated by the Optimism Foundation.

This undertaking is no trivial task, but the Optimism community has taken it on with grace and speed. The Optimism user docs, which help users with guides and information on lots of important topics (such as setting up your metamask wallet, how to bridge, how Optimism works, etc). There are two main categories of translators: Those who contributed to our Crowdin to translate user documentation, and those who translated articles, Tweets, and other blogs. While this nomination is covering both types, going forward translations of articles and tweets will not be rewarded as they are now, as a more structured program will be rolled out. For this nomination, only Crowdin translators who were proofreaders (approved translations) will be considered. This choice was made as a reflection of participation (translation amounts drop off dramatically as you can see for yourself in CrowdIn). Later this year the translation program will be overhauled to include sufficient rewards for translators. The Article translators list may not be complete, as we are only able to see the translations that get posted in Discord. This proposal aims to distribute any allocated funding in the following ratios: Proofreader: 2 Article translator: 1.9 - 1* For example, if we have one of each translator, and this proposal receives 100 OP, the Proofreader would get 66.66 OP and the Article translator would get 33.33 OP.

Token engineers design, validate and optimize token economic systems. We understand that the systems and algorithms we build impact people and must foster responsibility and uphold the values of the broader institution of professional engineering. At the Token Engineering Academy (TE Academy) the mission is to establish token engineering as a recognised professional discipline. TEA see token engineering as a fundamental requirement of the broader web3 ecosystem and work (amongst other things) to educate web3 contributors to the important role and responsibilities of token engineers In October 2022, they launched TE Fundamentals - a five part education program with NFT-based certification. Offered 100% online TE Fundamentals is free and available to anyone, anywhere. Results since October 2022 speak to the level of interest and need for this program  more than 1500 students enrolments 33 study group hosts across 14 languages 412 students have completed at least one exam requiring 96% pass rate. Many have complete multiple exams or the entire course.  All NFTs are minted on Optimism thanks to the support and work of Otterspace and General Magic. Personal perspective I am a student, study group lead and since completeing the course a more active, informed and confident contributor to the token engineering community. My learning continues, every week TEA offers opportunities to discover and apply, share and build knowledge in this space. The teams has done a brilliant job developing the community around TEA keeping us informed, engaged and connected and promoting the program\u2019s people and achievements. The course creators are experts in their respective feilds and I\u2019m so thankful to the wealth of knowledge being shared and created through courses, open research and discussion. I have paid thousands of dollars towards graduate and post grad. education for papers that do not come near to the level of interactive and applied learning as provided by TE Fundamentals program. Impact = Profit Although not Optimism specific, the token engineering discipline is applicable to any token based projects.  Developing this discipline will imo have significant cumulative impact for web3 ecosystems, including Optimism. I found my way here after minting my course NFTs and look forward to contributing where I can.

Week in Ethereum News has operated mostly continuously since 2016 and acts as a consistent, no-nonsense source of news about the Ethereum ecosystem. It aggregates all of the most interesting news, projects, and links about topics like \u201cStuff for developers\u201d, \u201cLayer 1\u201d, \u201cLayer 2\u201d, \u201cEIPs/Standards\u201d, and many many more. Week in Ethereum News is an institution. I believe it should be rewarded for its longevity and commitment to distributing digestible information about the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Week in Ethereum News\u2019s initials, \u201cWEN\u201d, are simply too on the nose in this situation. For such a clearly established educational institution in the space to receive funding via RetroPGF, I simply ask \u201cWEN?\u201d.

Truffle Suite is a collection of development tools that are designed to make it easier for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the key components of Truffle Suite is the Truffle Optimism Box, which provides developers with a boilerplate structure that they can use to start coding for Optimism\u2019s Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Optimism\u2019s Layer 2 solution is a scaling solution that aims to increase the throughput of the Ethereum blockchain by moving some of the computational work off-chain. It is almost fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), but it uses an \u201coptimistic\u201d version of the EVM called the OVM. The main difference between the EVM and the OVM that developers will notice is that some opcodes are not available for contracts that are deployed to the OVM. However, the Truffle Optimism Box comes with the Optimistic solc compiler already referenced in the truffle-config.ovm.js file, so developers can easily see a complete list of differences between Optimism\u2019s fork of the solc compiler and the original. With the Truffle Optimism Box, developers will be able to compile, migrate, and test Solidity code against several instances of Optimistic Ethereum networks. This makes it easy to get started building dapps on Optimism without having to write any specific sort of application. In conclusion, the Truffle Suite is a powerful collection of development tools that are designed to support the development and usage of the OP Stack. The Truffle Optimism Box provides developers with the necessary structure and tools to start coding for Optimism\u2019s Ethereum Layer 2 solution and make it easier to build and deploy dapps on the Ethereum blockchain.

A description of how the project has supported development and usage of the OP Stack :  Introduction  Optimism Espa\u00f1ol is a collaborative and open (unofficial) community dedicated to promoting the adoption of Optimism by disseminating information about its technology, ecosystem and governance processes in Spanish. Our goal is to reach all Latin American citizens and Spanish speakers in general, so that they can learn about the benefits of this Ethereum scaling solution.  How do we do it?  Optimism Espa\u00f1ol has been working on developing the Optimism ecosystem in Latin America through various activities for all types of users in different parts of the region. During 2022, we have disseminated online educational content through various platforms, such as Twitter, Discord and YouTube, both independently and in collaboration with other communities to increase our reach. We have also participated in events related to Ethereum and cryptocurrencies in general to promote Optimism\u2019s ethos and its innovative approach to governance. We have also kept our audience informed about protocol updates, governance and ecosystem news through our communication channels. We have also been responsible for translations of the articles in the official Optimism mirror. You can review our 2022 summary in our previous post, published by @NicoEsp:     Optimism en Espa\u00f1ol - 2022 Recap \ud83c\udfdb Governance       Hello there!  My name is Nico Espindola (A.K.A.

I was onboarded to OP through OAYC during their mint, I never knew OP existed\u2026 Lol, but with the OAYC mint (which was in $OP token), I was eager to know more about the OP ecosystem. The OAYC team also provided guides and documents that could help us get $OP tokens and many more guides. It was a great experience for my onboarding into the OP ecosystem\u2026 and I believe if OAYC is supported with this grant, they\u2019ll go a long way and achieve a lot that will in turn also help the ecosystem grow. The MOAYC mint (was done with $OP tokens) was done and the mutation event (where OAYC Apes turns into Mutant Apes) is also on. In few weeks, the OAYC staking will be live and this is another way to help the ecosystem, as so many new NFT folks will learn how staking works with NFTs, the OAYC team will do well by providing every necessary guides for the community and when they stake their NFTs, they can earn both $OAYC and $OP tokens.   The team also has plans to build Utilities around the $OAYC tokens and would also build DApps in the future roadmaps. If granted, I\u2019m sure the team will be more motivated to leverage on their ideas.

Our program consists of 4 workshops with theoretical and practical content, where participants learn about personal finances, blockchain technology, and possible use cases including how Optimism works. We also facilitate access to decentralized technologies, by guiding participants through the creation of a Metamask wallet and a profile in Proof of Humanity, a social identity verification system for humans on Ethereum. By participating in our program, individuals receive a first-hand experience of the world of cryptocurrencies by receiving the UBI token and becoming part of a DAO. Our team is made up of professionals who share a passion for blockchain technology and a socially conscious outlook. We have already deployed 8 editions of #aPRENDOcripto in low-income neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina and have 110 graduates. Our plan is to deploy 26 more training programs in 2023, not only in Buenos Aires but also in the rest of Argentina and Uruguay. Our program has received recognition and support from the Ethereum Foundation through a grant and was selected as the most important public goods project of Latin America in last year\u2019s Devcon Quadratic Funding. Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, even attended one of our workshops. We are confident that #aPRENDOcripto aligns with the goals of RetroPGF 2, and we would be honored to receive funding support to continue our mission of spreading awareness and knowledge of blockchain technology and the Ethereum scalability.

The EthStaker team supports the broader Ethereum ecosystem directly through hosting live events, writing blog posts, leading technical workshops and even sometimes facilitating staking-related events in-person. The EthStaker community has led to a tangible increase in Ethereum\u2019s L1 security with a Layer 0 campaign on staking client diversity and continues to actively support Ethereum\u2019s security and robustness. Since the launch of the Beacon Chain, the EthStaker community has been the primary support channel for Ethereum Staking. Last year we helped prepare thousands of solo and institutional stakers in preparation for testnet and Mainnet merges. The team and community deliver this support, which is free and available to anyone, through moderated Discord and Reddit communities. This year, we are focused on preparing stakers everywhere for upcoming protocol changes such as withdrawals, and we continue to be a driving force for education, support and decentralization for Ethereum Stakers everywhere.

It represents the beginnings of the OP stack, as a social game world. It features protocols such as Synthetix, Velodrome, Opensea, Rainbow, PoolTogether, Perpetual, 1inch & Aave- as well as a town hall, museum, bank, hacker space & sports stadium (where for example Optichads have recently started hosting live workouts with anticipated OP incentives). Some of the spaces feature dApp integrations, and in the past thousands of users have explored the game world interacting with Optimism- completing educational quests to learn about and actually use flagship protocols. OP City is perfect for social events across the ecosystem where community admins, defined by wallet address, are able to start broadcast events within given interior worlds (ie Optimism Town Hall or Perpetual building) and promote / demote speakers with the addition of video chat & screen sharing. This is perfect for community calls since participants could even cast DAO votes, ie on Snapshot, inside of the world. We have recently built a super easy linking system to make events and worlds more accessible. You can also join as a guest or connect one of your social profiles, ie Twitter, instead of connecting your wallet. Mobile is coming soon. Beyond that, we\u2019re building things like Telegram / Discord bots and Chrome extensions so that both OP Labs, the ecosystem protocols that make up OP City & the wider OP community can easily use their custom Atlantis World spaces for meetings, gatherings, social events & co working every day with web3 layers on top.

The DAO has created multiple NFT collections on Optimism (both free and paid), and with new data reporting that the gateway to web3 is likely to be NFTs, Layer2DAO will continue to play a strong role in advocating for and growing the Optimism ecosystem. Layer2DAO also continues to work with other infrastructure projects to help them expand to Optimism through project partnerships, marketing support, and liquidity. These projects typically live on mainnet or Arbitrum. We offer projects to be the \u201cfirst customer\u201d on Optimism, acting as a trusted team to test their platform, provide feedback to help expand their Optimism offering, and serve as case-study to onboard other projects. Some tangible achievements include:  The first DAO-to-DAO swap on Optimism - completed between Layer2DAO and partner protocol Thales using Hedgey Finance\u2019s DAO tooling Compensation for Contributors to the DAO through the integration with partner protocol Wonderverse - a tooling platform for DAOs The first NFT staking on Optimism with ERC-20 rewards use-case, in conjunction with partner protocol GYSR Distributed 110000 OP so far from our initial Phase 0 grant to projects through the OPIncubator program to help projects onboard onto and/or grow their offering on Optimism  Layer2DAO has an active community focused on Layer 2 growth and continues to serve as a powerful vehicle for bringing new people and ideas to Optimism now and into the future.
