After conversations with @Protocol-Engineering and @GovAlpha-Core-Unit we made the call to not post an executive spell this week. The reasons for doing as are as follows:  The only item slated for the spell was Adopting DC-IAM for the PSM-USDC-A  Casting a spell requires quite a bit of labor and resources The Executive spell from last week has not passed yet  In short, the change we would be voting on is minimal and not of an urgent nature, so given the other factors, it seems more prudent to bundle the change with other proposals, most likely in next Friday\u2019s executive. The poll that approved the DC-IAM for the PSM-USDC-A Vault delivered expectations that it would be voted on within 30 days of passing the poll stage, and that is still the expectation following this delay.  image942\u00d7213 14 KB  We welcome any questions and concerns in this thread and my DMs are always open.

In general, we try to package as much into the weekly spell cycle as the Protocol Engineering team can handle. We\u2019re currently in an odd situation where there has been a lot of stuff passed, but we are still waiting back on audits and final reports (Sushi-LPs and RWA vaults to name a couple big ones). I\u2019ll be open to correction from @LongForWisdom on this part, but the general rule is that we follow the will of the voters and what was committed to during the polling and forum process. When exceptions happen we make a post (like this one) explaining why we made the call we did. It\u2019s hard to get more specific than that because any number of circumstances could cause an item, or even an entire spell, to be delayed. The PE team will not put in anything they are not 100% confident on for the code, and likewise GovAlpha will not force anything to the front end when circumstances dictate a better course of action is available.

And I\u2019d prefer to find out now when it doesn\u2019t matter than in the future when it might.   While I appreciate the desire to lock this down (so to speak) we\u2019ve seen in the past that having rules that are too strict can cause more harm than good. The general rule is that the Governance Facilitators (note this is not limited to GovAlpha facilitators) determine the contents of the weekly governance cycle (which includes the executive vote) and allow other mandated actors veto + inclusion rights within their domain of expertise. Someone needs to make this determination, because there is often not a \u2018correct\u2019 answer - stuff gets delayed, governance can vote for conflicting outcomes, urgent / emergency processes displace non-urgent and non-emergency processes. This is true even if you attempt to implement fixed rules because there will always be a situation that breaks them, and in that situation some entity / group needs to have the authority to decide how to move forward. That said, I\u2019m aware of the issues that ambiguity can cause as well, which is why each poll contains an outcomes section that clearly explains what the outcome should be to MKR Holders. If that outcome is not met, then they can and should make an issue of it. In this case the outcomes section reads:  image892\u00d7209 14.5 KB  Note that the 30 day clause was specifically added because at some point in the past, an outcome had stated \u2018this will be included in the next executive\u2019 and due to some combination of circumstances that wasn\u2019t possible - so I adjusted the default outcome text to allow us more flexibility in the future. TL;DR: Flexibility is good in this case. If a Governance Facilitator is viewed as malicious due to the misuse of this flexibility, they should be removed as soon as possible. ",

Surely that\u2019s not the intended structure?   Violently (so to speak.) If a mandated actor does not want to go quietly, it will get messy. Unfortunately there is no way to avoid that. To be clear, if governance put up a MIP to remove a mandated actor, Governance Facilitators aren\u2019t going to let the actor in question veto it. The only real issue takes place when the Governance Facilitators go rogue themselves. And even in this case is covered here: MIPs Portal  A governance facilitator emergency vote encodes one or more website URLs into an on-chain voting contract (spell), as well as containing logic that stops any payment stream to the existing governance facilitators. If the executive vote gets the most MKR votes and becomes the active proposal the existing Governance facilitators are then removed. The list of website URLs then corresponds to a list of one or more new Interim Governance facilitators and their governance platforms that will replace the current governance facilitators. The current governance cycle is canceled, and the new Interim Governance Facilitators initiate a new governance cycle on the following 1st Monday of the month.  Anyone is able to create an on-chain executive vote with the above properties, and there is nothing an existing Governance Facilitator can do to stop it getting voted on. ",
