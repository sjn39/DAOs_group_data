If we did that, the period would get set back to 0 or 1 and the amount of time between bomb diffusions would be maximized. Choosing 9,000,000 setback is arbitrary and depends on fork block which adds a bit of uncertainty that seems unnecessary. (It will set the period back to 1 most likely, though.) The arbitrary choice of 5,000,000 for the previous bomb diffusion is, I think, why the bomb is appearing so early this time. ",

Are you that scared of us? Block reward should go down There should be a commensurate decrease in the block reward with this change. Reading the references which are already presented in EIP-2385 (DRAFT) show the thinking that developed in the past when considering this same issue. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaI7680I4w&t=4888s You can hear Vitalik argue that reducing the block reward from 5 to 3 is appropriate if the price of Ether is above $10 or so. Well, we\u2019re well above $10 now. Reducing it again is appropriate. So far this has been a discussion point. But I will argue that the EIP draft is currently defective because the EIP-649 is cited as \u201cThe implementation in it\u2019s logic does not differ from EIP-649\u201d but the reward reduction is not even mentioned.

This one (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2387) says it will activate at block 9,200,000. This means that the fake_block will be 200,000. There\u2019s an issue with this in that fake_block is dependent on when the fork happens (forks have been delayed in the past). If, instead of being hard coded, the setback was (FORK_BLOCK - 200,000), then the delay would have no effect on how far back the bomb gets reset. This would make the statement in the Muir Glacier EIP that the bomb is difficult to model much less true. In the future, if we always reset the bomb to FORK_BLOCK - 200,000, it would predictably start to make itself known NO EARLIER than X months/years later. (Hash rate has no effect on how the bomb grows\u2013the fist part of the difficulty calc is designed specifically to eliminate fluctuations in hash rate\u2013and the bomb, once it appears dominates being exponential. All you need to predict the earliest time the bomb will appear is knowledge of where it started. A lowering of hash rate can\u2019t make it come earlier, and a rise in hash rate can only make it come later.) I suggest the bomb be delayed FORK_NUMBER - 200,000 (or earlier). ",

                    "content": "4 mil is too much +1 2 years delay is way too much. Context: The difficulty bomb has the purpose to add pressure in order to upgrade to Proof of Stake. This EIP is not aligned with that fundamental that ethereum subscribed for. Current situation: the difficulty bomb is being delayed for free*. For free* means that ethereum delays its promised improvements without any compensation or commitment. On the demand/supply analysis we can\u2019t see that there\u2019s not enough demand for Ether to play its scarcity game. A higher demand has to be created and this is done through improvements. If improvements have to be delayed, the difficulty bomb was programmed to tick and start reducing the supply of ether, the bomb works as expected, the development is not as expected, these are the facts. Problem: However, nothing is for free. A delay of the difficulty bomb without any compensation or commitment to the Ethereum network has its costs. Costs might not be visible at first sight, but sure they exist and ethereum has suffered this impact for the last 1,5 years. Proposal: To link the difficulty bomb delay to the development of Ethereum (eth 2.0 and/or eth 1.x). Instead of 2 years bomb delay for free, have bombs delays only after ethereum hits a development milestone. Example: Today, there\u2019s no need to delay the bomb by installing a client that applies EIP-2384. Instead, deliver Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 as expected within 2020 Q1. Or deliver Ethereum 1.x. Once delivered, then ethereum nodes cast their votes to delay the bomb in the network by installing a client that applies EIP-2384. Putting off everything breaks the entire game theory of these networks. ",

In fact, besides the potential of the finality gadget, eth1 isn\u2019t even aware of eth2 and doesn\u2019t need to fork for it. We should really stop combining these two ideas.

That\u2019s a good point. With regards to the Finality Gadget, I doubt we\u2019ll see it live on mainnet in <1 year (given that light clients for Eth2 need to be built and that work hasn\u2019t started as far as I\u2019m aware). This would come fairly close to the ~1.5 years in which the bomb would go off again. Aside from the bomb, though, miners will have an incentive to upgrade to what is considered the \u201cproper\u201d Ethereum by the community. If a large majority of Ethereum users & infrastructure providers consider the finality-gadget chain to be the correct one, then miners have an incentive to follow that chain given that it will be \u201cETH\u201d and have most/all activity/economic value tied to it.
