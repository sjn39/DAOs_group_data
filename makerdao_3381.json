                    "content": "Hi there. Some of you may be interested in an important development within one of the key DeFi legal / regulatory areas. FATF, an intergovernmental organization responsible for global AML coordination efforts, has just released a consultation paper related to the revision of their guidance on the \u201crisk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)\u201d: http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html It\u2019s all about crypto, and many topics of their interest (Dapps, p2p transactions, etc.) are in practice all about DeFi. This is important because FATF\u2019s recommendations are usually implemented into legal systems of all major jurisdictions. The final revised guidance (to be adopted as a result of this consultation) will shape at least some of the key aspects of the global AML framework for DeFi. Food for thought, especially for the future legal core unit. ",

                    "content": "    g_dip:  Is there a definition of what they consider a \u201cVASP\u201d?   Yes. It\u2019s available in the FATF Glossary: Virtual asset service provider means any natural or legal person who is not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations, and as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person: * i. exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies; * ii. exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets; * iii. transfer of virtual assets; * iv. safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets; and * v. participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer\u2019s offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.  Now, FATF does not propose to change this definition (adopted in 2019), but they want to amend the associated guidance instead. For example, this is what they see as a general rule (VA = virtual asset) : Despite the many and frequently changing marketing terms and innovative business models developed in this sector, the FATF envisions very few VA arrangements will form and operate without a VASP involved at some stage if countries apply the definition correctly. Also, that\u2019s what they write about exchange and transfer in the context of decentralized systems: 56. Exchange or transfer services may also occur through so-called decentralized exchanges or platforms. ... Dapp, for example, is a term that refers to a software program that operates on a P2P network of computers running a blockchain protocol ... Often, a DApp user must pay a fee to the DApp, which is commonly paid in VAs, for the ultimate benefit of the owner/operator/developer/community in order to develop/run/maintain the software. DApps can facilitate or conduct the exchange or transfer of VAs. 57. A DApp itself (i.e. the software program) is not a VASP under the FATF standards, as the Standards do not apply to underlying software or technology (see below). However, entities involved with the DApp may be VASPs under the FATF definition. For example, the owner/operator(s) of the DApp likely fall under the definition of a VASP, as they are conducting the exchange or transfer of VAs as a business on behalf of a customer. The owner/operator is likely to be a VASP, even if other parties play a role in the service or portions of the process are automated. Likewise, a person that conducts business development for a DApp may be a VASP when they engage as a business in facilitating or conducting the activities previously described on behalf of another natural or legal person. The decentralization of any individual element of operations does not eliminate VASP coverage if the elements of any part of the VASP definition remain in place. Remember, FATF provides a general framework and individual countries remain responsible for their own implementations. In some of them the new regulatory category of VASP was introduced in the past 2-3 years, in some others the conclusion is that the current regulatory regimes are sufficiently broad, in a few others the discussion is ongoing. However, whatever happens at the FATF level sets a general direction. What the community should consider is: (1) monitoring the developments, (2) (perhaps) participating in the discussions with policymakers, (3) actively taking the developments into account when creating and adjusting its strategy and setup.

Well, asking this type of questions was exactly my point and that\u2019s why at the very beginning I wrote this:     jacek:  What the community should consider is: (1) monitoring the developments, (2) (perhaps) participating in the discussions with policymakers, (3) actively taking the developments into account when creating and adjusting its strategy and setup.   Let\u2019s remember that end of day it\u2019s mostly about dealing with complex regulatory regimes, not just slogans (like e.g. \u201cDeFi without KYC is illegal\u201d). What\u2019s more, the primary task should be to make Maker resilient, not necessarily to solve all problems of the industry. Maker community will just need a strategy and resources (especially a highly qualified and dedicated workforce) for doing that. ",

Compliance and regulatory issues are increasingly important, engagement here is key. There is still a significant amount of fear about what stablecoins objective is and the wider DeFi space in general. I believe that preventing ML and TF is critical, however ironically the way to reduce trafficking is reduce the desperate need these people face at a fundamental level.  Being able to build some wealth is a critical first step.
