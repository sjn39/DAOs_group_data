After a couple of false starts, we are about 2/3rds of the way done in scoping the new Governor Contracts for the Gitcoin DAO and Treasury. These contracts are being developed by our friends and partners at ScopeLift. These folks have worked with Gitcoin for years and have helped us build a number of other products. They have also been championing flexible voting for DAOS and worked with Uniswap to introduce this concept. Okay, so the exciting news! We are about 2/3rds of the way done and we have a few questions we would love community feedback on. If you can answer the poll, it would be greatly appreciated, but we are essentially looking for feedback on if Flexible Voting should be implemented as part of this governor upgrade, or if we would like to \u201cplay it safe\u201d and avoid allowing the voting mechanism. From @bendi - \u201cFlexible Voting allows for the construction of new mechanisms which make governance participation easier, cheaper, and more accessible for GTC holders.\u201d You should really checkout the post linked above what flexible voting is, but to save a few clicks, here is a great graphic outlining the benefits of it. Essentially flexible voting enables Snapshot strategies. Those who have GTC staked in an LP can still use that GTC to vote for on-chain proposals.  flex-voting-diagram3840\u00d72160 496 KB  We are about to start testing the new contracts and will have more info to share on those soon, but we hope to have a vote live in January to upgrade the governor contracts from the Governor Alpha we have today, to an Open Zepplin Variant of Governor Bravo. I can share more of the contract details in a subsequent post soon (ie, if threshold amounts changes are proposed, quorum numbers, etc.) For now, give me your thoughts on flexible voting!     Yes - Flexible Voting is important to our Governance No - Flexible Voting doesn\u2019t seem necessary and we should skip it.     0 voters     ",

Has been a busy few weeks for us  You did a great job summing up what Flexible Voting is all about. We think being able to participate in both DeFi (with your GTC) and governance at the same time is a compelling use case and we recently received a grant from Aave Grants DAO to add Flexible Voting support to ATokens. We expect the work will be done early next year. One note I want to add: while depositing tokens in DeFi protocols is one of the use cases we imagine, there are a lot more, and some of them are just as exciting\u2014if not more so. A couple I\u2019m really excited about are Layer 2 voting (bridge your GTC to a rollup, vote from the rollup with low gas fees) and shielded voting (deposit your GTC to a pool and vote privately with ZKPs).     shawn16400:  Just catching up on this concept and it looks appealing. @bendi if you need help in scenario development or testing, let me know - I would be happy to help!   Sure let\u2019s chat. Will follow up!     krrisis:  An open tab that I missed here - I voted no here because we mainly use Tally for transferring funds, not so much for voting itself, so not sure it is needed.   Hey @krrisis, thanks for your thoughts! I\u2019m not quite sure what you mean here regarding Tally and transferring funds. Happy to expand if you have any specific questions. That said, we\u2019ve been in touch with the folks at Tally (they rock!) and they\u2019ve signaled their support for the FV mechanism, and even a willingness to support it in their tooling should a DAO request it!     DisruptionJoe:  Therefore, the upgrade to flexible voting would make it easier for us use tokens for governance while also using them for other productive use cases.   Yep! That\u2019s exactly right @DisruptionJoe     DisruptionJoe:  Expiration of delegations   This is an interesting idea! Since delegations happen inside the GTC contract, not the Governor contract, the only way to add this by default would be to migrate the community to a new version of GTC. That said, with Flexible Voting, you could design a delegate contract that sub-delegated to regular voters, and included configurable expiration by default. In other words, with Flexible Voting you could build an opt-in version of this.     DisruptionJoe:  Ability for someone to drop their delegations if they no longer want to participate   As it stands now anyone can revoke a delegation by re-assigning it at anytime, including to themselves or to no one. So I think this basically exists already. Unless I\u2019m misunderstanding what you mean? Anyway if anyone else has other questions about either the Governor upgrade or Flexible Voting, please hit me up! I\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for replies  ",

Ohh interesting I see what you mean now\u2014the steward removing other delegations. I\u2019m curious about the motivation for this feature. Like a ragequit kind of thing? Thinking about the implementation, similar to the idea of expiring delegates, I believe to implement this globally you\u2019d have to migrate the community to a new version of GTC. But I believe, off the top of my head without thinking about it too deeply, it could also be built as an opt-in feature with Flexible Voting. Great example of how this new primitive will allow the building of all kinds of new stuff by 3rd party devs, including things we haven\u2019t conceived of yet! Edit: Grammar ",

What new attack vectors do we open ourselves up to?   Flexible Voting is an extension of the battle tested OpenZeppelin Governor. The OZ Governor is audited and used by many DAOs. Our extension is minimal and can be be seen here. A good chunk of the code in that contract is itself borrowed from other OZ extensions. Overall the \u201cnew code\u201d is extremely minimal, which is by design! All that said, we are also pursuing an audit for the extension, with funding being the biggest blocker.     chaselb:  How much more context does this require of the average voter   The short answer is none. If a holder or voter is happy with the way things currently work, then no change would be required in their behavior. The FV system is fully backwards compatible with the existing Governor and so voting and delegating can continue as-is. Where a user might need to think a bit is if they choose to opt-in to something built with FV that enables a new experience. For example, we\u2019re currently finishing up AToken support for FV with a grant from Aave. This would theoretically allow depositing your GTC into Aave, but still voting with your share of the unborrowed Pool. Obviously, a new UX will have to be built for this, and obviously we\u2019ll want to keep that UX as clean and simple as possible. But all of that is purely on an opt-in basis.     chaselb:  does this allow me to give GTC to someone while keeping the voting power without their knowledge? As in, could I give my GTC to person A, but beforehand delegate the votes to contract B without person A\u2019s knowledge?   Nope! Delegation is done in the GTC Token contract, which would change, so the rules around delegation don\u2019t change either. When you transfer your GTC, your delegation (whether to an EOA or to a contract) is reset. Edit: clarity ",

We believe the adoption of FV will be a big unlock for the ecosystem, and in the spirit of Public Goods we\u2019re trying to make it happen with grant funding and community support! We\u2019ve had a number of parties express support for the extension, and should have some more announcements to share in this regard soon. Gitcoin has often been a leader in adopting new tech in the ecosystem. ScopeLift helped build the zkSync integration into Gitcoin Grants back when zkSync was the only rollup live in production, and had less than $100K in funds on the network. I think it\u2019s fair to say that decision by Gitcoin was an inflection point for Ethereum\u2019s L2 ecosystem. We hope the Gitcoin community will see this as an opportunity to once again be leaders the ecosystem. ",

After the talk, I had a great brainstorm with a few folks about even more cool stuff that can be built with Flexible Voting. People keep coming up with cool new things that could be built, including:  A chained delegation scheme where voting weight follows a chain of delegation until someone in the chain votes An incentivized voting scheme where anyone who fails to vote loses a small amount of their stake, which is given to those who did vote An opt-in doxxed voting pool (for sybil resistance) where votes are amplified quadratically with a pool of token weight delegated by the DAO or another whale  There was a lot of interest for Flexible Voting at ETHDenver from other DAOs as well. Our audit with OpenZeppelin starts this week, and I\u2019ll share updates on that as it progresses. There\u2019s a lot of momentum building for more modular governance! We\u2019re excited to get the proposal up for the Gitcoin community later this month! ",
