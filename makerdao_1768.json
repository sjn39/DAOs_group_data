                    "content": " Introduction A new iteration of the Maker auction system was introduced in May 2021. Since that time, $435 million worth of collateral has been successfully liquidated, collecting $46 million in penalty fees (the full 13% penalty fee with minor exceptions). Notably, in January 2021, the system was able to successfully liquidate $135 million of collateral in one day.  1094\u00d7111 25.7 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Liquidations These metrics demonstrate that Maker\u2019s current auction system is robust and that it is able to withstand large liquidation events. Nevertheless, although the current auction parameters are satisfactory, the @Risk-Core-Unit believes that there is still room for improvement. This is particularly the case due to the recent advancement of the Keeper ecosystem as well as the enhancement of general auction infrastructure. As a result, we believe that the auction throughput can be increased, which may in turn decrease the market risk of liquidatable collateral. In response to these changes and opportunities, this post introduces a new analysis and a set of proposed adjustments to Maker\u2019s auction parameters for 14 different collateral types. The post is structured as follows:  Auction Cycle Duration Auction Price Curve Slope Implication of Oracle Delay Auctioned Collateral Throughput Limits Keeper Incentives Dust Parameters Proposed Changes  A short TL;DR is provided at the beginning of each section.  Auction Cycle Duration TL;DR  Reduce the market risk of liquidatable collateral by lowering the buffer on the OSM price in order to shorten settlement duration from approximately 28 minutes to 19 minutes for main vault types A lower buf parameter value will lead to a shorter \u201creaction time\u201d for keepers During large liquidation events in particular, auction inefficiencies still exist. Steeper auction price decreases are likely not beneficial. Hence, no changes to the Auction Price Function are currently proposed.  As a general rule of thumb, auction throughput should be as high as possible. A higher auction throughput should in theory reduce the market risk of pending liquidations. To adjust auction throughput, two key elements are normally considered:   The Auction Price Multiplier (Parameter name buf): A multiplier that is applied to the starting price of a collateral auction. The buf parameter should be high enough to ensure that the starting price is above the one-hour lagged Oracle Security Module (OSM) price, in the event that the market price rebounds in the same period.  Auction Price Function (Parameter name calc): A mathematical function which determines how the collateral price falls over time (i.e. the auction price curve) during a collateral auction. The cut parameter controls the depth of each step in the function. The step parameter controls the length of time between price drops. A combination of these values determines the slope of the price curve. The slope should be steep enough to incentivise the settlement of an auction as quickly as possible.  When setting these parameters, certain limitations should be considered. These include:  The probability of a \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d type of network congestion happening. In such a scenario, keepers might not be able to bid instantly, even if arbitrage opportunities exist. Low competition among keepers increases the probability of bad auction settlement pricing.  As a result, the @Risk-Core-Unit has previously chosen a relatively conservative approach when determining the Auction Price Multiplier and the Auction Price Function. Currently, collateral auctions have a buf parameter of around 1.2 and a decreasing price curve rate that ensures keepers have approximately 28 minutes in \u201creaction time\u201d before an arbitrage opportunity presents itself. In addition, once arbitrage opportunities actually materialise, the auction price continues to drop conservatively (e.g. 1% drop every 90 seconds for ETH-A). This is due to the risk of unsustainably high settlement discounts, as a result of certain inefficiencies among keepers. This concept is explained in further detail below. Following a year of empirical measurements, the data indicates that the Maker Keeper Ecosystem has improved substantially. There are now on average 15 unique taker addresses settling auctions. In addition, the Sidestream Auction Services Core Unit has improved the accessibility of auction participation by developing a public UI where anyone can settle auctions using flashloaned DAI, and settle auctions directly via Uniswap v2, all in one transaction.  1398\u00d7913 51.9 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Keepers/Takers However, the data has also indicated that, despite increased keeper competition and better infrastructure in place, during large liquidation events, MakerDAO has still witnessed relatively high slippage rates, and hence high-profit rates for keepers. For example, during Flappy Friday in January 2021, the largest ETH-A liquidation ($57 million) experienced 12% slippage to market prices. Another WBTC-A liquidation ($12 million) experienced 16% slippage. This means that keepers were not willing to settle auctions until discounts were relatively high. For example, during the same day, there was an arbitrage opportunity for at least 15 minutes to make 2%+ on a trade. Keepers were not willing to participate in the auction until the discount increased well over 10%.  1328\u00d7615 135 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Liquidations Per Date  1345\u00d7608 57.1 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Liquidations Per Date The analysis indicates that a more aggressive/steeper pricing curve is likely not beneficial. In fact, a case can be made that an even flatter slope may help with auction inefficiencies. However, a flatter pricing curve would increase market risk, which is already relatively high considering the one-hour OSM delay (this concept is explained in further detail below). Lowering the buf parameter, on the other hand, may be beneficial. Lowering buf while keeping the Auction Price Function constant, would result in shorter reaction times for keepers. At the same time, this would allow keepers more time to settle larger liquidation lot sizes, where inefficiencies remain. This way, market risk would decrease as a result of the increase of liquidation throughput, while not risking an increase in the inefficiencies that can occur during \u201cFlappy Friday\u201d type liquidation events.  Auction Price Curve Slope A central objective for a balanced and well-functioning auction system is to create a Auction Price Curve that yields fair auction dynamics for both the Maker Protocol and its keepers. Hence, the right assumptions underlying the choice of the buf, cut, and step parameters are essential. During times of high volatility (i.e. market crashes), the behaviour of ETH prices provides important data that helps inform those assumptions. TL;DR:  During Black Thursday, the major sell-off triggered a series of cascading events that resulted in the price violently changing in a short period of time. The cascading ETH price action shows four clear time intervals where the price of ETH fluctuated in distinct patterns, as characterised by the Garman-Klass volatility. From 2021 to date, data from larger auction events, confirms that notable arbitrage opportunities arise after large market crashes and that keepers use such opportunities to profit on auction settlement. To test the resiliency of the Auction Price Curve during these events, we used the drift and volatility of the StairStep Exponential function to simulate the price action of ETH. Our simulations suggest that the StairStep Exponential function reasonably captures the aftermath of a market crash, and in fact, tends to be more aggressive than what we have seen historically.  In the current auction system, a price curve function can either be linear or exponential. Previous analyses by the @Risk-Core-Unit have identified an exponential price decrease as the preferred function. There are a couple of reasons for this:  Since the starting auction price is intended to be above the latest OSM price, we may want the auction price decrease to be more aggressive at the beginning of an auction duration. An overly aggressive price decrease at a later stage in the auction duration may be harmful, since an unsustainably low price may lead to the undercollateralization of liquidated vaults.  Further information is available in the forum post, LINK-A Liquidations 2.0 Parameters. The slope of the exponential price curve is determined by two parameters: cut and step. These parameters determines the time interval until the next price drop occurrence, as well as the magnitude of the price drop. Another interesting parameter defining the curve function is buf, which defines the starting auction price. In this way there is a buffer applied to the last OSM price in case the market price rebounds between the time OSM took the last market price and until the auction is kicked. The screenshot below illustrates the current auction throughput for ETH-A. The relevant auction parameters are set to the following values:   buf = 1.20  cut = 99  step = 90   1322\u00d7872 60.7 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Auctions Throughput In order to make sure that keepers have enough time to react before an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, auctions currently have a high buf parameter, and a relatively flat decreasing slope.  Historical Analysis This section includes an analysis of minute-by-minute data from seven distinct scenarios, where the ETH price dropped by an extraordinary amount, and where several vaults were liquidated. The table below lists each individual event and corresponding date in chronological order.     Date Max Price Drop     20200312 48.11%   20210519 44.57%   20210523 27.03%   20210921 14.27%   20211214 5.00%   20220121 18.29%   20220122 11.88%    The day with the largest Maximum Price Drop (48.11%) was March 12, 2020. This date later become referred to as Black Thursday. The considerable ETH price decrease on Black Thursday led to sizable forced liquidations in the Maker Protocol. The analysis below first focuses on the events of Black Thursday. It then covers the remaining days listed in the table above.  Black Thursday - 2020.03.12 The image below divides Black Thursday into four different time intervals. Each interval represents a period of time where the price of ETH behaved differently and diverged from the previous interval.  928\u00d7640 84.3 KB  In the first interval, there was a continuous approximate ~18% price drop with no discernible volatility. In the second interval, the price fell significantly. In hindsight, such a pattern clearly indicates a Black Swan Event, or in other words, an event that leads to a sudden and unexpected price drop. The third interval can be seen as a market rebound period with a low to medium level of volatility. Finally, the fourth interval is characterised by a sudden and aggressive fall in price with medium to high volatility. The volatility intervals throughout the whole period can be observed by looking at the Garman-Klass\u2019 volatility chart below.  704\u00d7190 12.2 KB  The chart above provides useful volatility insights. Notably, it shows considerable differences in ETH price action from around 10:00 to 13:00 (see figure below).  702\u00d7192 17 KB  By looking at the GK volatility, we can distinguish multiple peaks of volatility, that can be seen as different speeds of price decay, but is nothing but the spread of the Open, High, Low and Close prices. From the observations on Black Thursday we may conclude that, in a risk-off environment, a considerable sell-off will trigger a series of cascading events that result in the price violently changing through two or more intervals in a short period of time. Nevertheless, it is also important to note that Black Thursday was an unexpected event which happened in tandem with a global sell-off across markets.  Other liquidations events Black Thursday is one of many fat-tail events observed in crypto. It is important to keep in mind that fat-tail events can behave in different ways and are influenced by the prevalent market conditions at the point in time for which they unfold. It is therefore important to analyze additional historical price data and understand the behaviour of the price during each individual relevant event. The charts below illustrate the historical price behaviour of six other significant events. The respective dates are: 2021.05.19, 2021.05.23, 2021.09.21, 2021.12.14, 2022.01.21, and 2022.01.22.  1225\u00d7644 254 KB  The price action of ETH (charts above) for each respective occasion indicate significant price drops. However, there are no clear indications of rapid price drops, coupled with high volatility, in the same magnitude as compared to the events that unfolded during Black Thursday. This observation is further confirmed by the GK Volatility charts shown below:  1068\u00d7564 65 KB  Comparing the events illustrated in the GK Volatility charts above, only one date is comparable to Black Thursday in magnitude (~1e-3) and behaviour, namely May 19, 2021. To further understand the events of May 19, 2021, the two charts below are used to examine the ETH price movement and the GK Volatility during the time period between 12:30 and 14:30.  908\u00d7565 50.5 KB  There were two distinct volatility events on this date. One around 13:00, and the second at 13:45. However, only the first event resulted in a significant price drop (~20%). The second peak on the GK volatility chart highlights the fact that for a certain period of time the bid/offer spread was relatively wide, and several people could have made a profit. For Maker, the fact that these events unfolded in less than one hour, suggests that much shorter auction cycles can likely be established. The data indicates that during market crashes, arbitrage opportunities may arise, and keepers may in turn take advantage of increased profits on auction settlements. The observations from the historical analysis are summarized in the table below.  In summary, there are two common denominators that characterise these events: (i) abrupt minute and hourly price changes and (ii) high volatility, both in terms of standard deviation and GK volatility. In addition, in extreme events, prices can drop faster than expected, which in turn, can lead to undercollateralization events in the Maker Protocol. It is worth noting that two or more spikes in GK volatility for ETH prices do not necessarily result in a sudden price drop. It can, however, indicate more severe market conditions, and the emergence of arbitrage opportunities.  Auctions Price Curve Functional Form The next step of the analysis investigates the Auction Price Curve Functional Form. The objective is to determine if the current auction price curve is able to capture sudden ETH price drops within a certain auction duration. For this, we created an agnostic model to simulate the aftermath of a liquidation event.  Methodology Suppose that suddenly, the ETH price drops sharply and several Vaults need to be liquidated. Following this, auctions are kicked at a given OSM price, and, by means of the Stair-Step Exponential Decrease, it is assumed that the price decreases monotonically. The slope of the continuously decreasing curve is determined from values of buf, cut, and step. To determine if the Stair-Step Exponential function captures real market price movements, a new time series, influenced by the shape of the curve, needs to be created. We reverse-engineered this price action using Geometric Brownian Motion simulations, where the percentage drift and the percentage volatility of the process are determined by the distribution of the Stair-Step Exponential function. In addition, to account for fat-tail risks, we used Laplace\u2019s probability distribution function to generate the random steps of the simulation. In detail, we created 1k GBM paths, for each simulation we generate 8400 seconds (random steps); where the initial price is set at OSM + buf. Then for each of the random paths, we aggregated them into minute by minute Open, High, Low and Close data, as shown in the image below:  Using the OHLC data generated, we then proceeded to calculate Garman-Klass\u2019 volatility to get a sense of the volatility of the process. For one path, results are shown in the image below:  In summary, for every path simulated, we modeled a distinct time series characterized by its own GK volatility. The stochastic process behind each of these simulations is determined by the mean and standard deviation of the Auction Price Curve which is a Stair-Step Exponential function.  Results Since every path has a different volatility profile, we normalized GK Volatility output to make them comparable, as shown in the image below:  1068\u00d7318 121 KB  In our simulations, we did not make any assumptions of the particular path of each random process, and we did not apply large volatility multipliers to model interim (while the auction is running) market crashes. In this way, we accounted for model bias to attempt to accurately simulate market prices as a stochastic process following the drift and volatility of the Stair-Step Exponential function. The following table shows the results of our model. The metrics extracted from our simulations show a qualitative match with data from Black Swan Events. This match suggests that our methodology can help model the rapid price decay shown in fat-tail events.  778\u00d7304 18.6 KB  Since each high volatility event is different, the best metric to compare our model with the aftermath of a liquidation event is through the coefficient of variation, which is the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of the sample. The following tables show, side by side, a comparison between the following 140 minutes after the crash in the dates we analysed, and the results of our simulation:  1288\u00d7466 21.9 KB  Since the coefficient of variation is a dimensionless unit, it can be used to compare data sets that have different sample averages. Note that our simulations suggest that the overall behaviour of the StairStep Exponential function reasonably captures the aftermath of a market crash, and in some instances, a bit more aggressive than previously observed.  Implications of Oracle Delay TL;DR:  The slope of the auction price curve has limited impact on auction efficiency since the majority of the market risk comes from the one-hour OSM price delay We recommend that governance compare and contrast the trade-offs of longer versus shorter OSM delays and its impacts on auction efficiency  The Oracle Security Module (OSM) one-hour delay is a clear benefit for vault users. They are able to unwind their positions before getting liquidated, with a one-hour time limit. However, the OSM one-hour delay has certain implications for the Maker auction system. To limit the market risk that arises from the one-hour delay, shorter auction cycles and fast liquidations are preferred. However, as explained in the \u201cAuction Cycle Duration\u201d section, such decisions have certain implications. Fast auction settlement makes sense only if you are confident about the keeper ecosystem. For example, an adequate number of keeper participants, a stable and robust infrastructure setup, and no potential network congestion. Hence, assuming that keepers are fully prepared and willing to settle auctions instantly, even at relatively small percentage profits, it is interesting to understand what the actual slippage of auctions would be using the market price versus using the OSM price. In an attempt to answer this question, we ran simulations with different combinations of buf and step parameters on the five most volatile days in the past 15 months. We looked at median slippages of liquidated vaults. Essentially, we wanted to simulate auction slippage results, based on having much shorter auction cycles, to see how much slippages would improve as a result of the reduction in market risk. Another key assumption behind the simulation was that keepers will work flawlessly, and take on average 5% taker profit. Interestingly, the results indicate that the improvement in slippage is only minor. The reason for this is the following: the one-hour OSM delay already accounts for the majority of market risk and it is not material whether the auctions subsequently settle after 30 minutes or 5 minutes. For example, on May 19, 2021, one set of liquidations happened at the lagged OSM price of $2,710 while the market price at that time was already $2,120, implying 20% slippage mainly due to the OSM delay.  1600\u00d71017 193 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Auction Kick Simulation Looking at the simulation below, you can see that on May 19, 2021, if the auction parameters had been set to a more aggressive price curve, the average settlement duration of all liquidations on that day would have taken only 18 minutes instead of 58 minutes.  1600\u00d7634 189 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Auction Kick Simulation As illustrated below, the improvement in slippage would be only 0.7%, while facing all the risks of shorter auction cycles discussed above.  1600\u00d7740 205 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Auction Kick Simulation The conclusion of these simulations, which all yielded similar results, is that the optimization of the auction price curve does not materially contribute to a lower market risk of pending liquidations. This is due to the fact that the one-hour OSM delay accounts for the majority of the market risk. As seen below, the OSM implied slippage is most of the time the majority of the highest slippage simulated.  1600\u00d7886 167 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Auction Kick Simulation This also confirms our conservative thinking that we should not set a too aggressive price curve. Even though it may have certain benefits, it would also imply that Maker would be too reliant on keepers\u2019 infrastructure running smoothly.  Auctioned Collateral Throughput Limits TL;DR  As a result of shortening auction cycles, we propose that both the value of the ilk.hole (Local Liquidation Limit) and hole (Global Liquidation Limit) parameters should be lowered. Both Maker\u2019s debt size and collateral amount has decreased. Hence, it is prudent to lower the limits of available collateral being auctioned at any one time.  If Maker is to introduce a shorter auction cycle duration time, the amount of liquidatable over time will increase. Worsening DEX liquidity and a decrease in DAI debt from volatile collateral in the Maker Protocol, suggests that lowering the value of the ilk.hole parameter (i.e. the Local Liquidation Limit) may be prudent. The ilk.hole parameter can be described as the maximum amount of DAI debt for which collateral auctions can be active at any one time within a particular vault type. The heuristics that the @Risk-Core-Unit utilize to determine and set the ilk.hole parameter have been described in the past: we believe that the amount of liquidatable collateral should not lead to more than -5% slippage on-chain. The chart below indicates that liquidity on AMMs for ETH has decreased in the last few months. For example, liquidating $100 million worth of ETH now leads to circa -7.75% slippage. In comparison, just a few months ago, this figure was -4% to -6%. At the beginning of 2022, the slippage was even lower.  1006\u00d7580 152 KB  Source: Block Analitica Maker Risk Dashboard - Assets / ETH It is also worth noting that there exists another, tangential, parameter: the \u201cGlobal Liquidation Limit\u201d, with the parameter name hole. The hole parameter controls the maximum amount of DAI debt for which collateral auctions can be active at any one time, throughout the whole Maker Protocol system. The hole parameter is currently set to 100 million. This limit has more to do with how much DAI can be sourced in auctions at once, and is arguably less important than the Local Liquidation Limit, due to flashloan settlement and the fact that PSMs exist. However, limiting the number of vault types that can be liquidated at any one time is still preferable and useful. Instead of allowing the sum of ilk.hole to be a limiting factor, it is important to set the global limit of the amount of liquidatable debt. Since shorter auction cycles have been proposed, we also believe it is prudent to decrease the hole parameter value by an equal measure, from 100 million DAI, to 70 million DAI.  Keeper Incentives TL;DR  In light of a decrease in gas fees, we propose a slightly lower tip of 250 DAI (Flat Kick Incentive)  Liquidations 2.0 introduced two new parameters to further incentivize liquidations of undercollateralized vaults: tip (Flat Kick Incentive) and chip (Proportional Kick Incentive). Both parameters are voted on and set by Maker governance. Auctions incentives are defined by a combination of these factors, as follows: incentives = chip * debt + tip In summary, the chip parameter determines the share of debt to award to a keeper that triggers a collateral liquidation auction. The tip parameter sets an additional flat fee designed to further incentivize the keeper to trigger auctions. In January, 2022, the StableSims Project provided an illuminating analysis of keeper\u2019s economic incentives. They aimed to minimize the amount paid in incentives to the keepers and, at the same time, maximize the speed at which undercollateralized vaults were liquidated. In the section that follows, we review the assumptions made by this seminal work. Based on an analysis of past liquidations, we propose new values for chip and tip. We also address the Incentive Farming Risk mentioned in the Maker Protocol Technical Documentation.  Analysis For our initial analysis we focused on ETH-A collateral and the date May 29, 2022. We investigated the available debt and incentives, and we simulated for different values of chip and tip. Furthermore, we focused on \u201ckick events\u201d (i.e. available debt when an auction is started). In the figure below, we see the two characteristic features of chip and tip. On the one hand, for varying values of tip, the theoretical incentives increases substantially when the amount of available collateral increases. On the other hand, for chip = 0.001 and varying tip, the additive nature of this parameter translates up and down the base incentive for the keeper.  852\u00d7564 70 KB  There exists a trade-off between these values. However, at a minimum, the tip incentive should cover the gas price paid by the keeper. On May 29, 2022, a comparison of incentives, with median gas prices, shows that these may not be great enough to cover gas costs.  852\u00d7240 30.1 KB  Furthermore, other vaults from the same date (May 29, 2022), show similar results where gas costs were not covered by the tip incentive.  However, note that this was a very bearish day, and a large amount of liquidations happen throughout the ecosystem, which would result in higher gas costs. To have a better understanding of how incentives compare with gas costs in different market environments, a deeper dive into historical liquidation data is needed.  Incentives Over Time Historical liquidation data is analysed in the following section. The analysis focuses on the period between May 2021 and July 2022. In addition, gas price and liquidations are inherently unpredictable. Hence, outliers were removed to make meaningful comparisons over time.  Methodology Incentives: The collateral of some vaults is far larger than others. Hence, we considered these as outliers and were filtered (99% quantile). The skewness of the distribution was accounted for by using the daily median value of incentives.  Gas Price: As gas prices are volatile, we took the median gas price of each day, filtering outliers above the 99% quantile.  It is important to note that on days when the number of samples is small (less than 10 kick events) the median value tends to be a less accurate measurement. For such days, we took the geometric mean of the daily incentives, since it tends to be a better measure of the \u201cmiddle\u201d. Applying the methodology to ilks ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, and wBTC-A, and looking at the days where at least one liquidation event happened, the following results were generated:  1068\u00d7636 98 KB  For most days where liquidations occurred, incentives covered the gas price. In fact, the results of the analysis indicate that, on most days, base incentives could have been lower than the current value of 300 DAI. Furthermore, the results indicates a clear trade-off between the chip and tip parameters. The most cost-effective way to incentivize kicks is through the tip parameter. Consequently, since gas prices are mostly covered, we recommend a combination of 0.001 chip and 250 tip. The analysis shows that the chip parameter, which is a function of the debt liquidated, is not as effective as the tip. Finally, our recommendation allows for us to have a more optimized set of incentive parameters for keepers and for the protocol it will mean a remunerative way to incentivize auctions to be taken. In addition, a lower tip would also decrease incentive farming attacks, described at length on the Maker Protocol Technical Documentation.  Dust Parameter TL;DR:  Dust protects the protocol and users from tail risk events where the position would result in bad debt accrual and users potentially losing the whole collateral amount. Dust presents an opportunity cost of not addressing the retail market segment, which we believe is currently not significant in terms of capital amount. Currently, we do not recommend any changes to dust levels.  The dust parameter sets the minimum permitted debt amount that a vault type can issue. The dust parameter prevents the creation of unsustainably small vaults that risk being unprofitable to unwind and/or liquidate under conditions of high gas prices and/or volatile asset prices. The dust parameter protects the Maker Protocol from bad debt and the vault users from certain losses in specific market instances. Dust is therefore a form of tail risk event management. The negative aspect of dust is that it makes it more difficult for users with lower capital amounts to use the protocol, resulting in potential lost revenue and DAI issued. During a period of low gas prices, it might seem like a good opportunity to lower dust and attract more users. However, it should also be considered that increasing the dust parameter is much more destructive to existing vault holders than decreasing it. Increasing the dust parameters would result in existing vault users not being able to repay their debt in chunks (debt can not be lowered below the dust limit). While there are technical workarounds, for example by using flash loans, the non-technical vault holders would likely need external capital to repay the debt and withdraw their collateral. This, in turn, would result in an unpleasant and capital intensive user experience. On the other hand, the number of retail users below the current dust limits is not that large in comparison with larger users. Due to the aforementioned reasons, the dust parameters should preferably be increased over time, except in specific situations where the underlying technology is more advanced, to the level where high gas prices are very unlikely to occur again. In addition to the dust parameter limit under normal circumstances, there is a possibility of a censorship spamming attack. Any public blockchain with a fee market can suffer a censorship spamming attack, where an attacker will post transactions with high gas prices and prevent users that are not prepared to pay as high of a price during the time of the attack. Higher dust values increase the difficulty and cost of performing such a censorship attack. The exact figure for dust is to some extent subjective, as in theory, gas price is unlimited. We have developed a methodology which helps determine the figure in a more objective manner from the perspective of the protocol, to make sure liquidations will go through. The methodology takes into consideration: (i) the average consumption of gas required to perform a successful liquidation, (ii) current incentives to liquidators (tip and chip), (iii) the vaut type liquidation ratio, (iv) the liquidation penalty, and (v) the realized auction price compared to vault\u2019s liquidation price (the last factor incorporates price slippage, price change during one-hour OSM delay and liquidators profit). A simulator, based on currently defined parameters in MCD, and that allows the adjustment of gas prices against the ether price can be found here.  Proposed Changes Below are the proposed changes for each collateral type that has liquidation enabled. The only crypto collateral having liquidations enabled, where we are not proposing any changes, is UNIV2ETHUSDC-A, which is potentially getting offboarded due to lack of demand and higher oracle costs.  Auction Cycle Related Changes   buf parameter (starting auction price multiplier)  ETH-A from 1.2 to 1.1 ETH-C from 1.2 to 1.1 WBTC-A from 1.2 to 1.1 WBTC-C from 1.2 to 1.1 wstETH-A from 1.2 to 1.1 wstETH-B from 1.2 to 1.1 ETH-B from 1.2 to 1.1 WBTC-B from 1.2 to 1.1 LINK-A from 1.3 to 1.2 MATIC-A from 1.3 to 1.2 MANA-A from 1.3 to 1.2 renBTC-A from 1.3 to 1.2 crvv1ETHwstETH-A from 1.3 to 1.2 The effect of these changes is a shorter average settlement duration:  from about 28 minutes to 15 minutes for (st)ETH and WBTC high to mid liquidation ratio vault types from about 19 minutes to 10 minutes for ETH and WBTC low liquidation ratio vaults From about 40 minutes to 27 minutes for \u201ctier two\u201d vaults (higher volatility and lower liquidity collateral)  As an example, note how changes affect the ETH-A price curve: Old auction price curve New auction price curve  982\u00d7513 60.9 KB  985\u00d7520 62.9 KB   Auction Duration & Reset Related Changes   cusp parameter (max auction price drawdown before reset)  ETH-A from 0.4 to 0.45 ETH-C from 0.4 to 0.45 WBTC-A from 0.4 to 0.45 WBTC-C from 0.4 to 0.45 wstETH-A from 0.4 to 0.45 wstETH-B from 0.4 to 0.45 ETH-B from 0.4 to 0.45 WBTC-B from 0.4 to 0.45 The intention of these changes is to keep a similar price drawdown reset threshold as it is now: at about 0.5 of OSM price.   tail parameter (max auction duration before reset)  ETH-A from 8,400 seconds to 7,200 seconds ETH-C from 8,400 seconds to 7,200 seconds WBTC-A from 8,400 seconds to 7,200 seconds WBTC-C from 5,400 seconds to 7,200 seconds wstETH-A from 8,400 seconds to 7,200 seconds wstETH-B from 8,400 seconds to 7,200 seconds ETH-B from 5,400 seconds to 4,800 seconds WBTC-B from 5,400 seconds to 4,800 seconds The intention of these changes is to satisfy the condition of keeping maximum duration until the auction price reaches about 50% of OSM.  Auction Throughput Limit Changes Auction throughput limit is enabled by a parameter called ilk.hole which defines the maximum amount of debt per ilk.type that can be liquidated at once. A lower ilk.hole for the particular vault types is proposed for two main reasons:  The debt amount per ilk type decreased over the last years On-chain liquidity in dollar value decreased.  Note that because we are proposing faster auction cycles, about 50% more collateral should get settled per unit of time.     Ilk Current ilk.hole New ilk.hole     ETH-A 65,000,000 40,000,000   WBTC-A 40,000,000 30,000,000   ETH-C 35,000,000 35,000,000   ETH-B 30,000,000 15,000,000   WBTC-B 25,000,000 10,000,000   WBTC-C 25,000,000 20,000,000   WSTETH-A 15,000,000 15,000,000   WSTETH-B 10,000,000 10,000,000   LINK-A 6,000,000 3,000,000   YFI-A 5,000,000 1,000,000   RENBTC-A 3,000,000 2,000,000   MATIC-A 3,000,000 3,000,000   crvv1ETHstETH-A 3,000,000 3,000,000   MANA-A 1,000,000 1,000,000    Adjustment is also proposed for aggregate hole parameters currently set at 100m DAI. We are proposing to decrease it to 70m, which corresponds to a general increase in auction throughput due to shorter auction cycles.  Keeper Incentive Changes We propose a marginal adjustment to keeper incentives, explained in detail in the \u201cKeeper Incentives\u201d section. We propose that the flat fee determined by the tip parameter should be dropped from 300 DAI to 250 DAI.     Ilk Current Tip (DAI) New Tip (DAI)     ETH-A 300 250   WBTC-A 300 250   ETH-C 300 250   ETH-B 300 250   WBTC-B 300 250   WBTC-C 300 250   WSTETH-A 300 250   WSTETH-B 300 250   LINK-A 300 250   YFI-A 300 250   RENBTC-A 300 250   MATIC-A 300 250   crvv1ETHstETH-A 300 250   MANA-A 300 250     Further Work If and when these parameter changes are implemented, we will make sure to monitor and analyze the efficiency of the subsequent auctions. In summary, we expect faster auctions and positive effects on slippage, since the market risk of pending auctions or potential auctions queued gets reduced. This means that the protocol should be better hedged against potential losses and that vault owners would be able to have larger amounts of collateral returned after being liquidated. This post has also offered us interesting observations about the Oracle Security Module (OSM) delay, and its effects on lower auction efficiency. It is recommended that the community should consider how much the one-hour oracle delay enhances Maker oracle robustness and the ability for vault owners to protect themselves versus having a less efficient auction process. Finally, we are analyzing different auction/liquidation designs across DeFi to further suggest improvements to the current Liq 2.0 implementation. ",

I thought of this September Forum post when I came across this BIS working paper about the \u201cfragility in decentralized markets.\u201d Specifically to how third-party liquidators (keepers) affect protocol risk, and how liquidations + deleveraging leads to lower asset prices. It mostly focuses on AAVE & Compound liquidations and it does not include MakerDAO\u2013although is does have some DAI liquidation data from AAVE/Comp. More than likely because of the complexity of analyzing Maker\u2019s liquidation parameters, the OSM one-hour delay, keeper incentives, etc.\u2013although we can all agree that there\u2019s room for improvement, as the people who oppose DeFi will look to smear the ecosystem. Lots of work ahead in order to prove them wrong. Anyhow, interesting read, and a reminder to the Maker community that there\u2019s lots of room for improvements in order to prove the non-believers wrong.
