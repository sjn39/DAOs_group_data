The mechanism that I came up with can also be applied in the conventional financial system to generate new money. It operates by regulating the supply of money so that an interest rate determined by a public market remains fixed. I wrote a paper about the mechanism (link below), and now I am trying to understand whether or not it is possible to implement it within the framework of the Maker system, and whether or not there are other cryptocurrencies where it would be easier to implement. I would appreciate any detailed feedback about this, thanks!! Elastic Cash ",
