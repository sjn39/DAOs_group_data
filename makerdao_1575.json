                    "content": " MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application Form This proposal for collateral onboarding is intended to help diversify Maker\u2019s risk from centralized stablecoins across issuers. While all centralized USD stablecoins face similar pressures with respect to regulation, spreading exposure to multiple issuers could reduce risk from possible \u201cover-compliance\u201d.  Background Information 1. Who is the interested party for this collateral application? @monet-supply 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project, with a focus on the applying collateral token. Uniswap v3 is a decentralized exchange allowing for concentrated liquidity within user selected price ranges. This allows for better capital efficiency vs traditional constant product market makers, but complicates UX for liquidity providers (positions are non fungible by default and fees must be claimed manually). Gelato (now Arrakis Finance) is a decentralized liquidity manager protocol for Uniswap v3 LPs, allowing for fungible LP tokens and automatic reinvestment using the Gelato keeper network. The GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI LP token represents the Gelato strategy for Uniswap v3 BUSD-DAI 0.01% fee pool, in the range of roughly 0.998 to 1.002 BUSD per DAI. This provides highly concentrated liquidity for the DAI-BUSD trading pair which could significantly improve trade execution for BUSD users in defi while helping to drive volume through other DAI trading pairs on DEX. 3. How long has the project been live in production? Uniswap v3 has been live since March 2021. Gelato / Arrakis has been live since July 2021. BUSD has been live since September 2019. 4. Provide a brief history of the project. Uniswap was founded in 2018 and has grown to become the largest decentralized exchange. The v3 version of the protocol added concentrated liquidity in March 2021, with Gelato / Arrakis automation deployed to help LPs manage their positions beginning in July 2021. Both Arrakis and Uniswap TVL have been significantly boosted by Maker\u2019s existing GUNI vault integrations (on the DAI-USDC 0.05% and 0.01% fee pools), comprising over $1.5 billion in assets currently. BUSD was launched in 2019 and has seen significant growth in circulating supply in recent years, as it is the most widely used stablecoin on the Binance centralized exchange and Binance Smart Chain defi ecosystem. 5. Link the whitepaper, documentation portals, and source code for the systems that interact with the proposed collateral, and all relevant Ethereum addresses. If the system is complex, schematics are especially appreciated.

What type of asset is it? (eg. store of value, currency, commodity, capital asset, governance token, etc) The GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI LP token is a stablecoin liquidity provider token, and can be treated as a yield bearing, cash equivalent asset. It is similar to existing Maker collateral types including GUNIV3-DAI-USDC (1 and 2) and UNIV2-DAI-USDC. 7. How is the asset used and does it give any rights to holders? (eg. financial claims, dividends, governance rights) The GUNI LP token gives holders the right to redeem a proportional share of underlying assets held within the BUSD-DAI liquidity pool on Uniswap v3. BUSD represents the right to redeem for underlying USD reserves (KYC is required for redemption from Paxos). 8. What is the market cap for the asset? GUNI LP tokens are mintable based on deposits of constituent assets to the liquidity pool. Currently the GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI token has only $500 TVL, but BUSD market cap is over $17 billion at time of writing and access to vault capabilities may increase usage significantly. 9. Where does exchange for the asset occur? BUSD is minted and redeemed through Paxos, and is widely traded across Binance exchange and certain other centralized trading platforms. BUSD has relatively lower usage within the Ethereum defi ecosystem. GUNI LPs can be minted or redeemed for underlying stablecoin assets via the contract. 9.a Provide exchange data on market liquidity, volume, and order book depth. BUSD has very high liquidity in centralized trading venues (particularly Binance) and on Binance Smart Chain, although liquidity is somewhat weaker on Ethereum. It is the third largest stablecoin by market and trading volume, behind USDT and USDC and just ahead of DAI. 10. Is the asset settled on chain (trustless) or off chain (trusted)? GUNI is minted/redeemed trustlessly through the contract. BUSD is freely transferable on chain, but can only be minted/redeemed via centralized accounts and is subject to possible token blacklisting. 11. If offchain (trusted) settlement: describe what are the involved entities, process, and estimated time. BUSD is issued and managed by Paxos. Creation / redemption of BUSD is subject to standard bank processing times (ACH or wire transfers etc). Tokens can be frozen by the issuer at any time. 12. List any possible oracle data sources for the proposed collateral type. Given that BUSD is mintable/redeemable for USD and reserves are managed via reputable custodian Paxos, it is suggested to mark BUSD value at fixed 1:1 parity with USD. The GUNI LP token can be valued similarly to existing GUNI vault type oracles. 13. List any parties interested in taking part in liquidations for the proposed collateral type. Similar to other stablecoin LP vaults, liquidations could be disabled by default. No specific parties are proposed as liquidators, but prior experience with TUSD offboarding shows that general keepers are capable of liquidating stablecoin assets.  Business Questions 14. What are the expected use cases of the DAI generated by the vault? This vault type is expected to be used for leveraged liquidity provision on the BUSD-DAI Uniswap v3 pair. Borrowed funds allow vault users to increase their exposure to underlying swap fees paid by Uniswap traders. For Maker, this helps deploy stablecoin balances into safe, revenue generating positions while reducing liquidity risk from potential freeze actions by stablecoin issuers. 15 What is the amount of DAI expected to be generated against the collateral and what is the timeline? Is there a commitment on a minimum amount of DAI to be generated? Amount of DAI generated is limited based on trade volumes on the underlying BUSD-DAI pair, and stability fees assessed by MakerDAO. Assuming 0% stability fees, 50x permitted leverage (102% liquidation ratio), and 10% expected rate of return, each $1 million in daily volume would support roughly $18 million in TVL / DAI minted. Recent averages show around $10 million in BUSD trading per week, which could yield roughly $25 million TVL. Each 0.01% stability fee increase reduces fully leveraged vault return by 0.5%, which could be expected to reduce total minting somewhat due to lower realized LP returns. Lower user expected returns, lower stability fees, lower liquidation ratio parameters (higher maximum leverage), or higher daily trading volume would result in relatively higher expected usage of the vault. 16. What are the strategic benefits for MakerDAO in onboarding the collateral? This vault type could help diversify Maker\u2019s counterparty exposure across centralized stablecoin issuers. This pool could also become the largest source of BUSD liquidity on Ethereum, giving DAI an important role in bridging liquidity between Ethereum and Binance.  Legal Questions 17. What are the legal risks associated with the tokens? BUSD is subject to similar legal / regulatory risks as other centralized stablecoins like GUSD, USDP, and USDC. BUSD tokens can be frozen by the issuer (eg. if subject to court order). 18. (Optional) Does one organization bear legal responsibility for the collateral? What jurisdiction does that organization reside in? BUSD is issued by Paxos, based in New York state. GUNI LP tokens are issued permissionlessly through the contract. 19. (Optional) Has your project obtained any legal opinions or memoranda regarding the regulatory standing of the token or an explanation of the same from the perspective of any jurisdiction? If so, those materials should be provided for community review. Not aware of any available documents on legal opinions for the token. 20. (Optional) Describe whether there are any regulatory registrations for the token and provide related documentation (including an explanation of any past or existing interactions with any regulatory authorities, regardless of jurisdiction), if applicable. Details on Paxos (BUSD issuer) regulatory oversight can be found here: Is Paxos regulated? What does that mean? - Paxos 21. Is issuance of the asset decentralized (trustless) or centralized (trusted)? BUSD has centralized issuance and redemption via Paxos. GUNI LP tokens can be minted or redeemed in a decentralized fashion directly with the contract. 21.a If centralized/trusted: by which legal entity, type of entity, and jurisdiction? Paxos is the issuer and custodian for BUSD. Paxos is a New York State trust company regulated by the NYDFS.  Technical Questions 22. Link any available audits of the project. Both procedural and smart contract focused audits. GUNI audits are available via github: g-uni-v1-core/audit at master \u00b7 gelatodigital/g-uni-v1-core \u00b7 GitHub BUSD attestations are available on Paxos site: Attestations - Paxos BUSD contract audit reports are available on github: busd-contract/audit-reports at master \u00b7 paxosglobal/busd-contract \u00b7 GitHub 23. Has the token (and/or supporting protocol) been formally verified? Not aware of formal verification for BUSD or GUNI LP contracts. 24. Does the asset follow a token standard? (eg. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1400) BUSD and GUNIV3-BUSD-DAI implement the ERC20 token standard. 25. Is the asset, or asset balances, controlled by a central actor, or group of actors (eg. through a multisig or DAO)? BUSD can be frozen or blacklisted by the issuer Paxos. GUNI token is decentralized and cannot be frozen. 26. Does the token have whitelist or blacklist functions? If so, what is the process for utilization and what stakeholders are involved? BUSD can be frozen or blacklisted by Paxos. GUNI token cannot be frozen or blacklisted. 27. Can the token implementation be upgraded/changed? If so, what is the process and what stakeholders are involved? BUSD is upgradable by Paxos. GUNI token cannot be upgraded. 28. Does the token contain rebasing logic? No. ",

I also think it would be good to divide the counterparty risk among different Uniswap v3 managers as well.  I work for Gamma Strategies, which is another active manager on Uniswap v3 with a slightly different strategy than Arrakis that involves a completely deterministic autorebalancing strategy for stable:stable pairs like BUSD-DAI. I just posted a proposal for WBTC-renBTC here:  [UNI-V3-WBTC-RENBTC] MIP6 Collateral Onboarding Application - #8 by BP333, but this same strategy and contract would work just as well with BUSD-DAI. Gamma would be an interested party, and I do see a lot of merit in having multiple parties providing liquidity to the same pair as it lowers counterparty risk even more.  Along the same vein, we just had a successful joint proposal pass on Optimism which involved decentralizing the management of OP-WETH liquidity on Optimism among multiple Uniswap v3 liquidity managers.  We would be happy to offer our services along with Arrakis to decentralize the issuance of BUSD-DAI collateral as well. ",
