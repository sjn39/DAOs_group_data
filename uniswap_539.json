Requires essentially a 1% return on current AUM. I don\u2019t even like sports but without a doubt it could be a really legendary and cultural watershed moment for DeFi and Uniswap. Would also be super fun to work on. I realize this sounds nuts and like a joke, but think it\u2019s cool and also within reach, and would actually end up paying for itself. Thoughts? ",
